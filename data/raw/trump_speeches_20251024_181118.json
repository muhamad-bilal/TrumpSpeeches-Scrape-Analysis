    "transcript": "President Donald Trump (00:07):\n\nWell, thank you very much. It's an honor to have a friend of mine, a very good friend of mine. We've become friends actually through the trials and tribulations of everything. And Mark Rutte, secretary general of NATO, highly respected, every country, almost every country in Europe. I think you can almost take away the almost pretty soon.\n\nMark Rutte (00:29):\n\nYeah.\n\nPresident Donald Trump (00:30):\n\nBut they all have great respect for the leader and he is the leader. And we've had some very good discussions today and things are going along pretty well as regarding Ukraine-Russia. We thought it would be a little bit easier. That's turned out to be tougher than the Middle East. The Middle East was supposed to be the tough one, and we've solved that puzzle, but this one will get solved also. So, I want to just say it's an honor to have you, Mark. Thank you very much.\n\nMark Rutte (00:55):\n\nThank you so much for hosting again. And we were texting, I think it was on the day when you were in Israel and in Egypt, this tremendous success you had under your leadership, bringing peace to the Middle East.\n\nPresident Donald Trump (01:08):\n\nThank you.\n\nMark Rutte (01:09):\n\nAnd then we texted each other and said, \"And the next big thing has to be Ukraine-Russia.\" And I want to help, NATO wants to help, my colleagues want to help to basically deliver on your vision of peace in Ukraine. And I really want to thank you for everything you're doing, including breaking the deadlock with Putin, starting the dialogue in February when you came in as president in January, but also for everything you did with NATO. The fact that we are now at this 5%, the huge success in The Hague at the NATO summit, the fact that Europeans are also stepping up when it comes to Ukraine. Basically the weapons from the US being delivered to Ukraine, paid for allies and Europeans coming together to discuss how can we sustain Ukraine post the peace deal?\n\n(01:50)All of this as evidence of your leadership of pushing the Europeans and the Canadians to do more, to deliver and to equalize in spending with the US. So on all of this, and today we will talk more on how we can really bring Ukraine to the next phase and get this terrible war and all the bloodshed ended.\n\nPresident Donald Trump (02:11):\n\nAnd as you know, we are going to be making a big trip next week. Some of you are going with us. We'll be going to Malaysia, South Korea, and Japan. In South Korea, I'll be meeting with President Xi of China. We have a pretty long meeting scheduled. We can work out a lot of our questions and our doubts and our tremendous assets together. So, we look forward to that. I think something will work out. We have a very good relationship, but that'll be a big one.\n\n(02:40)We canceled the meeting with President Putin. It didn't feel right to me. It didn't feel like we were going to get to the place we have to get, so I canceled it. But we'll do it in the future. But next week we'll be with many of you in those locations that I told you. Then it's back to Washington. So, thank you very much, everybody. Yeah, please.\n\nSpeaker 1 (03:00):\n\nMr. President, can you tell us a little bit about why you're elevating sanctions against Russia right now? What's the-\n\nPresident Donald Trump (03:06):\n\nI just felt it was time. We've waited a long time. I thought that we'd go long before the Middle East.\n\n(03:12)And, Mark, as you know, we did the Middle East plus seven.\n\nMark Rutte (03:15):\n\nYeah. Absolutely.\n\nPresident Donald Trump (03:16):\n\nSo, we did seven different wars from Pakistan and India to so many.\n\nMark Rutte (03:21):\n\nYeah. Azerbaijan, Armenia, Africa.\n\nPresident Donald Trump (03:23):\n\nWhich they said was impossible to do. All these wars, I did. And the one that we have left, we have one left, it'll be nine. We have one left and I think we'll get that done too. I think we're on our way to getting it done.\n\nMark Rutte (03:34):\n\nYeah. Absolutely. We have to. We have to.\n\nPress corps (03:35):\n\nMr. President. Mr. President. Mr. President.\n\nPresident Donald Trump (03:36):\n\nPlease.\n\nSpeaker 2 (03:37):\n\nMr. President, do you have a timeline for when you think the war is going to be over because of your leadership?\n\nPresident Donald Trump (03:42):\n\nNo, I don't have a timeline. You can't have … In war it's hard to have a timeline. So many things happen in war. Go ahead.\n\nSpeaker 2 (03:49):\n\nWhat about Tomahawk missiles? Putin is definitely afraid-\n\nPresident Donald Trump (03:52):\n\nWell, the problem with the Tomahawk that a lot of people don't know, it'll take a minimum of six months, usually a year to learn how to use them. They're highly complex. So, the only way a Tomahawk is going to be shot is if we shot it and we're not going to do that.\n\n(04:05)But there is a tremendous learning curve with a Tomahawk. It's a very powerful weapon, very accurate weapon. And maybe that's what makes it so complex. But it takes a year of intense training to learn how to use it, and we know how to use it and we're not going to be teaching other people. It's too far out into the future.\n\nPress corps (04:29):\n\nMr. President. Mr. President. Mr. President.\n\nPresident Donald Trump (04:29):\n\nYes, please.\n\nSpeaker 3 (04:30):\n\nI saw, Mr. President, that you said as recently as yesterday that you still believe that Putin wants to end the war.\n\nPresident Donald Trump (04:34):\n\nYeah, I do.\n\nSpeaker 3 (04:35):\n\nBut then today you took this step to Russia the sanctions and put more pressure on him.\n\nPresident Donald Trump (04:39):\n\nYeah.\n\nSpeaker 3 (04:40):\n\nWhat else are you going to do to encourage him to get there or can you explain why you believe that he wants peace?\n\nPresident Donald Trump (04:45):\n\nYeah, it's a good question. Today is a very big day in terms of what we're doing. Look, these are tremendous sanctions. These are very big. Those are against their two big oil companies. And we hope that they won't be on for long. We hope that the war will be settled. We just answered, having to do with the various forms of missiles and everything else that we're looking at, but we don't think that's going to be necessary.\n\n(05:10)We would like to see them just take the line that has been formed over quite a long period of time and go home. Last week they had almost 8,000 soldiers killed. Many Russians were killed last week. Many Ukrainians were killed last week. We think it's ridiculous and we'd like to have it end.\n\nSpeaker 3 (05:31):\n\nWhy do you think he wants peace though? Why do you still believe that?\n\nPresident Donald Trump (05:34):\n\nI think they want peace. I think they both want peace at this point. It's almost four years. You're going into four years. And if I were president, it never would've started, but yeah, it's time.\n\nPress corps (05:44):\n\nMr. President. Mr. President. Mr. President.\n\nSpeaker 4 (05:45):\n\nMr. President, on the shutdown, do you plan to meet with Democrats before you head to Asia? And if not, why not meet with the Democrats?\n\nPresident Donald Trump (05:55):\n\nWell, I think it's a shame that it's shut down because we have the greatest economy. As you were saying before, we have the greatest economy in the world right now by far, the United States. We have almost 18, it was 17, now it's $18 trillion being poured into our country. And it's no time for shutdowns. I don't think it's affecting what we're doing, but it's too bad for a lot of people. We have a lot of good people that aren't working right now that should be. And it's because the Democrats want to try and renegotiate a deal that they had negotiated. They want $1.5 trillion given to illegal immigrants who came into the country. And it's going to hurt the healthcare of citizens of our country that have been paying into it, that have been working hard for it, that really deserve it. So we're never going to do that. It's not going to happen.\n\nSpeaker 4 (06:41):\n\nBut, Mr. President-\n\nPresident Donald Trump (06:41):\n\nAnd I will tell you, there are a lot of good Democrats that really want to make a deal. And all we need is five Democrats because we have a great support on the Republican side. So, I think we need five Democrats and there are a lot of them that want to make a deal.\n\nSpeaker 4 (06:56):\n\nMr. President-\n\nPresident Donald Trump (06:56):\n\nSo, I think at some point common sense will prevail.\n\nPress corps (07:00):\n\nMr. President. Mr. President.\n\nPresident Donald Trump (07:02):\n\nYeah, go ahead. You can finish up.\n\nSpeaker 4 (07:04):\n\nOn the drug boat strike in the Eastern Pacific. Can you explain to us what that was about, how it was conducted?\n\nPresident Donald Trump (07:11):\n\nYeah. Sure. Well, they had one today in the Pacific. And the way I look at it every time I look, because it is violent and it is very … It's amazing the weaponry that everyone … That they have these boats that go 45, 50 miles an hour in the water. And when you look at the accuracy and the power … Look, we have the greatest military in the world. We have the greatest weapons in the world. And you see a little bit of it there. One shot, everyone dead center. And the only way you won't feel badly about it, is you realize that every time you see that happen, you're saving 25,000 American lives. Every one of those boats that gets knocked out is saving 25,000 American lives. Not to mention the torn up families all over the country.\n\n(07:59)And whenever I see that, I say to myself, \"I just saved 25,000 lives.\" I will say that there are very few boats traveling on the water right now. Actually, that includes fishing boats, that includes any other kind of boat, but there are very few boats traveling on the water. So, now they'll come in by land to a lesser extent, and they will be hit on land also.\n\nPress corps (08:20):\n\n[inaudible 00:08:21]. Mr. President.\n\nPresident Donald Trump (08:26):\n\nGo ahead in the back, please.\n\nSpeaker 5 (08:27):\n\nDo you believe you have legal authority if they do come-\n\nPresident Donald Trump (08:29):\n\nYes, we do. We have legal authority, right?\n\nSpeaker 5 (08:31):\n\nBut to strike [inaudible 00:08:32].\n\nPresident Donald Trump (08:32):\n\nWe're allowed to do that. And if we do by land, we may go back to Congress, but this is a national security problem. They killed 300,000 people last year, drugs, these drugs coming in.\n\nSpeaker 5 (08:45):\n\nDo you-\n\nPresident Donald Trump (08:45):\n\nThey killed 300,000 Americans last year. And that gives you legal authority. We have a national security … Really, I will say this, when you look at the people we're dealing with … And we know them, we know the people coming in, we know the boats, we know everything else. We're allowed to do it. It's in international waters. If we don't do it, we're going to lose hundreds of thousands of people.\n\n(09:12)Now, they'll be coming in by land a little bit more because they're not coming in by boat anymore. There are no boats in the water, there are no more boats. We know the boat almost immediately. It's pretty unusual when you see somebody with a fishing rod and five engines on the back of the boat. You don't need that to go fishing.\n\nPress corps (09:28):\n\nMr. President.\n\nPresident Donald Trump (09:29):\n\nWait, wait, wait. And we will hit them very hard when they come in by land and they haven't experienced that yet, but now we're totally prepared to do that. We'll probably go back to Congress and explain exactly what we're doing when we come to the land. We don't have to do that, but I think, Marco, I'd like to do that. You may respond to that if you want.\n\nMarco Rubio (09:50):\n\nYeah. Well, I mean, the question is, bottom line, these are drug boats. If people want to stop seeing drug boats blow up, stop sending drugs to the United States.\n\nSpeaker 5 (09:57):\n\nBut does it matter if it's in the United States?\n\nMarco Rubio (09:59):\n\nWell, these are all in international\n\nSpeaker 6 (10:00):\n\n… international waters, the boat-\n\nJournalist (10:03):\n\nWould you do a strike in the United States or if there was a [inaudible 00:10:04]\n\nSpeaker 6 (10:03):\n\nWell, that's a different matter, now you're talking about a law enforcement matter. In this particular case, they are people traveling on international waters headed towards the United States with hostilities in mind, which includes flooding our country with dangerous, deadly drugs. And they're going to be stopped. And that's what's happening. And in the case last week, you saw there was a submarine, it was a submarine, it was a submersible. That's a drug boat all the way through. We know what these boats are. The President just said it. We tracked them from the very beginning. We know who's on them, who they are, where they're coming from, what they have on them. And if you're running drug boats you're in grave danger.\n\nPresident Donald Trump (10:33):\n\nAnd drug usage is way down. And drug usage coming from the sea, they call it ocean drugs, a little term that they use, the ocean drugs is very close to nonexistent right now. I wouldn't want to be in one of those boats heading our way. They're driving happily to destroy the lives of people. And they end up, that's the end of them. So the ocean drugs and the sea drugs, drugs by sea they call it also, that's almost down to nothing, as you can imagine. So, they continue to come in by land and a little bit less because they see something is going to happen, they don't like it. They see something. And they're right, something very serious is going to happen, the equivalent of what's happening by sea. And we are going to Congress just to tell them what we're doing just to keep them informed. So we have to do it for national sec … we have to do it to save lives.\n\nJournalist (11:30):\n\n[inaudible 00:11:31]\n\n(11:30)Mr. President, Secretary Bessent said that Vladimir Putin had not been honest and forthright in his talks with you, just wondering if you could tell us a little bit more about your feelings about that? And also if I may, to Dhr. Rutte, just your thoughts on whether Ukraine should get tomahawks. Thank you.\n\nPresident Donald Trump (11:45):\n\nWell, I think that in terms of honesty, the only thing I can say is every time I speak with Vladimir I have good conversations. And then they don't go anywhere, they just don't go anywhere so in that sense. But no, look, he's fighting a war, he's in a war. It's two very competent sides. And that's the way war is, you never know with war. But I would say that it's time, it's time to make a deal. A lot of people are dying. They're not Americans, but they're people, they're souls and they're dying by the thousands. Worst since World War Two. And we really should stop it.\n\nMark Rutte (12:21):\n\nAnd to your other question.\n\nPresident Donald Trump (12:23):\n\nYeah, please.\n\nMark Rutte (12:24):\n\nSorry, to your other question. This has been consistent from this President when we first met again after your reelection in Mar-a-Lago in November, you said we have to stop the killing. This is close to your heart and this is your vision. That's why this war needs to end.\n\n(12:40)When it comes to tomahawks or whatever system, it's up to any federal nation to decide whatever they want to supply to Ukraine. NATO doesn't take a position. But I can assure you this, when the President called me in July and said we want to again send weapons into Ukraine, paid for by our allies, the Canadians and the Europeans, that was an important moment. And that is now taking place. And the ambassador, myself, we are working hard at this. Already a couple of billion dollars of weaponry into Ukraine from the US paid for by allies. I'm not going to comment about the tomahawks, but when it comes to the US and all the support for Ukraine, it is there and it is close to the President's heart, and I know this.\n\nJournalist (13:17):\n\nMr. President-\n\nPresident Donald Trump (13:18):\n\nI will say this, and Mark can say it better than anybody, the European nations and Canada have really pulled together. And it's beyond even that, I mean, it's really beyond that.\n\nMark Rutte (13:28):\n\nAs well, the Australians, the New Zealanders, Japan, they all [inaudible 00:13:32].\n\nPresident Donald Trump (13:31):\n\nRight. If you want to really add them up, we could really add them up. But NATO basically, European and Canada and a lot of other nations, they've really band together. They are not happy about what's happening with Russia and Ukraine. They're not happy at all. Neither am I.\n\nJournalist (13:44):\n\nMr. President …\n\n(13:45)Mr. President …\n\nPresident Donald Trump (13:45):\n\nJeff.\n\nJeff (13:47):\n\nSir, just changing the topic slightly, I see you've got the model of the White House and the ballroom. Many people were surprised, the entire East Wing is being demolished because you had said initially that the ballroom would not be touched, what happened? Can you tell us what happened?\n\nPresident Donald Trump (14:01):\n\nWell, certain areas are being left. We determined that after really a tremendous amount of study with some of the best architects in the world, we determined that really knocking it down, trying to use a little section. You know, the East Wing was not much, it was not much left from the original, it was over the course of a hundred years, it was changed. The columns were removed and it was a much different building. Then a story was added on in 1948/1949. There was a story added on which was not particularly nice. And the building was very, very much changed from what it was originally. It was never thought of as being much, it was a very small building. And rather than allowing that to hurt a very expensive, beautiful building that frankly they've been after for years.\n\n(14:49)You have that, I brought these along so people could see, but there's a relative … Nobody's actually seen anything quite like it. I think it'll be one of the great ballrooms anywhere in the world. It's about $300 million. It's set to do many, many things including meetings with foreign leaders, including the honoring of foreign leaders. You can see this, this is a plan, it's got tables so that you honor a foreign leader, we have a proper space. Right now we have a space that with tables holds about 79 people. And this is a proper kind of a thing.\n\n(15:29)Now, what the White House was doing, as you know, is they were putting tents out on the lawn. This is an interior shot of the ballroom. I think there'll be nothing like it. And it's being paid for a hundred percent by me and some friends of mine, donors to it. The government's paying absolutely nothing. We're also working with the military on it because they want to make sure everything's perfect. And the military is very much involved in this. They want to make sure everything is absolutely beautiful. You can see the kind interiors that we're talking about. That's an interior of the ballroom. And it's the highest level. And you see it goes beautifully with the White House. I mean, the mix is beautiful.\n\n(16:08)So over the years, many presidents have made changes, this obviously would be the biggest change. But this was something they've wanted for at least 150 years. Many of you have gone to the events where they had, as an example, President Xi, or they had a leader of one of the countries, including the king and the queen from your favorite country frankly.\n\nMark Rutte (16:30):\n\nAbsolutely.\n\nPresident Donald Trump (16:31):\n\nBut where they'd be honored and there'd be in a tent out on the lawn and it would rain and it was a disaster. Brian's shaking his head, you know what I'm talking about. So I thought I'd bring this out because this is going to be probably the finest ballroom ever built. And we're doing it, no cost to the country. It's being put in, the money is being put in by me and donors, very great patriots actually.\n\n(16:57)And the spirit on the building of it is amazing. We are using little sections of footings and various other things, but that's sort of irrelevant. In order to do it properly we had to take down the existing structure. The way it was shown, it looked like we were touching the White House, we don't touch the White House. That's a bridge, a glass bridge going from the White House to the ballroom. Then you get into the lobby of the ballroom. And then you go into the magnificent, the main room. And it's something that has gotten incredible reviews.\n\nJournalist (17:26):\n\n[inaudible 00:17:27]\n\n(17:26)And just quickly following up on that, just quickly following up on that, I just want a quick follow up on that question. Your response to people who say that you haven't been transparent enough about this?\n\nPresident Donald Trump (17:38):\n\nI haven't been transparent? Really?\n\nJournalist (17:40):\n\nThat's some of your [inaudible 00:17:41]\n\nPresident Donald Trump (17:41):\n\nI've shown this to everybody that would listen. Third-rate reporters didn't see it because they didn't look. You're a third-rate reporter, always have been. So third-rate reporters didn't look, but anybody that asked, these pictures have been in newspapers, they've been all over the place. And we're very proud of it. It's gotten great reviews, it's gotten really great reviews.\n\nJournalist (18:03):\n\nMr. President …\n\n(18:04)[inaudible 00:18:06].\n\nPresident Donald Trump (18:05):\n\nI think we've been more transparent than anybody's ever been.\n\nJournalist (18:08):\n\n[inaudible 00:18:09]\n\n(18:08)Why do you believe, Mr. President, that the sanctions that you're announcing today will push Putin to the negotiating table?\n\nPresident Donald Trump (18:14):\n\nWell, I don't know that they will. I think that they'll certainly have an impact there. They're massive sanctions. It's sanctions in oil, the two biggest oil companies, among the biggest in the world, but they're Russian, they do a lot of oil. And hopefully it'll push … hopefully he'll become reasonable and hopefully Zelensky will be reasonable too. It takes two to tango as they say. And we're going to find out. They hate each other, these two people hate each other. You know that better than anybody. And it makes it more difficult than it should be. This should be easier to do, but the level of hatred between Zelensky and Putin is very substantial.\n\nJournalist (18:51):\n\n[inaudible 00:18:54]\n\nMark Rutte (18:53):\n\nCould I add one thing? Could I add one thing? Could I add one thing? What the President is doing today with these sanctions is putting more pressure, of course on both parts, in this case on Russia, it's all about changing the calculus. Making sure that Putin understands that the President's vision this weekend of having a ceasefire, stop where they are, as you literally said, that this has to be step one now. And for him to really accept that vision and to come to the table. And then you have to put pressure, and this is exactly what he did today.\n\nPresident Donald Trump (19:25):\n\nAlong with Europe, I mean, Europe, look, they've actually become friends of mine. I think all of them, we have a very close relationship. And they want to see it end too. They really want to see it end. But I can say they're totally committed. If this went on for 10 more years, Europe is behind them. They just can't let that happen. You can't let what's been going on … Now, it should have never happened. It would've never happened if I were president. But it did happen. I inherited, this was Biden, a man who was, without question, you take a look at the new walkway, the Presidential\n\nPresident Donald Trump (20:00):\n\nWalk of Fame, we call it. Biden is the worst president we've ever had. If he was even a president. The people that surrounded that desk made those decisions. But this should have never happened. It wouldn't have happened. But it did happen. I inherited it. We're going to get it ended hopefully soon.\n\nAudience (20:17):\n\n[inaudible 00:20:19].\n\nPresident Donald Trump (20:21):\n\nYes, Please.\n\nSpeaker 7 (20:21):\n\nYou had a Truth Social post earlier this afternoon talking about a Wall Street Journal report as a fake story.\n\nPresident Donald Trump (20:26):\n\nYeah. Fake. Wall Street Journal is fake, less fake on financial than it is on gossip.\n\nSpeaker 7 (20:32):\n\nCan you just confirm that my understanding of what's happening is accurate. As I understand it, that story framed it like we had just lifted, the U.S, a restriction on intelligence.\n\nPresident Donald Trump (20:43):\n\nNo, it said that I gave Ukraine permission to shoot missiles deep into Russia. I didn't do that. Second of all, they're not using our missiles. They're using, I think, European missiles, or from someplace. But they're not using ours and what they do, I don't control that. But I do control our missiles. They're not shooting our missiles in, it was a fake story. Wall Street Journal does a lot of fake stories.\n\nAudience (21:06):\n\n[inaudible 00:21:08].\n\nSpeaker 7 (21:12):\n\nThank you so much. The president of Colombia in a recent interview said that if you won't change, he thinks that people should get rid-\n\nPresident Donald Trump (21:15):\n\nWe're talking about now Colombia the country, not the university.\n\nSpeaker 7 (21:18):\n\nYes.\n\nPresident Donald Trump (21:19):\n\n[inaudible 00:21:19]. He said what?\n\nSpeaker 7 (21:24):\n\nHe said that if you won't change, then perhaps you need to be gotten rid of. Do you view that as a threat?\n\nPresident Donald Trump (21:24):\n\nWell, he's a thug and bad guy. He's a guy that is making a lot of drugs. We've just, as of today, stopped all payments going to Colombia, the country Colombia, also the school Colombia. No, we settled. We made a settlement with them. But no, he's a thug and he's a bad guy and he's hurt his country very badly. They're doing very poorly, Colombia. They make cocaine. They have cocaine factories. They grow all sorts of crap that's drugs, bad drugs coming into the United States, goes generally through Mexico, and he better watch it or we'll take very serious action against him and his country. His country is, what he has led his country into is a death trap.\n\nAudience (22:07):\n\n[inaudible 00:22:08].\n\nSpeaker 8 (22:11):\n\n[inaudible 00:22:12] the Secretary-General presented his Ukraine Peace Plan to you. Are you prepared to be chairman of the Board of Peace?\n\nMark Rutte (22:18):\n\nOh, there is no Secretary-General Peace Plan. No, no. Really. I really want to correct him because I saw some of that in the media. Of course, many people are thinking how to bring this terrible war to an end and supporting the president in doing that. Why I'm here is to dialogue again with the president how I can be, how NATO, my colleagues and other colleagues in NATO can be of maximum support to get that done. But there is no peace plan on the table. I mean, if there is a peace plan, it is what the president said last Friday and Sunday, which is stop where you are. Stop the fighting.\n\nPresident Donald Trump (22:50):\n\nThis is about NATO. We're a very proud member of NATO. We have a great relationship with the countries of NATO. I think made much better by our visit a few months ago when they agreed to 5% instead of 2% of GDP. That was a big concession. I think that was a concession that two years ago, nobody would've said, even a ear ago.\n\nMark Rutte (23:09):\n\nnobody [inaudible 00:23:10]. Even nine months ago, before you were elected.\n\nPresident Donald Trump (23:11):\n\nYeah, they would've said that's not possible. And the difference is, they're paying 5% as opposed to not paying 2%. A lot of them weren't paying, with the exception of Spain. I think you're going to have to talk to Spain because Spain is not a team player. So other than Spain, everybody's a hundred percent, and you could solve the Spain problem very easily, I think.\n\nAudience (23:32):\n\n[inaudible 00:23:36].\n\nPresident Donald Trump (23:35):\n\nBrian. Brian, go ahead. Yeah, go ahead. And then we'll take Brian. Go ahead.\n\nMark Rutte (23:39):\n\nThe soybean farmers, are they going to be getting support from you soon and your message [inaudible 00:23:43].\n\nPresident Donald Trump (23:43):\n\nYeah, well, they do. So what's happened, you could say with that, you could say with beef, with all of it, the beef, the ranchers, let's say, who have done a great job, have lost their shirts for many, many years. They've really been decimated, and I helped them a lot. I put tariffs on things coming into the country, including beef, and that gave them a chance to finally have a decent industry. We are going to be talking to them. They're great people, but they've been hurt for 25, 30 years. They've been losing because other countries have taken advantage of them, and by putting tariffs on, they've been able to make a few dollars. They've been able to have an industry, but I also want to keep the beef prices low. So I'll be talking with the ranchers and I'll be speaking with a lot of different people, including Scott and Howard, and we'll do something because prices are way down in our country.\n\n(24:40)Energy is way down. I think you're going to see $2 gasoline very soon. I see that it's 2,50 in a lot of places, $2 and 50 cents. We were heading to five, six, and $7. If Biden didn't go back to my policy toward the end, you would've seen it, but he didn't go back to the full policy and he missed the most important thing. So we were way up. I think you're going to see $2 gasoline. We could even break that number. That's a big difference. The only cost that's really up is beef, and the fake news only wants to talk about beef. And what I did is I made it possible for those people to survive. They're incredible people, but they were being decimated by other countries, and I didn't want that to happen. So prices are way down. Groceries are down, everything's down. Energy's way down. Even interest rates with a bad chairman of the Fed, he's terrible. He's a fool. But even interest rates are down. So our country has never done better. We're going to take in, I think, 21, 20, 21 trillion this year. No country has ever taken in more than three, and we're going to take in 21 trillion dollars of investments because of the tariffs. If we didn't have tariffs, we would be a mess. We would be a national security problem, and we've done a job. So I'm very happy about that. We're going to do something very quickly and easily on beef to get it down. The ranchers understand that. They're so happy for what I've done. I saved them. I don't think you'd have any beef in this country if I didn't do that. So we're very proud of that. Yeah, Brian.\n\nAudience (26:15):\n\n[inaudible 00:26:16].\n\nSpeaker 9 (26:16):\n\nYesterday in Los Angeles, immigration officials were attacked by some protesters in an attempt to arrest the illegal alien. Gavin Newsom, other democrats have used very aggressive language in terms of how to address ICE agents out in the field. Is there any responsibility that we can place on Gavin Newsom and other elected officials for using such aggressive language?\n\nPresident Donald Trump (26:39):\n\nWell, Gavin has to be careful. Remember that when I first came in, they had a terrible riot in Los Angeles. They had the fires, which shouldn't have happened. They didn't have the water for the fires. They should have had the water coming in from the Pacific Northwest. They didn't have the waters. They didn't have water in the hydrants or the sprinklers. So they had the fires, and then they had the riot. And if we didn't go and take care of that riot, you would've lost Los Angeles. You would've canceled the Olympics, which is, because of me in Los Angeles. And the police commissioner, the head of the police said, if the president didn't come in, we would've lost Los Angeles. We did not have the capability of taking care of it. And he said it very strongly, and we did a great job. And within a week it was all done.\n\n(27:25)Within one day, it was done. But within a week it was all done. And then they go back to their normal practice of weakness, of not taking care of criminals, meaning taking care of putting them in jails where they should be. Washington, DC, and you all are the best people for that because Washington D.C is now one of the safest cities. It was one of the most dangerous cities in the country. Now, Washington D.C, believe it or not, I'm embarrassed to say it in front of you, but Washington DC went from one of the worst, most dangerous cities to, you can walk down the street, you can send your child to meet you at a location. Your child is going to be fine. We have a very, very safe city. One of the safest and very proud of that. Memphis, by the way, is coming along fantastically. We're in Memphis right now.\n\n(28:15)We had the FBI in Chicago. We're doing things. We haven't served Chicago yet. When we do, Chicago will be, very quickly a very, very safe city. But if you look at what's happening in Memphis, it's great, but you got to look at Washington. People are coming up to me, people that work in the White House, they're saying, thank you, sir. And I immediately know what they're thanking me about. [inaudible 00:28:35] they can walk to work. They would never walk to work a year ago. They can walk into work and they feel safe and secure, and it's beautiful. And I'll tell you what, it's really an honor to add that great ballroom to the structures in Washington. It's going to be one of the great ballrooms of the world, and I think it's going to be something you're all going to be very proud of.\n\nAudience (28:54):\n\n[inaudible 00:28:55].\n\nSpeaker 10 (28:54):\n\nAs it relates to your meeting that's coming up with President Xi, what do you hope comes out of that meeting? What deliverables come out of that meeting?\n\nPresident Donald Trump (29:04):\n\nI think we'll make a deal. I think we're going to make a deal on, the rare earth is the least of it. Look, the tariffs are much more powerful than the rare earth. The rare earth is a disturbance, but there's a lot of rare earth around. I'll tell you, I've had more calls on rare earth. We've got it. Everybody's. We'll make a deal on, I think, everything. I think we're going to make a deal on soybeans and the farmers. I think we're going to make a deal on maybe even nuclear. President Putin, in his call, mentioned to me about nuclear, where we do a de-escalation. And I'm fine with that. I think it's good. I think it's a very appropriate thing. We have the most nuclear weapons. Russia is second. China is actually third by a long way, but they'll be even within four or five years. Too many. And we are talking about de-escalation that's already being talked about.\n\nAudience (29:51):\n\n[inaudible 00:29:52].\n\nPresident Donald Trump (29:52):\n\nAnd I think we'll probably add China into the mix.\n\nAudience (29:55):\n\n[inaudible 00:29:56].\n\nSpeaker 10 (29:56):\n\nMr. President can you convince President Xi to stop purchasing all\n\nPresident Donald Trump (29:59):\n\nWell, I think I'll be.\n\nSpeaker 11 (30:00):\n\nAll that Russian oil that's funding this war against Ukraine?\n\nPresident Donald Trump (30:03):\n\nWell, I think I'll be talking to them about it. I think it's a little bit of a different talk. India, as you know, has told me they are top… It's a process. You can't just stop it, but by the end of the year, they'll be down to almost nothing. That's a big thing. That was almost 40% of the oil, India. They've been great. Spoke to Prime Minister Modi yesterday. They've been absolutely great. China's a little bit different. They're a little bit different relationship they have with Russia. It was never good, but because of Biden and Obama, they got forced together. They should never have been forced together, but they're a little bit forced.\n\n(30:38)But by nature, they can't be friendly. They can't be friendly. By nature… I hope they are friendly, frankly, but they can't be. You should not have forced Russia and China together. And Biden did that and Obama did that. They forced them together because of energy, because of oil. And so, they are closer than they would normally be. I think I'll probably be talking about it. What I'll really be talking to them about is how do we end the war with Russia and Ukraine, whether it's through oil or energy or anything else. And I think he's going to be very receptive. He would now like to… I'm not sure that he did at the beginning. He would now like to see that war end.\n\nSpeaker 11 (31:21):\n\nMr. President, do you think Xi plays an important role in terms of inserting himself and convincing Putin, who he speaks to regularly, to stop the war?\n\nPresident Donald Trump (31:30):\n\nYeah, I do. I think he can have a big influence on Putin. I think he can have a big influence on a lot of people. Look, he's a respected man. He's a very strong leader of a very big country. Yeah, I think he can have a big influence. And we will certainly be talking about Russia-Ukraine. In the back?\n\nSpeaker 12 (31:49):\n\nThank you, Mr. President. Liam [inaudible 00:31:51]. My question is actually for the Secretary General.\n\n(31:54)Mr. Secretary, I don't know if you've seen this, but polling out of Ukraine shows a massive collapse in Ukraine's war for the war. A Gallup poll had just 23%. That's less than a quarter. Zelensky came out today praising President Trump's proposal for freezing the front lines of battle as part of a ceasefire. He said that's a good compromise. So people view your coming here as you're lobbying the U.S. government to continue its involvement in the war. You're obviously lobbying for more NATO weapons to be sent to Ukraine, but Ukrainians themselves don't want to fight the war. So how do you justify that morally?\n\nMark Rutte (32:30):\n\nWell, I'm lobbying only for one thing, and that is to make sure that we end this war. And I don't have to lobby the President because we totally agree on this, and this is what he has been doing from day one. Everything he could do to break the deadlock with Putin, get a dialogue going, dialoguing also with Zelensky, and getting this war done. It's crucial. And the fact that U.S. is now supplying weapons into Ukraine paid for by allies is extremely important. And that's now happening since two, three months. And about 2 billion moving into Ukraine.\n\nSpeaker 12 (33:01):\n\nThe war hasn't wind down. Why do you think that'll wind it down now?\n\nMark Rutte (33:04):\n\nMore weapons.\n\nSpeaker 12 (33:05):\n\nWeapons? You think more weapons will wind down the war?\n\nMark Rutte (33:07):\n\nNo, I mean, there's more to be done. So what you need… What the President said this weekend, stop where you are to basically do a ceasefire and then have all your discussions about territory and whatever. But first, stop the war. This is what you said on Friday and on Sunday. We have to.\n\nPresident Donald Trump (33:22):\n\nIt's a war. I mean, your question's really a fair one. It's a war that should have never started.\n\nMark Rutte (33:25):\n\n[inaudible 00:33:27].\n\nPresident Donald Trump (33:28):\n\nAnd you know how I feel about it. But it's a war that should have never started. And we're not selling any weapons to Ukraine. We're selling them to NATO, which is different from before. With Biden, he just gave $350 billion worth of weapons and cash right into Ukraine and that was so foolish. But we sell them to NATO and in theory, you can do what you want with them. It doesn't have to be Ukraine, but probably it is mostly.\n\nMark Rutte (33:51):\n\nNo, what nations are doing now is buying from this program and making sure that the supplies here are great for Europeans and Canadians. And for example, these are interceptors for the patriot systems, crucial to protect the cities. Today, again, a Russian attack has killed children, or at least seriously wounded children in kindergarten in Ukraine. So we need to make sure that the air defense systems are in place and we need the U.S. systems to do that. And the Europeans are paying for that. And this is exactly the type of actions we needed. And the President is doing that, and trying everything to get this war to end, and starting with the ceasefire.\n\nSpeaker 13 (34:26):\n\nMr. President, do you still believe that Putin wants to take all of Ukraine?\n\nPresident Donald Trump (34:31):\n\nI always felt that way. I always felt he wanted to. When I was in my first term, I was very close to him, relatively speaking. It was harder because of the Russia, Russia, Russia hoax. But I would talk to President Putin about Ukraine and it was the apple of his eye. I'd say it was the apple of his eye, but it would've never happened. He knew the consequences were too great. When we had a rigged election and all of a sudden I wasn't there, he said, wow. I think he looked at Afghanistan, how horribly that was handled, so stupidly. And I think that really gave him a little additional incentive. I always felt he wanted the whole thing, not a piece of it. But I think now he's willing to negotiate a little bit further and I think he's willing to make a deal. We'll see. We don't want him… We don't to have the whole thing. Go ahead, please.\n\nSpeaker 14 (35:31):\n\nThank you, Mr. President. You have this big tariffs case before the Supreme Court. It's November the 5th.\n\nPresident Donald Trump (35:36):\n\nYeah.\n\nSpeaker 14 (35:36):\n\nAre you suggested you might actually show up to the Supreme Court.\n\nPresident Donald Trump (35:39):\n\nYeah, I'd like to. I think it's one of the most important decisions we'll ever have for the Supreme Court. With tariffs, we're strong, sound country. We are a nationally secure and internationally secure country, and we're a very rich country. Without tariffs, it's a slog for this country. Big slog. I think it's one of the most important decisions in the history of the Supreme Court. And I might go there. I really believe I have an obligation to go there. We are doing so well as a country right now because of tariffs. And you have to understand, tariffs have been used against us for many years, decades. And I mean, just slowly but surely hurting our country so badly. That's why we owe $37 trillion. We owe that because other countries have taken advantage of us over many, many decades, over many decades. And now, we're a rich country. We're taking in money like we've never done before. Without tariffs, that would not be happening.\n\n(36:38)And also, I solved, as you know, eight wars. Of the eight, five of them, maybe even six of them are because of tariffs. The threat of tariffs on these nation, if you want to fight, that's okay. India and Pakistan, if you want to fight, that's okay, but you're going to pay tariffs and they're going to be very substantial. And we're in the midst of a trade deal. And they said, \"We don't want to do that.\" Two days later, they call up and they're not going to fight anymore. The peace, they have peace. But I've done that out of eight, I would say six, six times, five times, six times. Tariffs are vital to this country. And tariffs have been used against us by China, by every other country. And all we're doing is using them to negotiate fair deals.\n\n(37:25)And as you know, we made a fair deal with Japan. We made a fair deal with all of Europe, the European Union. We made a fair deal with South Korea. These are countries that were taking so much money away from us, not sustainable. And now, we're taking in hundreds of billions and even trillions of dollars. If this country is not allowed to have tariffs, if this country is not allowed to have the President of the United States negotiate on behalf of it with tariffs, we are put in a position where we're going to be a third-world country. We can't let that happen. I think it's the most important case that we're going to have for many, many years to come, one of the most important cases we've ever had. With tariffs, we're a rich, secure country. Without tariffs, we're a laughing stock. We'll be a laughing stock. And I don't want to have anything to do with that. Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you.",

    "transcript": "Donald Trump (00:00):\n\n… Born of love. We took over a building that was not properly taken care of. It just wasn't. It's a very special building, and we are taking care of it. This was grass, and when you have a news conference, and this was going on for many years, but everybody would just sink into the mud. It was extremely luxurious grass, especially when it was raining, because you'd go down about five inches into the mud. And when we had a press conference here, all the press standing back there, they'd be cursing me. The women would be lifting up their shoes saying, \"You've destroyed my shoes. This is terrible.\"\n\n(00:37)So, we got a stone that's the exact same stone and color as the White House itself, because we wanted the friendly feeling of that light color. And it reflects the sun and it keeps you cool even in the summer. And we've had press conferences… We finished it about a month ago. This is, as you see over here, the Presidential Walk of Fame.\n\n(00:58)And we had this long wall with half windows, because that used to be a swimming pool on the other side of the wall. That was the swimming pool where Jackie would say, \"I hear women inside. Are women inside?\" Quite a famous… I'm not saying anything. This was a part of a movie. And the Secret Service said, \"No ma'am. There's no women inside, ma'am. I'm sorry ma'am, you're going to have to move along.\" \"But I hear women inside.\" \"No, ma'am. You'll have to move along, ma'am.\" So, that was the famous swimming pool.\n\n(01:29)Now it's even worse, it's for the media. They covered the pool up. They covered the pool up, and now it's for the media, and I think we have a small representative group. I don't think they allowed the rest of them. I can't believe it. What happened? They're all on the other side of the wall. Can you believe it? Because this is supposed to be sort of a private event, and there is no such thing in politics as a private event. Lindsey, you learned that a long time ago, right? The great Lindsey Graham doing fantastic. You're up 34 points, Lindsey Graham.\n\nLindsey Graham (01:59):\n\nThat's right. Thank you.\n\nDonald Trump (02:01):\n\nThat's not bad. I'll tell you that. It's not bad. So, we did the Presidential Walk of Fame from the great George Washington, all the way to… Well, I think we have to rate him above me. Less than great, less than George. As somebody went up there, and they say, \"You're the third best President in the United…\" This was on television. \"Third best.\" And they said, \"Who are the first two? George Washington and Abraham Lincoln.\" And I got extremely angry at this man. You know? It is going to be tough to beat, Mr. Senator. It's going to be… John. It's going to be very tough to beat Washington and Lincoln, but we're going to give it a try, right? Hey, they didn't put out eight wars, nine coming. All right? We put out eight wars and the ninth is coming, believe it or not.\n\n(02:54)So, I just want to say, it's great to be with you. And when we're finished later on, we're going to have a little quick lunch, and they do great food at the White House. And this is used sometimes for evening, where we've had some incredible people for the evening, and some of the big foreign leaders have been coming. And most excitingly, on the other side, you see the fence and the wall. We're building a world-class ballroom. For 150 years, they've wanted a ballroom here. We don't have a ballroom. We have a little cocktail area, but we don't have a ballroom.\n\n(03:27)The East Room, it's called, is a very small cocktail area. It holds about 88 people, if it's tight. And we said… I said, \"If I do this again, I'm going to get a ballroom built, and we're putting up our own money, with the government is paying for nothing.\" You probably hear the beautiful sound of construction to the back. You hear that sound? Oh, that's music to my ears. I love that sound. Other people don't like it. I love it, Josh. I think when I hear that sound, it reminds me of money. In this case, it reminds me of lack of money, because I'm paying for it, so it's the opposite.\n\n(04:03)But it's going to be one of the most beautiful ballrooms anywhere in the world, and it's going to be able to take care of tremendous… When you have, as an example, I'm going to see President Xi in two weeks, going over to South Korea. We're going to meet in South Korea. We're going to talk about a lot of things. They want to discuss the fact that they're paying 157% tariff. It's a little higher than they thought. And we're doing very well. I think we're going to do well in that negotiation.\n\n(04:31)We've done well, as you know, with Japan, with South Korea, with Europe. The European nations got together, we made a deal. And it was all based… Without the tariffs, you could have never made the deal. I'll tell you what, tariffs equal national security. Remember that. Tariffs equal national security. You got to remember that. And they also equal wealth for our nation, because we've taken in hundreds of billions of dollars, in a very friendly manner, given to us by nations that used to take it from us. And they used tariffs on us. We never used it on them, because we were foolish, or we were led by people that weren't business people.\n\n(05:08)But it really does. It equals national security. And I wouldn't have put out, I mentioned, eight wars, nine coming. Of the eight, five were based solely on trade and tariffs. India and Pakistan were going at it. Two nuclear powers and serious nuclear… Seven planes shot down. They were ready to go. And I called them up. I said, \"You go to war and we're not doing a trade deal.\" And they said, \"Well, what does one thing have to do with the other?\" I said, \"It has a lot. You're nuclear powers, and if you do it, we're not doing a trade deal.\" And 24 hours later, they called me. \"We have decided not to do it.\" We stopped a war. We stopped a potential disaster, a nuclear disaster, because of trade.\n\n(05:49)And it's been really amazing. But the tariffs have made us a wealthy country. They've given us tremendous defense. They've given us things that we can do for other countries, very positive. But again, really it's national security. It's national defense. And they're so important. And it's incredible that presidents for the most part, didn't know how to use them, went to use them. If you go back, you'll see some of the presidents that were the most successful were believers in tariffs. And I even see foreign countries now, that we are doing very well with taking ads. \"Don't go with tariffs.\"\n\n(06:25)They're taking ads. I saw an ad last night from Canada. If I was Canada, I'd take that same man also, but they're actually on television taking ads. But I do believe that everybody's too smart for that. We have a very, very big and important case coming up. We should win the case based on the legal merit. We should also win the case based on all of the things I just said. But we're a wealthy country again. Last week, as you know, they found $31 million. They came to see me, \"Sir, we found $31 million.\" They said, \" We don't know why.\" I said, \"Was this a good find or a bad find?\" It was a good find. It was a plus 31. We're used to finding negative 31s, for the last 30 years.\n\n(07:10)I said, \"Check the tariff shelf.\"\" Well, those tariffs haven't kicked in.\" \"Yes they did. They kicked in two months ago. Check it.\" He comes back two hours like, \"Sir, you were right. We have an additional $31 billion. Billion, not million, Lindsey, billion, that we just found from tariffs. They kicked in earlier than we thought. You were right. We're a wealthy nation again, and we're a nation that can be secure. We're a nation that can start paying down our debt. And with tariffs, we're the wealthiest nation ever in the history of the world. Without them, we've got a slog. We've got a slog.\n\n(07:48)But remember this, other nations, including China, Japan, European nations, they used tariffs against us for many years. That's why we owe $37 trillion. That's why. But they used tariffs very successfully against us. And we had presidents that never fought it. But now you have a president that does fight it.\n\n(08:10)So, I just want to welcome you to the incredible Rose Garden. It's just an incredible place. It was done, we did it, brought it back to health. It was in very bad shape, actually, and we brought it back to health. First Lady Melania did a fantastic job on it, the surrounds and everything. It's all brand-new wiring. Underneath, there's a lot of wire, a lot of things. Everything, brand-new, everything beautiful. The only thing we did is we had to get a hard surface here, because nobody could use it because of the grass. So, I just want to welcome you and I hope you're going to be here a lot. And we're going to use it for meetings. We're going to use it for press conferences now.\n\n(08:52)We can use it. It was unusable before, and now we can use it. But everything that you see was redone. All of this was redone, and the whole White House is being redone. Some of you came through what they call the Rose Hall. They call it different names, but you probably noticed… I don't know if you came through this door, did you notice the white marble floor that was put there? That was made out of Home Depot tiles, about one foot by one foot. They were all broken, about 30 years old. And I replaced it with book-matched marble, paid for by your friend President Trump.\n\n(09:25)It's like, it's amazing how people like it when you say you paid for it. When I say I paid for it, they say, \"Oh, I love it.\" But it really… They did a beautiful job, the great talents. They were very talented marble people I have. And they replaced it with beautiful paradisial marble and statuary marble, and it's really, really beautiful. I want to thank the outstanding leadership team, and you really do have that. Majority Leader, John Thune, who's been my friend. He really, really has done an amazing job. Thank you, John. Thank you. Done an amazing job.\n\n(10:02)I didn't get to know John as well in the first term, and I've gotten to know him very well over the last nine months, John, and you're doing a fantastic job. Thank you very much. Really great, Majority Whip, john Barrasso, outstanding man. Thank you, John. Thank you. Great guy too. Conference Chair, Tom Cotton. He loves that military. He loves it. He loves the military. Policy Committee Chair, Shelley Moore, clap it up. Shelley, thank you very much, Shelley. Vice Chair, James Langford. Very good, James, thank you.\n\n(10:41)And we have everybody but one person here. Everybody showed up. I said, \"I figured you'd have like… I'd say 40 would've been a good number, right?\" If everybody… We're just missing one person. You'll never guess who that is. Let me give you a… He automatically votes no on everything. He thinks it's good politics. It's really not good politics. He's an automatic no. But I don't know. Look, if he wanted to come, I'd probably let him come, right? I'd let him come. Begrudgingly, but would let him come.\n\n(11:14)A national Republican Senatorial Committee Chair, an unbelievable guy, Tim Scott. Tim, I shouldn't say because he's so… I don't know if it's going to get. But Tim ran, and he was very effective and very good. But he was on this debate stage, and everything else, he was good, just because he's good. But he wasn't as good as they thought he was. And when he got out of the race, he endorsed me almost immediately, and I used him as a surrogate. And I wasn't sure if I should, because sometimes I want a total lunatic to get up and fight for me, and Tim is a really good person. So, I wasn't sure. And I put him on the stage, and he ripped the heart out of everybody. He was so\n\nDonald Trump (12:00):\n\n… brutal. He was so unbelievable. It turned out to be absolutely one of my best surrogates. And in truth, a lot of you people that were here, you were all surrogates. But Tim ripped these people apart. And after watching two or three times, then I wanted them all the time, right Susie? I said, I want Tim Scott get up there. But he was so good. And I said to him, Tim, when you fought for yourself, you were much different. When you fought for me, you were a tiger. You were unstoppable. Really was. You all saw that. What's the difference? He said, I never liked selling myself and I love selling somebody that I really do believe in. I really believe in you. And I just felt that way. And it was so nice the way he expressed it. And I want to tell you, you are a champion. You are a winner. And congratulations. Thank you.\n\n(12:51)I never love telling that story because I'm not sure if it's a good or a bad story. But I'm telling you, you are an amazing guy and you fought for me so hard and I really appreciate it. You got to be my number one choice, Tim. So something happened. I appreciate it and you're doing great doing what you're doing right now.\n\n(13:07)I also want to thank the entire Senate Republican Conference for your tremendous work on confirmations. Boy did we have a couple of weeks. I signed like 150 of them, and I didn't use an auto pen, by the way. When you're signing these important, like a general getting approved from a three star to a four star and all these different things and big confirmations and big stuff, you really have an obligation to actually sign it. I think you probably noticed, right there, number 46, we put up a little bit of an auto pen. We have 45, we have 46. It's very interesting, you have 46 is an auto pen is up there, it stays up there. People like it. It's probably going to stay up there for a long time. It's true. And I know you're looking into that. By the way, the auto pen person said he never spoke to Biden. He work the auto pen, you're not allowed to do that. So if you're looking at anything, just remember it. And remember, they treated us very badly. They treated us very, very badly. So I think you're allowed to just report the truth. Including the confirming of my cabinet much faster than first time. I mean, we went so fast and I give John Thune and all of you credit for that. It was amazing. All of a sudden I was calling John. John, I've got to get them approved. Come on, John. Because I was getting one every two weeks. I had people, they left their job and they left everything, and it looked like they were… All of a sudden it was like an avalanche. They walked in, James and James, my double James I call them, they walked in and they had so many of them. I said, you got to be kidding. Is this like, are you for real. Right, James?\n\n(14:55)John Thune did his job and you got them all done and you have all those people out there working now and instead of being very upset with the fact that we couldn't get them approved quickly, so I really appreciate it. He used a method that I wish you could use with US attorneys. I have 10 US attorneys who are phenomenal, phenomenal, a Harvard, a, Yale, a this or that, all top. And the problem is they're not going to ever be confirmed, I guess. I put them in, they'll be there for three or four months, whatever, and then they have to leave. Because, as you know, anytime you have a Democrat senator, not even two, just one, they'll say because of the time we're in we're not approving that person. We're not approving. They never do. They won't approve.\n\n(15:48)And therefore, because of blue slip, I have to tell the person after three months, I'm sorry, you'll have to leave and I put somebody else in. And I've had Democrat senators say, the only one we'll ever approve is a Democrat. This is not constitutional. And you really, I hope you can look at that blue slip thing because I have 10 people that are phenomenal and they're going to have to leave office, highly educated, top of their class, everything and they're going to have a mark on their career that they were a US attorney for three months or four months and then they had to leave. It's so unfair. It's unfair to the public because the public voted for me in a landslide and I'm supposed to be picking the US attorneys, and this goes for judges also, but actually more so even for the US attorney with a blue slip.\n\n(16:39)So I have these phenomenal people, many of them young, but truly fantastic people, and they're wondering what's going to happen in another three, four, five weeks. They're going to have to leave office. I think it's a shame and I hope you can do something about it because I'd like to tell those people, we put you there and you're not going to have on your resume for the rest of your life you were there for four weeks or six weeks and you left like you got canned. So I hope you look at that, very important.\n\n(17:08)And after your pivotal changes to the Senate rules last month as a result, this is what you did, the unprecedented obstruction by the Democrats, we've confirmed more than 175 public servants, people that are phenomenal to keep posts. And that's just been over the last couple of weeks. It's an unbelievable thing what you've done, John, all of you together. So working closely with me and House majority, the Republican Senate also gave us the largest working class tax cut in American history. And you passed the Laken Riley Act to throw illegal alien criminals out of our country. You pass the GENIUS Act and the TAKE IT DOWN Act with support of our wonderful First Lady. By the way, she got actual support from the other side. It was bipartisan. I think Rand didn't vote for it again. I think it was only Rand did. We had bipartisan support other than maybe Rand.\n\n(18:07)But another one I'm going to ask you to vote for, and it's in the House now. I hear it's doing well in the House, James. It's Kate's Law, young lady named Kate Steinle, remember, so well, probably 8 or 10 years ago now in San Francisco. She was holding hands with the father on the San Francisco pier looking out into the water, this beautiful, everything was beautiful, but the person wasn't beautiful that did this. This was an illegal alien that came into our country five times, was thrown out four or five times, they don't even know, but a lot. And came back and shot her through the head. And she went down and she looked at her father, daddy, daddy, something happened, something happened and she immediately passed away in his arm. I mean, you can imagine. It was so sad. Such a beautiful, beautiful person. Father was destroyed, virtually destroyed.\n\n(19:12)They wanted to pass what they call Kate's Law and it's now again in Congress and I hear we're going to get it passed in Congress, and when it gets up to the Senate, I hope you guys can pass it. And basically very simply, it says that if you're an illegal alien and you come in and you get thrown out. If you come back and get caught, you have to spend 10 years in jail. Very simple. Very simple. If they would've had that, Kate Steinle would be alive today. That was a big event at the time, if you remember, Bill O'Reilly, for those of you that liked Bill, I like Bill, but he was the one, he devoted his life to that law trying to get it passed. I think it's time that we pass it.\n\n(19:57)So that if you get taken out of the country and you come back illegally knowing that this law is in existence, you go to jail for a 10 year period and it's going to keep the repeat offenders from coming in. It's going to really keep them from coming in. Senate Republicans have already voted 11 times to get our government back and open for business. We have record business. We're going to be, I think by the time I had my… I hit month number 12, I think we're going to have $20 trillion of investment, we're over 17 right now. As an example, president Biden had less than a trillion for four years. We're going to have $20 trillion in less than 12 months, and we're over 17 trillion right now. So it's the largest amount in our country by far, by many times, that's in our country.\n\n(20:53)But here's the one, it's largest amount in the history of the world. There's never been a country that's had anywhere near 17 or, it will be, 20 and it's going up fast. A lot of it's because of tariffs, because they're coming in because they don't want to pay tariffs. In other words, they make their product in a certain country and they used to just send it in here and there was no charge, absolutely. Now, if they have to pay a 20%, 30%, 50%, 100% or 2% tariff, they say, well, it's better if I build my plant in the United States. It always amazed me for… First term we had the greatest economy in the history of our country in first term. We had COVID, and we did a good job with that. That was a curse for every country in the world. It was terrible. But we had the greatest economy we ever had.\n\n(21:47)But if you remember, I started the tariffs but I held it off because it wouldn't have exactly been good at the time to tell France, you know what they were going through, you know what Spain was going through, and Italy was going through that by the way, we're going to charge you tariffs. But I had started the process. We were going, the country was doing good. And I took in hundreds of billions of dollars from China, I put the full tariffs on China. Biden left the tariffs because he couldn't, it was too much money. But they gave so many exceptions that they were essentially meaningless. In other words, here's the tariffs, but you don't have to pay if you look at somebody the wrong way, you don't have to pay. So they didn't pay very much.\n\n(22:31)But with me, they were paying hundreds of billions of dollars. And again, I have a great relationship with President Xi. I expect to be able to make a good deal with him, and I want him to make a good deal for China. But it's got to be fair. For years, they were making 5, 6, $700 billion, $700 billion and we'd be making nothing. It was a one-sided… Honestly, we built their military. We built China's military with the money that we lost to so many years getting ripped off. So now we're going to have a fair deal, and I think we're going to have a very successful meeting. Certainly there are a lot of people that are waiting for it. Maybe it won't happen. Maybe it won't happen. Things can happen where, for instance, maybe somebody will say, I don't want to meet, it's too nasty. But it's really not nasty, it's just business. And we're going to do a good job representing you people and representing the people of our country. Unfortunately, in a craven and pointless act of partisan spite, Chuck Schumer, who I've known for a long time, and the radical left Democrats, are holding the entire federal government hostage to appease the extremists in their party. And they are extreme. I mean, I've never seen anything like it. They're extreme. And you know what? We had a landslide election. We won the popular vote by a lot. We won the swing states, all seven. Remember? They said, oh, if Trump could get three swing states, it'd be…\n\nDonald Trump (24:00):\n\nWell, I didn't get three. I got seven. We got all seven by a lot, by record numbers. We won the Electoral college, 312 votes. They said it's very hard for a Republican. It's harder for a Republican. Although now I think we've swapped it. I think it's now harder for a Democrat because if you see what we've done with the Hispanics, with the Black workers and Black men, and recently a poll came out with Black men and women were doing so well.\n\n(24:29)They want security. They don't want to have their city destroyed. Women in Chicago, beautiful Black women walking around with red MAGA hats because they don't want to be mugged and shot and everything else. And then you see a Democrat get up and tell you how safe it is in Chicago. Do you know they've had, in a fairly short period of time, 4,000 murders. This is over a short period of time, 4,000 murders. And they had a holiday where they had 28 people killed and almost 100 shot.\n\n(25:07)And then you listen to this guy, Pritzker. I've known the family for a long time. They threw him out because he was no good. And he became governor. He's got money through the family. He didn't make, he's got money through the family. But they threw him out. He became governor. I said, I wonder how he's going to do. It's a crime palace. It's a shame.\n\n(25:26)And you know what we did in DC is unbelievable. You people, you can walk down the middle of the street, Mr. Senator, you can walk down, you can have your wife meet you at the restaurant and she's not going to be accosted, shot, beat up, raped. It's unbelievable how bad it was. It was one of the worst in the country. And now it's stone cold. I don't say the word, perfect, but it's pretty damn close. They would average more than a murder a week in Washington DC. This is just before we got here. A murder a week. Think of that. In my opinion, the capital of the world, they come from Iowa, they come from Indiana, they come from Florida. And you call up the parents, \"I'm sorry sir, your son has been shot and killed.\" We have no crime here now. We have no crime. And the National Guard has been unbelievable, the job, unbelievable.\n\n(26:24)And it also looks better. I do a tour. I hop in that beast. I feel very safe in the beast. The windows are this thick. But I hop in the beast and I tell the Secret Service, let's drive around town. I used to do that myself. I could drive myself around. I actually like that better. But now I don't think it's a good idea. But we drive around in the streets. The place is looking much … The grass is good, the fences are down. There's no tents, there's no anything. It's just a whole new look. And the most important thing, there's no crime. And we're going to fix the roads. We have great papers. We're going to fix the medians in between the roads, which are half of them are falling down. We're going to take some of the tiles off the bridges, the tunnels that you have. They've been up for 40 years. They're rotted. And we'll put up brand new gorgeous white tiles like it's supposed to be.\n\n(27:16)But this place is looking really good. And we haven't even started the real fixing up of the town. We're getting rid of the graffiti. You notice there's almost no graffiti anymore. A lot of that beautiful statuary marble and red graffiti all over. It had bad signs up, and it stopped. We've taken out 1,700 career criminals and people that came in through an open border. They came in through Biden's open border. And we've taken them out.\n\n(27:45)The thing having to do with all of the elements in the Great Big Beautiful Bill, I'll tell you, it's amazing what we've done. $200 billion in costs for medical, what we've done, $50 billion for rural hospitals. And remember, no tax on tips, no tax on Social Security, no tax. Think of all of these things that we've done. This is the biggest. This is the greatest bill. Social Security, no tax on overtime. But no tax on tips. I got that from a waitress in Nevada. I was making a speech.\n\n(28:23)And I'm at one of my restaurants in the hotel I owned there. I say, \"How are you doing?\" \"Well sir, it's terrible. They're taxing my tips.\" I wouldn't have even thought that. And I looked at it and she said to me, \"Sir, there should be no tax on tips.\" I said, \"Say it one time more.\" \"No tax on tips.\" I walked outside to the press, I said, \"There will be no tax on tips.\" She was right. And we won that state by a lot. That's not a state that we win by that much, David, but we won it buy a lot. So it was pretty good.\n\n(28:56)But that bill is chock-full of so many different things. So it was the biggest bill. I'm actually saying this to the fake news, so that they may be print it, but maybe not, because you people know. It was the biggest bill ever passed in Congress. And what we did was a little risky. We put everything into the Bill, John, right? And some people were against it. They said, no, you got to do small bites. And we gave it a shot and we got it passed. I got a call from John. He said it was three o'clock in the morning, \"Sir, we have four hard nos. Could you please call him?\" I say, \"What time is it, John?\" \"It's four o'clock in the morning, sir.\" So I call up, one of you is sitting right here.\n\n(29:39)I said, \"Jim, could I say hello to you?\" It's four o'clock in the morning, right? He said, \"Sir, you have my vote.\" And I said, \"Wow.\" Then I called up another person. I'll use fictitious names. \"Doug, can I get your vote?\" \"You've got it, sir.\" Then I called up another one. How about Josh? \"Can I have your vote, Josh?\" Because I like Josh. And Josh who can be very difficult said, \"Sir, you have my vote.\" His wife was screaming at him on the other side, \"Sir, you have my vote.\" But I called people and they weren't really hard-nos they wanted a little attention unfortunately at four in the morning. Sometimes I like the ones that don't like the attention, but we'll take it anywhere we can. And we got it passed. Right John? And nobody thought that could happen because you have a small majority.\n\n(30:27)And how about in the house? We had a majority of three. We actually went down after that for a period of about two months. We went down to a majority in the house of one. And I kept saying, you know, because I'll tell you, Mike Johnson's great. The team, these two teams, did you ever see two people more different? One's tall, one's slightly less tall. They are very different people, but they're the same in terms of talent. They did it, the two guys, and they get along incredibly well. We all do. We get along great. But we passed the bill. We don't need to pass any more bills. We got everything in that bill. There's nothing else we have to put.\n\n(31:09)We got the largest tax cuts in history. We got the extension of the Trump tax cuts. We got all of these things. And remember they lie. They will look at the, I saw it the other day, somebody, they were talking about, I call it the great big beautiful bill, but that's what it is, the great big, beautiful, the biggest bill of passed. And what they say, they make up stories. And I saw they were interviewing a senator and they said, \"Well, what's wrong with their bill?\" He didn't know what to say, because there's nothing you could say. It covers everything. He said, \"Death. Death. It brings death.\"\n\n(31:47)Now, if I'm a regular person and I hear that, I say, oh, that's terrible. But it's just the opposite. It brings life. It brings Medicaid, Medicare, Social Security, it secures all those things. And they just are so bad. They said death. It was like death. There's nothing about death. Theirs is death because they're going to lose Medicaid, they're going to lose Social Security, they're going to lose Medicare. All of those things are going to be gone because the whole country would be bankrupt and you're not going to have any kind of medical insurance.\n\n(32:20)So with us, it's the opposite. And it's a great bill. We don't need anymore. And I want just say from the beginning, our message has been very simple. We will not be extorted on this crazy plot of theirs. They've never done this before. Nobody has. You always vote for an extension. Chuck Schumer and the Senate Democrats need to vote for the clean, bipartisan CR and reopen our government. It's got to be reopened right now. We're not doing that. They're the obstructionists.\n\n(32:51)And the reason they're doing it is because we're doing so well. We're doing well all over the world. We're doing well with the close to $20 trillion that I just told you about. It will be that number. But even if you take it down to over 17, that's a guarantee. We're doing well with everything. Car plants are pouring back into our country. AI plants, we're leading. We are dominating China right now in AI.\n\n(33:16)And I did something that I think you'd like because we have an old grid. It's a tired grid. It doesn't have the juice that you need to fire up these plants. These plants will need more than double the energy we have right now for the whole country. That's how big it is. And we can't do that. There's no way we can do that. China's building right now, 52 power stations. But I did something better. I'm letting everybody build their own power plant so they'll become like an electric utility in addition to AI. But if they want to build their own plant and we get their approvals within less than a month, it used to take five years prior to rejection.\n\n(33:55)Sometimes a guy in Louisiana, they had one, it took 12 years and then they got rejected. I got it approved in two weeks when I got into office. That was the first term. And the plant is up now and it's been a great thing for the state. I did it twice actually. I got two of them that were dead after 12 years and I got them approved, both of them in less than a week. And that's what we're doing. Lee Zeldin, by the way, is doing a phenomenal job, environmental protection. I have to tell you. He knows that we have to get them fast and we're getting them fast. So we're leading China in the AI race by a lot.\n\n(34:31)Under Biden, democrats voted 13 times for continuing resolutions to keep the government open. And all we want is simply to ask them to do it. Once again, they always voted for it. They never voted against it. Nobody votes against it. But they do that. And they do. It's partially my fault. I mean, I'm watching you and I'm looking at all these great faces that I've seen really great people. I think with few exceptions, a couple of you I don't like that much, but with few exceptions, great people. And you look at what they do and you look at the game they play, and it's a horrible game. And we have the hottest country ever. This is the hottest country anywhere in the world.\n\n(35:12)And I say this, I'm sure you've heard me say it, but I was over in the Middle East and the king of Saudi Arabia and others also said essentially the same thing. They said, \"You know President, a year and a half ago, your country was dead. We never thought we'd see this. And right now you have the hottest country anywhere in the world.\" We do. We have the hottest country anywhere in the world, which tells you about leadership, and that includes your leadership.\n\n(35:40)So as you know, my door is always open to anyone. It's not like that AOC, how about her? Where she said, she's talking about having rebellions and everything. She said, \"Well, my door is always open.\" But she's not the leader. I'm sure the leaders felt very nicely about when she said her door's open. Who the hell wants to go into her door anyway? She doesn't know what\n\nDonald Trump (36:00):\n\n… what the hell she's talking about. She's the one that started. I remember, I'll never forget, she never took a course on the environment. And I watched her one day and she was on television. She said, \"Yes. Our planet will be dead within 12 years.\" That was a long time ago. Our planet was supposed to be dead. Remember the 12-year theory? We were environmentally dead. Now, these people, they've got an agenda that nobody quite understands. The good news is they don't understand it either. They really have no idea, but the people do. The people understand. We're giving you the biggest tax cuts in history. All of these things, it all adds up that we should do fantastically well in the midterm. The only thing wrong with the midterms is that, statistically, when you look, a president gets elected. And for some reason, and nobody… even the great John Thune cannot explain to me. For some reason, even if he's a reasonably good president and we've had success like nobody, but for some reason you lose the midterms.\n\n(36:58)I don't know why. I mean, the odds are tremendously against, like 92% or something. It doesn't make sense. If you have a great presidency, it only makes sense that you win the midterms, so there should be no reason for it. Somebody's going to explain. There might be some dark, deep psychological reason where they want to vote the opposite way. I don't know what it is, but we have to win the midterms, otherwise all of the things that we've done, so many of them are going to be taken away by the radical left lunatics. I mean, we're going to end up with a communist mayor in New York. Can you believe it? A communist. Remember, I would always say, we will not have a socialist elected in our country? Remember I'd say that all the time? And I was right. We skipped socialist. We got a communist elected, so I didn't tell a lie. I didn't tell a lie. I was right.\n\n(37:49)We'll have a communist, not a socialist. But we've already seen the impacts of the dangerous game that they're playing. Democrats are causing delays in our air traffic control system. So important. We wouldn't have had… This Pete Buttigieg, he spent billions of dollars on fixing the air traffic control that used copper wire going into glass wire. Any union electrician here or any non-union electrician would say, \"You can't hook copper into glass. It doesn't work.\" They spent billions of dollars, they turned on the system and it was stone-cold blank. We're getting a brand new system. We have bids out now. We have three great companies bidding and I want one bid. Sean Duffy is doing terrifically. I want one bid. I want just bid, and they're responsible for everything.\n\n(38:40)They had like 1,000 contractors. Every contractor, they're all running around. In the end, if one of them does a bad job, we want to be able to blame somebody. And it's going to be one of the very big companies, because there's a lot of interest in it. So, the air traffic control system is going to be rebuilt. Over 1 million federal workers right now, as you know, are going unpaid. That's the Democrat's fault. And children, tourists unable to visit the museums in Washington, D.C., that we now have beautiful safe streets, but we don't have the museums open. We should probably just open them. But we are doing things that nobody's ever done, nobody's ever seen. So, all of this and the pain that the Democrats have caused during this reckless and completely unnecessary affair, and you can call it the Schumer shutdown or the Democrat shutdown. You can call it whatever you want. And I will say this, that we have Darth Vader.\n\n(39:37)You know Darth Vader, right? Darth Vader is a man who… I think he's sitting right… Is that Darth? Stand up, please, Darth Vader. Stand up. They call him Darth Vader. I call him a fine man. But he's cutting Democrat priorities and they're never going to get them back. And they've caused us and they've really allowed us to do it. And by the way, thank you. You're doing a great job, I have to tell you. So, a really great job. Because many of the things that they're cutting, like the New York project, $20 billion, we're cutting it. They're not going to get it back. I mean, they're not going to get a lot of things back. They may not get it back. Maybe we'll talk to them about it, but they're losing all the things that they wanted. But many of the things that they wanted are things that we don't want. They're things that are just so bad for our country and we're cutting those things out.\n\n(40:32)So, while they thought they were doing maybe bad, maybe indirectly, they're doing good. The cynical comment that they made all over the place and all of their cynical remarks proves beyond all doubt that Schumer is a calculating political partisan, but we knew that. But he's somebody that's in deep trouble. He's losing in all of the polls. He's even losing to AOC plus three. Remember plus three? What happened to the plus three? Are they still around? When I was at the United Nations, I met the president of Somalia. And I say, \"I have somebody I'd like to give back to you.\" He said, \"No thanks. We don't want her.\" He didn't want anything to do with her. But today, I'm calling on every Senate Democrat to stop the madness, to let our country get back…\n\n(41:20)In the greatest moment in the history of our country, in terms of wealth, in terms of job creation, and in terms of investment coming in, these guys go on strike. It's really a shame. So, I'm asking them to be smart. It's not working. They're getting killed in the polls. The public understands what they're doing. They're doing the wrong thing. And with that, I just want to say welcome to the White House. When we're finished, they do a great job. When they're finished, we're going to all come in. It'll be a little crowded, but that's okay. To the Oval Office, we'll talk a little bit, a couple of minutes. Got some interesting things.\n\n(41:57)And I think I'd like to have, if I could, John, come up and say a few words and we can close it out. And by the way, this is an open mic. It's open to the word. I think they can hear me out on the street. If anybody wants to come up and say after John, say, we're all friends and you can speak your heart out, but we've got to get our government open and the Democrats are trying to keep it closed. Thank you. John, please.\n\nSpeaker 1 (42:24):\n\nMr. President, thank you for having us. This is the fourth week of the Democrat shutdown, but we are all here today because your Republican team in the Senate is unified. This is now the longest full shutdown in history, but everybody here has voted now 11 different times to open up the government. And we are going to keep voting to open up the government. And eventually, the Democrats, hopefully sooner or later, are going to come around. But Mr. President, your agenda is the right one for this country. This is your team. We are your partners in achieving, and implementing the agenda that you campaigned on, and the American people voted for. And you just mentioned it has been a series of promises made and promises kept, whether it's national security, whether it's the border, whether it's the economy, taxes, regulations, energy, Trump newborn accounts, school choice.\n\n(43:23)You look at what we've accomplished so far, it's a remarkable, remarkable team, and a record of accomplishment that can't be matched. And I would argue at least my time here, but perhaps in all of history. So, thank you for your leadership. And we will continue to be good partners and work with you to get the work done for the American people. And let's hope that the Democrats get wise and starting, perhaps even today, vote to reopen the government so we can get back to work for the American people. Mr. President, thank you for having us in your home. You have beautiful homes. And thank you for everything you're doing to make this such a beautiful place. This is America's house. We're delighted to be here. Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 2 (44:01):\n\nOkay, TV. TV, we're done.",

    "transcript": "President Trump (00:39):\n\nWe're going to have a good time; December 5th.\n\n(00:44)Well, thank you very much everybody. It's an honor to be with a very strong leader, a man who has been through a lot and a man who I've gotten to know very well and we've gotten along really, very well. And we had a big call yesterday, as you know, with President Putin, and we'll be talking about it.\n\n(01:03)President Zelensky of Ukraine has endured a lot. I mean, he really has. He's endured a lot and we've endured it with him, to be honest. It's been a long time and I think we're making great progress. So we're going to be talking about that today. We'll be talking about what took place yesterday with my phone call with President Putin and I think that things are coming along pretty well. It began with Alaska where I think certain guidelines were discussed, and we want to see if we can get this done. This was long ago into the Biden administration. I came here and we inherited this, and we'd like to see if we could finish it, end it. We want it ended. So many people have died in this war and we're going to. We're going to get it ended.\n\n(01:57)So, I just want to thank you all very much. If you have a couple of questions, go ahead, please. In fact, before I do that, let me just ask the president to say a few words. Thank you. President?\n\nPresident Volodymyr Zelensky (02:09):\n\nPleasure. Pled to meet you again, Mr. President. Thank you very much for the invitation. Again, my congratulations with your successful ceasefire in the Middle East.\n\nPresident Trump (02:18):\n\nThank you.\n\nPresident Volodymyr Zelensky (02:19):\n\nYeah, and you did it and I think this is a momentum to finish Russia's war against Ukraine. I think that, yes, we understand that Putin is not ready. I think not ready, but I think that I'm confident that with your help, we can stop this war and we really need it. We see that they don't have successful steps on the battlefield and it's good. I think that their armies weak now, but a lot of losses. They have a lot of losses in economy and people and I think this is very important moment.\n\n(02:57)And I wanted to thank you, Mr. President, after our phone calls. Yesterday, I had a good opportunity to meet with the big American energy companies and they're ready to help us. Yes, after all these attacks on our infrastructure; Russian attacks and et cetera.\n\n(03:15)And I had also meetings. Thanks to your team. We had meetings with a good military companies. We spoke about their defense and I want to share it after, with details, where we are. Thank you. Thank you so much.\n\nPresident Trump (03:31):\n\nThank you very much and I think it looks beautiful in his jacket. It's beautiful. I hope people notice. It's a good. It's actually very stylish. I like it.\n\n(03:42)Please, go ahead.\n\nSpeaker 2 (03:43):\n\nUnder the Biden administration, the White House was fearing of a possible escalation. They were not allowing the Ukrainians to strike into Russia fearing of this escalation.\n\nPresident Trump (03:52):\n\nYeah.\n\nSpeaker 2 (03:53):\n\nWould your administration allow Ukrainians to strike deep into Russia?\n\nPresident Trump (03:57):\n\nWe're going to be talking about that. That's something we'll be talking about. You're right. It's an escalation, but we'll be talking about that.\n\nCara Castronuova (04:04):\n\nMr. Zelensky join you in Hungary to meet President Putin?\n\nPresident Trump (04:09):\n\nBecause it's a leader that we like. We like Viktor Orbán. He likes him. I like him. It's a country that's a safe country. Done a very good job. He's been a very good leader, in the sense of running his country. He doesn't have a lot of the problems that other countries have. And so we've decided that we'll be going to be with Victor Orbán and he will, I think he'll be a very good host.\n\nCara Castronuova (04:38):\n\nPresident Trump. President Trump. President Trump.\n\nPresident Trump (04:43):\n\nHungry. Yeah. We're doing Hungry. Yeah.\n\nCara Castronuova (04:46):\n\nWas a trilateral meeting or is it just you and Putin?\n\nPresident Trump (04:50):\n\nTo be determined, but I would say most likely it's going to be a double meeting. It'll be a double meeting, but we will have the President Zelensky, in touch. There's a lot of bad blood with the two presidents, and I'm not speaking out of turn when I say it's very, a very difficult situation.\n\n(05:12)You know, we just settled the war and after thousands of years, I guess. People say anywhere from 500 to 3,000 years and I was in rooms, as you saw, because you were with me, a lot of you were with me last week, with leaders that didn't like each other, but they were able to get along. These two leaders do not like each other and we want to make it comfortable for everybody. So, one way or the other, we'll be involved in threes, but it may be separated.\n\nSpeaker 1 (05:49):\n\nPresident Trump. President. President Trump. He doesn't agree to peace in-\n\nPresident Trump (05:50):\n\nWas he what? Where are you from?\n\nSpeaker 1 (05:50):\n\nFrom Ukraine.\n\nPresident Trump (05:50):\n\nOkay, good. Good, yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1 (05:59):\n\nWhat if Mr. President Trump… President Putin doesn't agree to peace in Hungary. What do you do then? Do you have-\n\nPresident Trump (06:05):\n\nWell, let's see what happens. I mean, you know, what if? I think he will. I think that President Putin wants to end the war, or I wouldn't be talking this way. I think he wants to end the war. I spoke to him yesterday for two and a half hours. We went through a lot of details. He wants to get it ended. I think that President Zelensky wants to get it ended. Now, we have to get it done.\n\nCara Castronuova (06:26):\n\nPresident Trump. President. Cara Castronuova, from Lindell TV, and although I love asking you questions today, my question is for President Zelensky of Ukraine.\n\nPresident Trump (06:35):\n\nSure. Go ahead, please.\n\nCara Castronuova (06:36):\n\nThank you. Our President, President Zelensky, President Trump, just broke it a peace deal in the Middle East that all Americans, both sides of the aisle, are very proud of. But to meet that deal, both sides had to make concessions.\n\n(06:48)Our President has stuck out his neck in many ways to make a peace deal for your war as well. What specific concessions are you willing to make to end this war with Russia? Will you give up joining NATO? Americans have foreign war fatigue and our President, as he said, we need our Tomahawks too.\n\nPresident Volodymyr Zelensky (07:07):\n\nTo me?\n\nCara Castronuova (07:08):\n\nYes, you President Zelensky.\n\nPresident Volodymyr Zelensky (07:10):\n\nThank you very much.\n\n(07:10)What concessions we need?\n\nPresident Trump (07:10):\n\nThat some question. Right?\n\nPresident Volodymyr Zelensky (07:14):\n\nSo many questions in one. Thank you very much for your question.\n\n(07:16)First of all, I think we need to sit and speak. The second point, we need ceasefire. Even now, you see in the Middle East, it's very difficult to hold ceasefire. Everywhere, in every war, it's very difficult. We want this. Putin doesn't want. That's why we need president. We will speak with president today, what we need. We understand what we need to push Putin to negotiation table. And as I said previously, so we are ready to speak in any kind of format; bilateral, trilateral, doesn't matter. Matter, just peace. This is important. And we don't speak about, NATO or NATO. For Ukrainians, it's very important. Of course, it's our decision, decisions of allies, to decide where we are.\n\nCara Castronuova (08:09):\n\nWhat are you willing to not join NATO?\n\nPresident Volodymyr Zelensky (08:11):\n\nBut the most important thing, the most important thing for people in Ukraine, which are under each day's attacks, to have really strong security guarantees. NATO is the best, but weapon is very important. Allies, on our side, is very important. And between us, for us, bilateral, security guarantees between me and President Trump, is very important. I don't know. We didn't speak with details about it, but this is the most important document because United States is very strong.\n\nSpeaker 3 (08:46):\n\nSir, President President Trump… President Trump, you are the middleman right now, hoping to end this conflict. Who is doing a better job negotiating? President Zelensky or President Putin?\n\nPresident Trump (08:57):\n\nI think they're both doing a great job in that sense. We have to get it done. It's, we've got to take some of the hatred of each other. You know, they don't like each other. I say that in front of President Zelensky, but I say it in front of President Putin too. They have tremendous bad blood. It's really is what is holding up, I think, a settlement.\n\n(09:18)I think we're going to get it done and we have to make it long-lasting. As I said in the Middle East, everlasting, right? Everlasting. And the Middle East is a much more complicated situation. You know, we had 59 countries involved and every one of them agreed, and it's sort of amazing. Most people didn't think that was doable. This is going to be something I really believe that's going to get done. I had a very good talk yesterday with President Putin. I think he wants to get it done.\n\nSpeaker 4 (09:50):\n\nRight behind you. When we were in Israel with President Trump earlier in the week, we heard a lot about the difference in diplomacy between President Trump and President Joe Biden before\n\nSpeaker 4 (10:00):\n\nWhat do you see as the biggest difference in diplomacy between President Trump and President Biden?\n\nPresident Volodymyr Zelensky (10:08):\n\nPresident Trump has a big chance now to finish this war. President Biden now is not the president, so he doesn't have a chance to finish this war. And President Trump is really showed for the war that he can manage this fire in Middle East. And that's why I hope that he will do this and we will also have such big success. For Ukraine it's a big chance, and I hope that President Trump can manage it.\n\nPresident Trump (10:44):\n\nI would say the biggest difference is one is extremely competent and the other one is grossly incompetent.\n\nSpeaker 5 (10:52):\n\nSir, sir, sir, a few weeks ago in New York, when you two met, you said that you think Ukraine could ultimately take back all the territory that it's lost so far. Do you still think that's the case, or do you think there'll have to be some sort of swap of territories?\n\nPresident Trump (11:02):\n\nYou never know. Look, war is very interesting. You never know, do you? You just never know with war and peace, but you never know. Please.\n\nSpeaker 6 (11:12):\n\nRussia calls the Tomahawk supplied to Ukraine as an escalation, yet it continues using similar cruise missiles like Kalibr and even-\n\nPresident Trump (11:21):\n\nWho are you with? Who are you with?\n\nSpeaker 6 (11:21):\n\nUkraine.\n\nPresident Trump (11:21):\n\nUkraine?\n\nSpeaker 6 (11:26):\n\nYeah. But Russia continued even using the cruise missiles and also nuclear-capable ballistic missiles in Ukraine since 2022. So do you consider providing Ukraine with the Tomahawk or similar missiles as an opportunity to equalize the possibilities of Ukraine and Russia and push Moscow to the negotiation table?\n\nPresident Trump (11:49):\n\nYeah. Sure. We're going to be talking about that. That's why we're here, okay? Fair question. Exactly as he told you to say it, but we're going to be talking about it, okay? Yes, please.\n\nSpeaker 7 (12:00):\n\nMr. President, your message to India and Hungary, who is still-\n\nPresident Trump (12:04):\n\nYou said India and Hungary?\n\nSpeaker 7 (12:07):\n\nIndia and Hungary are refusing to stop-\n\nPresident Trump (12:09):\n\nIndia and Hungary. It's an interesting combination.\n\nSpeaker 7 (12:12):\n\n… refuse to stop buying Russian oil.\n\nPresident Trump (12:14):\n\nWell, India is not going to be buying Russian oil anymore.\n\nSpeaker 7 (12:19):\n\nIndeed. Indeed.\n\nPresident Trump (12:20):\n\nAnd Hungary is sort of stuck because they have one pipeline that's been there for years and years and years and they're inland, they don't have sea, they don't have sea. And I spoke with the very great leader of Hungary and it's very hard for them to get oil. I understand it. Hungary's in a very interesting position because they can't have ports. They're surrounded by land. So we'll see what happens there. But India will not be buying oil from Russia and they've already de-escalated and they've more or less stopped, they're pulling back. They bought about 38% of the oil and they won't be doing it anymore.\n\nSpeaker 8 (13:04):\n\nMr. President, Mr. President, Melania Trump has been helping you in achieving peace in Ukraine-\n\nPresident Trump (13:08):\n\nWho has?\n\nSpeaker 8 (13:09):\n\nFirst Lady Melania Trump has been helping in returning abducted Ukrainian children from Russian captivity. President Zelensky, do you appreciate those efforts? How do you assess them and did you ask her to step in and to help you?\n\nPresident Trump (13:22):\n\nNo, she wanted to do it. She felt very strongly about the children and she's done a really good job, I think, in bringing it to the fore. We have a lot of children involved. Now, some people say it's 20,000 and some people say it's 300. There's a big difference between that. So nobody really knows. But she felt very strongly about the children. She thinks about the children all the time.\n\nSpeaker 4 (13:50):\n\nPresident Trump, if you okay Tomahawks to Ukraine, what's going to happen if the United States is in a conflict and we need the Tomahawks and we haven't got-\n\nPresident Trump (14:02):\n\nWell, that's the problem. We need Tomahawks and we need a lot of other things that we've been sending over the last four years to Ukraine. We gave them a lot. Now we have a different situation. We send it to the European Union, they pay for it and all that and they have plenty of money. But it's beyond the money. We need Tomahawks or we need a lot of other weapons that we're sending to Ukraine. And one of the reasons we want to get this war over is exactly that. It's not easy for us to give. You're talking about massive numbers of very powerful weapons. So that's one of the things we'll be talking about. Hopefully they won't need it. Hopefully we'll be able to get the war over without thinking about Tomahawks. I think we're fairly close to that. Yeah, go ahead. Yeah, please.\n\nPresident Volodymyr Zelensky (14:52):\n\n[inaudible 00:14:52] just you to understand. So for today, of course we want to finish this war, but the war is another technological war. You don't use just Tomahawks. If you want to target a military goal, you need thousands of drones. It goes together with such missiles. Ukraine has such thousands of our production drones, but we don't have Tomahawks. That's why we need Tomahawks. But United States is a very strong production and United State has Tomahawks and other missiles, very strong missiles. But they can have our thousands of drones. That's why where we can work together, where we can strengthen American production.\n\nSpeaker 4 (15:39):\n\nAnd just so that I understand, so you're suggesting kind of a trade. If President Trump okays Tomahawk missiles to help you launch into Russia then you would-\n\nPresident Volodymyr Zelensky (15:48):\n\nYes, it's about military goals. It's only about military goals.\n\nSpeaker 4 (15:51):\n\nRight. But then you would authorize some kind of an exchange where the US gets-\n\nPresident Volodymyr Zelensky (15:56):\n\nYes, of course, yes. We have proposition. We have brief proposition with our drones, yeah.\n\nSpeaker 4 (16:01):\n\nPresident Trump. I don't mean to be brokering an arms deal here, but is that something that you would be interested in, Ukrainian drones?\n\nPresident Trump (16:08):\n\nWe are, yeah. We would. We have a lot of drones right now. And we build our own drones, but we also buy drones from others and they make a very good drone. I mean, drone warfare has really come to the fore over the last couple of years because of this war. I will say there's nothing like the jets. We locked out a lot of drones in Israel. We were knocking them out for Israel, and we were doing it with extremely fast and powerful jets following the drones and knocking the hell out of them. So we know a lot about the drones and we know a lot about the great jets, the great ones. The ones well, and the B-52s which were totally… they were stealth. They were undetectable. So we have a lot of different weapons and I have an obligation also though, to make sure that we're completely stocked up as a country. because you never know what's going to happen in war and peace, right? You never know what's going to happen.\n\n(17:09)So we're going to be talking about Tomahawks and would much rather have them not need Tomahawks. Would much rather have the war be over, to be honest, because we're in it to get the war over. We're selling a lot of different types of weapon, as you know, to the European Union. We're not in it for that. We're in it to get it over. We're losing thousands of people a week, thousands of people, Russian, Ukrainian, and mostly soldiers. I mean mostly soldiers. But we're in it to see that. And if we can end quickly, and I think we can. I mean, I had a very good talk yesterday. We're going to be talking about it, but I had a very productive talk yesterday with President Putin. We'll see what happens. But the war in the Middle East was far more complicated. We got that one done, and I think we have a good chance. I think President Zelensky wants it done. And I think President Putin want it done. Now all they have to do is get along a little bit.\n\nSpeaker 9 (18:13):\n\nCan you give us an update on the trade negotiations with China or perhaps Secretary Bessent?\n\nPresident Trump (18:17):\n\nYeah, I will. And I'm going to let Scott do that, but I think we're doing very well. I think we're getting along with China. China's would like to have something as of this moment. We'll be meeting in a couple of weeks. We'll be meeting in South Korea, myself-\n\nSpeaker 9 (18:32):\n\nDo you think it will go forward?\n\nPresident Trump (18:33):\n\nI think so. It looks like it's going forward. I think so. They want to meet. We like to meet. I have a very good relationship with President Xi, and we're going to see what happens. But for years we were taken advantage of by China very badly. We were losing hundreds of billions of dollars a year to China. We really their built their military, if you think about it, the kind of money that presidents allowed to be lost to China was just insane. And then when I came into office, as you know, I put very severe tariffs. So we took in hundreds of billions of dollars in my first term from China. Biden, let that go because was so much, he let it continue, but he gave all sorts of exceptions. And by the time you looked at it, Scott, I would say it wasn't the same thing. He would give an exception for anything. If you got up and went out to dinner, he'd give you an exception. So it wasn't the same thing.\n\n(19:30)But I put on very serious tariffs and we took in hundreds of billions of dollars and then I left office, the election was rigged, I left office and that was the story. Now I come back and we are in a very strong position because of tariffs. We're in a very powerful position because of the fact that we have tariffs. If we didn't have tariffs, we would be in a very weak position. We would be in a weakened state. But with tariffs, we've made hundreds of billions of dollars,\n\nPresident Trump (20:00):\n\n… dollars, not only from China but from others. And China wants to talk and we like talking to China. So we have a very good relationship, and we're going to be meeting in South Korea a couple of weeks. And I just got back from a long trip. I'm going on another long trip. And Scott, do you want to say a few words on that, please?\n\nScott (20:19):\n\nYes, sir. So the entire relationship stems from the great perspective the two leaders have for each other. China did a substantial unprovoked escalation last week. We were unable to get in touch with them. Since then, it is been IMF-World Bank Week. They have had working-level people here. There have been meetings. The Vice Premier, who is my counterpart and I, will be speaking this evening at 8:30, 9:00.\n\n(20:48)And then he and I and a delegation will meet in Malaysia probably a week from tomorrow to prepare for the two presidents to meet. So again, I think that things have de-escalated. We hope that China will show the respect that we have shown them. And I am confident that President Trump, because of his relationship with President Xi, will be able to get things back on a good course.\n\nSpeaker 10 (21:15):\n\nIs the hope for that meeting with you and President Xi some kind of trade deal then or-\n\nPresident Trump (21:19):\n\nCould be. Look, I think we're in a very strong position. I think we're in a very strong position. We're getting, as you know, as of November 1st, I could move it up if I wanted, a 100% tariff over and above what we get now. So that would make it about 157%, and China doesn't want that, and they want to talk and we're talking. And I think we'll make a deal that will be good for both. I think we will do something.\n\n(21:50)But you have to understand, we never got anything from China. It was a one-way street for many years. For decades it was a one-way street and they became rich because of the United States. And frankly, presidents that, let's be nice they didn't know. They just didn't know. They didn't understand what was happening to them, but I understood it. I understood long before I ran for politics.\n\n(22:11)I used to watch in amazement at how stupid our country was, how stupid they were. And we're not stupid anymore. And that includes with the European Union, that includes with Japan and South Korea. All we want to do is be treated fairly, but the fairly is hundreds of billions and even trillions of dollars coming into the United States. And our national security is secure because of tariffs. If we didn't have tariffs, we would have no national security. So it's very important.\n\nSpeaker 10 (22:43):\n\nWill you seek China's help in ending the war in Ukraine? Do you need them to put pressure on Russia?\n\nPresident Trump (22:47):\n\nI'll be discussing that, but I'd love to see it ended before that.\n\nCara Castronuova (22:52):\n\nPresident Trump-\n\nPresident Trump (22:53):\n\nI think we have a chance of ending the war quickly if flexibility is shown on behalf… And again, we're not losing people. The United States, we're not losing people, we're not spending money, we're getting paid for the ammunition and missiles and everything else that we're sending to NATO.\n\n(23:15)But it's very similar. If you look at the countries, it's very similar. And we just made a very fair trade deal with the European Union and what we wanted, and we made a very good deal with NATO, too. They pay for all of this.\n\n(23:29)That's not what we're in this for. We're in it to save thousands of lives every week, thousands and thousands of lives. That's why we're in it. And I think we have a very good chance of bringing this war to a conclusion.\n\nCara Castronuova (23:46):\n\nPresident Trump, President Trump, you're a peace president and your cabinet has done honestly an excellent job. I think that a lot of people could agree to that.\n\nPresident Trump (23:53):\n\nThank you.\n\nCara Castronuova (23:53):\n\nI'm speaking as someone who lost my father in a war, so I know the human cost. What would your advice be to American leaders, to world leaders, to neocons, to TV hosts who often speak about conflict in abstract or strategic terms rather than the human cost and the human terms like you have?\n\nPresident Trump (24:12):\n\nLook, my only statement is we have to get together, it's a very small group of people, it's the president, the president, and the president. Okay? Three presidents. And I'm the mediator president, and I'm mediating not an easy situation. It should be easy, but it's a lot easier when people understand each other, when they get together and when they like each other. We don't necessarily have that situation as far as like is concerned.\n\n(24:38)Maybe it can turn around. Maybe it can, but in the meantime we'll have them keep a little bit of distance and we're going to see if we can get it done. This is number nine, okay? This will be number nine for me. I've solved eight. Including the Middle East, I've solved eight. This, I thought, would've been among the easiest solved.\n\n(25:02)President Putin mentioned yesterday, Armenia, all of the different wars. He said it was amazing, but the big one that he was surprised that we were able to settle was the Middle East. He thought it was incredible. He was very generous in that sense. This should be something we're able to settle, and I think we will be able to settle.\n\nSpeaker 11 (25:24):\n\nOn that note, you will go down as the peacemaker, no doubt, and you will resolve this war.\n\nPresident Trump (25:30):\n\nWell, we resolved eight others. It's funny how people say that, \"If you get this one.\" Every time I do one, they forget about that one. I solved eight wars. Go to Rwanda and the Congo, talk about India and Pakistan, look at Thailand. Look at all of the wars that we solved. And every time I solve one, they say, \"If you solve the next one, you're going to get the Nobel Prize.\" I didn't get a Nobel Prize. Somebody got it, who's a very nice woman, very nice. I don't know who she is, but she was very generous. So I don't care about all that stuff. I just care about saving lives. But this will be number nine.\n\n(26:12)But every time I solve one, they said, \"Sir, if you solve one more, you're going to be known as a peacekeeper.\" So to the best of my knowledge, we've never had a president that solved one war. Not one war. Bush started a war. A lot of them start wars but they don't solve the wars. They don't settle them, and especially when they have nothing to do with us. Almost, I guess, just about all of these wars had nothing to do with us, but I saved tens of millions of lives.\n\n(26:39)The prime minister of Pakistan said I saved millions of lives in interceding on Pakistan. And you look at Pakistan and India as an example. That would've been a bad one. Two nuclear nations, right? So, I say this, this is pretty much the last one. Although, I do understand that Pakistan attacked, or there is an attack going on with Afghanistan. That's an easy one for me to solve, if I have to solve it.\n\n(27:06)In the meantime, I have to run the USA. But I love solving wars. You know why? I like stopping people from being killed? And I've saved millions and millions of lives, and I think we're going to have success with this war. Wait, please.\n\nSpeaker 11 (27:23):\n\nPresident Zelensky, this is your third time over here. And by the way, you look excellent.\n\nPresident Volodymyr Zelensky (27:28):\n\nThank you, sir. Thanks.\n\nSpeaker 11 (27:29):\n\n[inaudible 00:27:30] for you, by the way. This is your third time here. How different sitting across from the president is this time versus the two previous times here at the White House, and how confident are you hearing his success rate of solving these prior wars that he can get this war solved?\n\nPresident Volodymyr Zelensky (27:49):\n\nFirst of all, about suit. The same suit, because the same president. It's very simple. The next president will have another suit. Yes. About our relations with President Trump, I think we have important dialogues and I think we begin to understand each other. Yes.\n\n(28:14)And I know that President is briefed very well about situation in the battlefield, and he knows a lot what's going on in the battlefield in Ukraine. And I think it really helps when you know a lot of things, a lot of details about one or another war. It helps a lot. But we're still in war. And I hope that we can manage it. I think it's important.\n\nSpeaker 12 (28:44):\n\n[inaudible 00:28:41] that there are some countries that are not meeting their commitment. You pointed out Spain. They said that it's impossible.\n\nPresident Trump (28:47):\n\nNo, Spain has not come through. No, Spain has not been loyal to NATO. They're the only one. Everyone went up to, as you know, you were at 2% and they all went up to 5%, but Spain disagreed with that. I think Spain should be reprimanded for that. I think it's very bad that they did that, but that's up to them. That's up to NATO and Spain.\n\nSpeaker 12 (29:16):\n\n[inaudible 00:29:16] they cannot be expelled from NATO.\n\nPresident Trump (29:18):\n\nCan they or not?\n\nSpeaker 12 (29:19):\n\nThey cannot, according to the treaty, but they also claim that they are protected by the European Union umbrella for trade.\n\nPresident Trump (29:25):\n\nWell, the other people, many of the other countries are in the European Union, too. They're not complaining. Right? Yeah, please go ahead.\n\nSpeaker 13 (29:41):\n\nMr. President, do you think you can carry the momentum from the Middle East deal over to this deal? And if so, how does that move the needle?\n\nPresident Trump (29:46):\n\nYeah, I do. I think we carry a lot of momentum, a lot of credibility. Getting Middle East done was very important. Nobody thought it could be done. That was one nobody thought could be done and we got it done. And a lot of that was the big hit that we put on\n\nPresident Trump (30:01):\n\n… Iran, with respect to the nuclear they took. That was an unbelievable military maneuver, the B-2s. And many other planes involved, by the way, but the B-2s. I think nobody expected that to happen. And we had 59 countries involved, and these were countries very diverse. You had Arab, Muslim, Jewish. You had every kind of… You had every country in question. Yeah, and every country… You had many countries involved. And we got that done.\n\n(30:31)And we got it done pretty swiftly after we set the table properly. We had to set the table properly. This should be one that we get done. And I think the table is set properly here now too, and it'll be a great honor-\n\nPress (30:45):\n\n[inaudible 00:30:47]\n\nPresident Trump (30:46):\n\nIt'll be a great honor to get it done. The Ukrainian people are great and the Russian people are great. And obviously, they have much in common as we understand. They have a lot in common. It'll be a great honor to get it done.\n\nSpeaker 14 (31:03):\n\n[inaudible 00:31:02] on Venezuela, there are survivors from your latest boat strike. What happens to those survivors?\n\nPresident Trump (31:08):\n\nI'll ask Marco to discuss that [inaudible 00:31:12].\n\nMarco (31:12):\n\nYeah, it's well known there's an ongoing narco-terrorist operation the United States has been conducting. As far as details of any recent strikes, we're not prepared here to announce all those details, but you'll get that information here very shortly.\n\nSpeaker 14 (31:26):\n\nAnd how are there survivors when these are meant to be lethal attacks?\n\nMarco (31:29):\n\nAgain, we're undertaking these operations against narco-terrorists. That's what these are, these are terrorists. Let's be clear. But as far as the details of any recent operations, when we are prepared to announce those, we will, as the President has consistently done. So, you may get something on that later today.\n\nSpeaker 15 (31:44):\n\nYour phone call [inaudible 00:31:46].\n\nPresident Trump (31:46):\n\nLet me ask you. That was in a submarine, right? We attacked a submarine, and that was a drug-carrying submarine built specifically for the transportation of massive amounts of drugs. Just so you understand, this was not an innocent group of people. I don't know too many people that have submarines. That was an attack on a drug-carrying, loaded-up submarine.\n\nSpeaker 16 (32:16):\n\n[inaudible 00:32:16] On Putin, is it your belief, as Mr. Zelensky said yesterday, that the threat of Tomahawks and costs, as Secretary Heckelson put it, is that bringing him to the table the fact that it's kind of a carrot in-\n\nPresident Trump (32:28):\n\nI don't know what's bringing him to. I think he wants to make a deal, that's all. I can't tell you what's bringing him. Sure, the threat of that is good, but the threat of that is always there. Tomahawks are very dangerous weapons. They're incredible weapons. If you like warfare, it's one of the most accurate. We hit 30 Tomahawks in Iran after the B-2s did their damage. We gave it a little capper with 30 Tomahawks from a submarine. Quite far away, actually.\n\n(33:01)They're an amazing weapon, they're a very powerful weapon, but they're a very dangerous weapon. And it could mean big escalation. It could mean a lot of bad things can happen. Tomahawks are a big deal. But one thing I have to say, we want Tomahawks also. We don't want to be giving away things that we need to protect our country. We have a very strong country right now. We have a strong military. We have the greatest military in the world. We have the greatest weapons in the world. I want to get this war over. Okay?\n\nSpeaker 14 (33:42):\n\n[inaudible 00:33:42] Putin-Trump tunnel to connect Russia and Alaska. Are you interested in [inaudible 00:33:42]?\n\nPresident Trump (33:42):\n\nI just heard about it, a tunnel from Russia to Alaska. I just heard about that one. That's an interesting one. We'll have to think about that. I hadn't heard that. We just did a nice road in Alaska. That's going to get us to a lot of minerals and we'd have a piece of it, a good piece of the ownership because of the fact we made it possible.\n\n(33:59)But this came up yesterday, a tunnel from Russia to Alaska. That's an interesting…\n\n(34:05)What do you think of that Mr. President? Do you have any ideas? How do you like that idea?\n\nSpeaker 17 (34:10):\n\nI'm not happy with this.\n\nPresident Trump (34:11):\n\nI don't think he's going to like it. I don't think he liked it. I don't think he liked it.\n\nSpeaker 18 (34:12):\n\nPresident Trump, do you think that Vladimir Putin-\n\n(34:12)[inaudible 00:34:12]\n\n(34:12)Do you think that Putin is here? You're got instinct.\n\nPresident Trump (34:21):\n\nWe had a senator that wanted… Remember, from Hawaii. She wanted a tunnel from the mainland to Hawaii. And she said, \"We can't do that, so we're going to build a railroad to Hawaii.\" Do you remember? She's a current sitting senator. A Democrat. She wants a railroad to go to Hawaii, right?\n\n(34:39)You know who that is, right? She's another beauty.\n\nPress (34:42):\n\n[inaudible 00:34:43]\n\nPresident Trump (34:45):\n\nYeah, please?\n\nSpeaker 19 (34:46):\n\nOn your meeting with Putin, aren't you concerned that maybe the Russian president is trying to buy himself more time?\n\nPresident Trump (34:53):\n\nYeah, I am. But I've been played all my life by the best of him, and I came out really well. So, it's possible. Yeah, a little time.\n\nSpeaker 18 (35:05):\n\nIf you got instinct that-\n\nPresident Trump (35:06):\n\nIt's all right, but I think that I'm pretty good at this stuff. I think that he wants to make a deal. I made eight of them. I'm going to make a ninth. I think he wants to make a deal.\n\nSpeaker 20 (35:16):\n\n[inaudible 00:35:16] Do you think judgment by the state of his economies?\n\nPresident Trump (35:21):\n\nI think that he should have won the war in a week. Yeah, I do think. And if we didn't give the anti-tank missiles, as you know, the Javelins they call them, they got stuck in the mud, they would've been in Kiev very quickly. They were heading to Kiev. So in war, you have a lot of luck too. People… Weather has won war, and the cold and the heat, and all things take place in war. But that was a very interesting moment when the tanks started rolling and some brilliant general said, \"Let's go through the mud instead of going down the highway.\" So, they got a little bit lucky.\n\nSpeaker 20 (36:01):\n\n[inaudible 00:36:02]\n\nPresident Trump (36:01):\n\nBut you know where they really got lucky? I gave Javelins. That wasn't given by Barack Hussein Obama. He gave them shits. There's a statement, Obama gave them shits and I gave them the Javelins. And the Javelins are devastating weapon. That wasn't given by Obama. That was given by… Because at the time, it was Obama. That was given by me.\n\n(36:27)So, it was like one of those things. And you had hundreds of them. Hundreds of them. They're a devastating weapon. We have a lot of devastating weapons. I'd rather not use them. But that was a big moment. When the tanks got stuck, they got stuck. And call it luck or call it talent, I'm not sure what you'd call it, but it was a big moment in time.\n\nSpeaker 18 (36:51):\n\nDo you think Democrats would give you credit?\n\nPress (36:52):\n\n[inaudible 00:36:53]\n\nSpeaker 18 (36:52):\n\nDo you think Democrats give you credit when you finally end this war like they did with the war in the Middle East, and sacrificed-\n\nPresident Trump (36:58):\n\nI think right now, the Democrats are really damaged. Mentally damaged. They want to take 1.5 trillion, with a T, trillion dollars, and give it to people that invaded our country. They came into our country illegally from prisons, from mental institutions, gang members. They want to give them healthcare and take it away from our citizens. We're not going to do that. $1.5 trillion, they want to destroy. They want to destroy our healthcare system. We're not going to let that happen.\n\nPress (37:29):\n\n[inaudible 00:37:29]\n\nSpeaker 15 (37:29):\n\nDid you authorized present CIA operations in Venezuela as part of-\n\nPresident Trump (37:35):\n\nI wouldn't say that. But some interesting things are happening around the world, I'll say that.\n\nSpeaker 21 (37:42):\n\n[inaudible 00:37:41], Mr. President. It has been reported that Maduro offered everything in his country, all the natural resources. He even recorded a message to you in English recently, offering mediation.\n\n(37:53)What could we do in order to stop that?\n\nPresident Trump (37:55):\n\nHe has offered everything. He's offered everything, you're right. You know why? Because he doesn't want to fuck around with the United States.\n\n(38:03)Thank you, everybody.\n\nSpeaker 18 (38:05):\n\nThank you.\n\nPresident Trump (38:05):\n\nThank you, everybody.\n\nSpeaker 22 (38:07):\n\nGuys, thank you [inaudible 00:38:06] as you pass by door. Thank you, guys.\n\nSpeaker 23 (38:08):\n\nThanks you, guys.\n\nSpeaker 22 (38:09):\n\nThanks, guys. Let's go. Start moving. Thank you, guys. Let's go. Let's go.\n\nSpeaker 23 (38:18):\n\nThank you, guys.\n\nSpeaker 22 (38:18):\n\nThank you, guys. Thank you, press.\n\nSpeaker 23 (38:18):\n\nThank you, press.\n\nSpeaker 22 (38:18):\n\nThank you, press. Stand up.\n\n(38:18)Thank you, press. You guys.\n\nSpeaker 15 (38:20):\n\nThank you. Thanks, President Trump.\n\nPresident Trump (38:20):\n\nThank you, [inaudible 00:38:21]. Good job.\n\nSpeaker 23 (38:20):\n\nThank you, guys.\n\nSpeaker 22 (38:20):\n\nThank you, press.\n\nSpeaker 24 (38:20):\n\nPresident, what [inaudible 00:38:23].\n\nPresident Trump (38:20):\n\nI don't know.

    "transcript": "Donald Trump (00:00):\n\nThat's what I thought. I thought it was you. Thank you, Libby, very much. And let me also thank the Secretary of Health and Human Services, Robert F. Kennedy Jr. whose wife destroyed the people on The View yesterday. I have to say that I'm not going to ever get into an argument with her. And you learned that a long time ago. She did a great job actually. Secretary of Commerce, Howard Lutnick. Thank you, Howard. Secretary of Labor, Lori Chavez-DeRemer. Thanks, Lori. Howard, thanks. CMS Administrator. Dr. Mehmet Oz, who's a fantastic guy and he's done really well. FDA Commissioner Marty Makary. Thank you Marty. Senator Katie Britt, who got me started with this whole thing when she called up to say there was a bad ruling by a judge, right? \"We got to do something, sir,\" and we did it very quickly. Probably in 24 hours it was done.\n\n(01:02)Congressman Richard Hudson, a great guy and his wife, Renee. Richard, hi Richard, and advocate Samantha Bush, who's a very respected person. For years, the American couples struggling with infertility have faced crushing costs and their quest to start a family. And IVF is among the most expensive treatments of all. A single round of IVF in the United States can cost up to $25,000, can actually go a lot higher than that, and many couples require multiple rounds for a successful pregnancy. A major reason for these high prices is the excessive cost of the drugs involved. The number one fertility drug used in IVF is currently 700% more expensive in the United States than the rest of the world. And we're ending all of that. It's called favored nations, and we're ending it and we're ending it pretty fast. Nobody thought we'd be able to do it and we've done it.\n\n(02:06)Drugs are going to come down. Drug prices are coming down 400%, 200%, 600% numbers that nobody's ever seen before. Great for Medicare, Medicaid, even social security. Great for everything. I think Dr. Oz. So it's something that's, to me, it's very exciting. I'm bugging him and Bobby all the time. How are we doing with that? And we're doing really good, Bobby. It's really going good. Other countries are agreeing to it because if they don't, we put tariffs on them and then they agree. So it's amazing. It's amazing how that worked out in. As an example, in London, you'd buy a certain drug for $130 and even less than that, I guess $88 as of account a month ago. And in New York, you pay $1,300 for the same thing. So now we're going to be paying, instead of 1300, you'll be paying about $150 and they'll be paying $150 too. We're going to pay the same thing. Favorite nations. It's beautiful. It's a beautiful thing.\n\n(03:14)And we've been ripped off by the whole world for a long period of time. One of the most popular fertility drug regimens cost over $5,000 per cycle, as an example. Wow. Largely as a result of these unsustainable prices, 70% of the employers do not offer insurance that covers IVF. Therefore, most couples with fertility challenges are paying these costs entirely out of their own pockets, which is not really possible to do. Oh, look what we have. Look at that, the great Maria Bartiromo. I didn't know, did you get put into the regular pool pack? That's very good. That's good. Nice to see you. I'm doing an interview with her a little while. In the Trump administration. We want to make it easier for all couples to have babies, raise children and shut the families they've always dreamed about. That's why today I am pleased to announce that after extensive negotiations, EMD Serono, the largest fertility drug manufacturer in the world, has agreed to provide massive discounts to all fertility drugs they sell in the United States, including the most popular drug of all the IVF drug.\n\n(04:29)So is that a proper pronunciation? Close enough, right? Gonal-F. As part of this agreement, EMD Serono will list their fertility drugs online attrumpRx.govat very, very heavily reduced prices. Prices that you won't even believe. And ultimately that's because of the favorite nations. In addition, the FDA will be working with the company to expedite review and approval of another common fertility IVF drug. And currently it's selling in Europe. It's Pergoveris, and that's a nice name, Pergoveris. Why can't you name them nice, simple names, nice. Doesn't matter. If it works, that's all we care about, right? Upon approval, this drug would directly compete against a much more expensive option that currently is a monopoly in the American market. And this will bring down costs very significantly, and the other one's going to have to come down Also. Finally, EMD Serono has agreed that all future drugs and everything that it develops and sells in the United States will be offset at most favored nation prices.\n\n(05:48)I've been after this for a long time and we started the process in the last administration and then we had a little thing called COVID that came up, we had a focus on that, did a good job in that too. And they'll bring a significant portion of their drug manufacturing back to the United States. So they're going to bring it largely back into the United States. And that's for a lot of reasons, but primarily because of the election result. November 5th, and maybe most importantly because of the tariffs, because if they do it here, there are no tariffs. So we are going to be very close. I think by the end of this year, we're going to be very close to $20 trillion in investment. As an example, the Biden administration had substantially less than $1 trillion for four years. Maria, can you imagine four years less than one.\n\n(06:40)We're going to break $20 trillion of investment and we're already over 17 trillion. And that's in eight months. Can you believe that? And he was at less than one trillion. And in addition to that, he had open borders allowing millions of people to pour in, what an administration that was. Worst president in history by far. As a result of these actions, the per cycle cost of drugs used and IVF will fall by an estimated 73% for American consumers. And the numbers are going to actually be very substantially higher as time goes by when it really kicks in for most. I mean, think of those numbers. I told the story last time we were with Pfizer and Pfizer's doing something very similar, but I told them that my first term, I was so proud of myself because I was the first president in 28 years where drug prices went down for the year.\n\n(07:36)And you know what? They went down one eighth of 1%. One eighth of 1%. Now I'm getting them down. Maria, 500, 600, 800% in some cases, even more than that. It's hard to believe. But I was proud. I said, \"Oh wow, I'm the first one,\" one eighth of 1%. And I was proud of that. Now I realized, and I called the news conference. Some of you are at that news conference actually, and I said, \"Ladies and gentlemen, congratulations. We've gone down by one eighth of 1%.\" And now we're going down 5, 6, 700, 800%, Richard. So it's really something for most administrations and all of the people involved in this kind of thing, this action would be a crowning achievement of their agenda for fertility health. But for us, it's really just the beginning. It's just a start. It's one of many things we're doing.\n\n(08:28)Today we're also taking historic steps to vastly expand access to insurance coverage for fertility care, including IVF, something that as you know was not covered. Effective immediately for the first time ever we will make it legal for companies to offer supplemental insurance plans specifically for fertility. That's never been done before. We're signing it in today with what we signed. Americans will be able to opt in to specialized coverage just as they get vision and dental insurance. They're going to get fertility insurance for the first time. So I don't know. I don't know how well these things are covered. I see the Democrats like to take credit for all of the things we do. We do the things that they take the credit. But I figure if you do enough of these eventually people are going to figure it out. The Democrats have done nothing. This will make all fertility care, including IVF, far more affordable and accessible. And by providing coverage at every step of the way, it will reduce the number of people who ultimately need to resort to IVF because couples will be able to identify and address problems early. The result will be healthier pregnancies, healthier babies, and many more beautiful American children. It's a big factor. It's a big deal. I'm asking all employers to make these new fertility benefit options available to their employees immediately. The initiatives I've just announced are the boldest and most significant actions ever taken by any president to bring the miracle of life into more American homes. And I will say Katie was great, as you know, she's a great senator from Alabama. She's the first one that told me about this. I had not known too much about it, and we worked very rapidly together, didn't we though? We had everything passed and Alabama then took care of it and passed it.\n\n(10:29)Within a week everything was done. Really, it was something. So I want to thank Katie Britt. There's no deeper happiness and joy of raising children. And now millions of Americans struggling with infertility will have a new chance to share the greatest experience of them all. So I'd like to thank all of the people that are here and I think we'll start with Dr. Oz and Ms. Horn. We'll go through the list and we'll listen. And yesterday I did this and I stood for about an hour and a half as people spoke, and I said, \"This time I'm sitting right there and I'm going to watch you.\" I stood for an hour and a half like this. I said, \"You got to be kidding.\" Here we go. It was one after another and it was wonderful listening to him. But I said, \"If I have to do this every day, Bobby, should I say or sit?\" Thank you, Bobby. Please. Dr. Oz.\n\nKatie Britt (11:27):\n\nMr. President. I'm going to jump in here real quick. I want to start by thanking President Trump, sir, from the very first phone call we ever had your support was strong. It was steadfast. It was unwavering. And because of you, millions of Americans are going to have a greater opportunity to bring the greatest gift, in my opinion, life into this world. Your support, your administration support, it's a game-changer. All of us here today are aligned. This is a celebration of life. It's a celebration of parents, it's a celebration of families, and it's a celebration for those people who want to one day be parents themselves. I think every parent can attest, and I certainly do myself, that the greatest gift that God has ever given me is the ability to be a mom. We want more people to have that opportunity. We want to make that easier and more affordable.\n\n(12:38)IVF is what makes the difference for so many families that are facing infertility. So you've seen the numbers. It's either one in eight couples or some people say as much as one in six are actually experiencing issues with fertility, it's 9% of males and at least 11% of females that are facing these challenges as they work to build their family. The recommendations today that President Trump has set forth are going to expand IVF coverage to nearly a million more families, and they're going to drive down cost significantly. Mr. President, this is the most pro-IVF thing that any president in the history of the United States of America has done. And Mr. President, it's your leadership. You are the reason why the Republican Party is now the party of parents. We are the party of families. This is why when Senator Cruz and I worked last year, we got every single Republican senator to sign on and say that they supported nationwide access to IVF.\n\n(13:58)And just for the record, IVF is legal and accessible in all 50 states. And President Trump taking this action today to lower cost, to bring these issues to the forefront and to enact solutions for people working to start their families. I want you to know it's significant and there's more to come, but this isn't the only thing that you've done to prove that we're the party of parents and we're the party of families. If you look at the working family tax cut, guys, he made sure that hard-working parents were front and center in that legislation. Whether it was child tax credits being expanded and made permanent, whether it was Trump accounts that are going to change the game for so many parents, or whether it was childcare. So for decades, we have heard Democrats talk about\n\nKatie Britt (15:00):\n\n… child care. President Trump actually took action on the affordability and accessibility of child care. We know that one in four families say that they hesitate to have more children because of the cost and because of child care cost.\n\n(15:18)For the first time, this man actually took steps to change the dynamics for hardworking parents. So of the three tax credits that he reformed and the working families tax cuts, two of them had not been touched in two decades and one of them had not been touched since 1986. So President Reagan was in office the last time anybody did anything about it, but you changed the game on that and I was proud to lead that effort in the Senate.\n\n(15:48)And so on behalf of moms and dads, on behalf of grandparents and sisters and aunts and uncles and brothers and people who are looking to expand their family, we say thank you. Thank you for all you do to support families in this country and make a healthier environment and an easier one for us to grow the very most important thing.\n\nPresident Donald Trump (16:12):\n\nGreat. Thank you.\n\nKatie Britt (16:19):\n\nGod bless.\n\nPresident Donald Trump (16:20):\n\nSo nice. Thank you very much.\n\nDr. Mehmet Oz (16:20):\n\nSo let's set the stage. To put it in perspective: two weeks ago, as President Trump alluded, a leading US drug manufacturer came into this room and agreed to do something none of us thought was possible, a most-favored-nation, should agreement with numbers. Again, inconceivable.\n\n(16:35)Last week, a leading a company from Europe, a global leader in the pharmaceutical sector, came to this office, made the same kind of commitment for most-favored-nation pricing. Again, because the president insisted on it and was persistent, and he alluded to the fact that he was calling Secretary Kennedy and me quite a bit. He definitely was with great insights into the process and would not hold back.\n\n(16:57)But I think what you're seeing today is something even larger. It's larger because we're now showing that MFN is the tool that can get other initiatives going as well. We are reviewing perhaps the most important MFN opportunity at all because it's about procreation, it's about babies.\n\n(17:12)It turns out that MFN is a tool for a lot of things, and it goes without saying that you get the drug pricing down, but lots of other business necessities become possible when that occurs.\n\n(17:23)So Secretary Kennedy and I, who's a wonderful leader, talk frequently about family. I think the reason he's a great leader and president as well is because they have large families and they take pride in the joy that it gives us. But many families, as Senator Britt alluded, do not have the ability to have children.\n\n(17:39)But it turns out that it's about one in three families, a much higher number that don't have the number of babies they desire. They're under-babied. So this president committed to address that during the campaign, and he's delivering on that today in a way I don't think anyone thought was possible.\n\n(17:55)We are opening the door with MFN pricing and tariffs that supported Secretary Lutnick with a new approach to make reproductive medicine more affordable for Americans. Now, I know what you're all thinking, and you're probably right, there're going to be a lot of Trump babies. I think that's probably a good thing.\n\n(18:10)But it turns out the fundamental creative force in society is about making babies. It's about creating. And this country, the one that President Trump is leading so beautifully has been a country of abundance, not scarcity. To have abundance, you have to address the fact that we had 3.6 million babies last year, which is beautiful. 3.6 million miracles. That's half a million less babies than we would ideally have had even to replace our current population.\n\n(18:37)Building on the success of the last two weeks, our team led by the head of Medicare, Chris Klump is standing over there and Ines Hernandez have negotiated a spectacular MFN deal to reduce the cost of IVF drug prices by $2,200 a cycle. That's nearly half of the price that it had been.\n\n(18:59)The most prescribed drug in this category in America made by EMD Serono is described over here, and you'll notice President Trump, these are discounted from $242 to $10. I don't know what the math is on that. We can't even calculate it.\n\nPresident Donald Trump (19:14):\n\nA lot.\n\nDr. Mehmet Oz (19:14):\n\nIt's a lot. It's too high to calculate without a more studied approach, but I give it up there because that number of $10 will apply for every American who earns less than $115,000 a year. That's 70% of the American people. The remaining folks who are able to make more would have to pay a tiny bit more, but it's still most-favored-nation pricing no different from what the Europeans are willing to pay.\n\n(19:39)Now, to make this deal happen, Chris and Inma had to do something special. They had to actually not just get the drug price down, but get the middlemen to let it go as well. And Mr. President, we met with the middlemen in the past. They're now joining the MFN movement.\n\n(19:52)I want to thank Express Scripts, Freedom pharmacy; and then CVS Specialty Pharmacy because they were willing to stand up and do the right thing for the American people by answering the president's call and slashing their prices.\n\n(20:03)Now, this announcement also encompasses a remarkable move from Marty Makary and Marty Makary is, of course, the leader of the FDA, but he has ongoing efforts to accelerate their approval of innovative medicines that will further reduce the price and make this whole process more seamless for the American people.\n\n(20:21)Now, you're about to hear about a spectacular new program that's been alluded to, but one of the architects of that program, Heidi Overton, deputy director of the White House Domestic Policy Council, is going to take us through the exciting details of what this is going to offer for the American people, especially those who are in the workforce.\n\n(20:39)But first, we think you should hear from Libby Horne. Libby is EMD Serrano's head of fertility. She brings both professional expertise and a personal connection to this work. She has three beautiful daughters, and she has personally benefited from reproductive medicine that has shaped her family and her company made today's MFM pricing possible. Libby.\n\nLibby Horne (20:58):\n\nThank you Dr. Oz. Thank you, Mr. President. Today, we gather on this national stage to celebrate a historic step forward in expanding access to fertility treatments for those who need it most. Mr. President, thanks to your leadership and the tireless efforts of your team, this is a momentous day for Americans who struggle but remain hopeful to build their families.\n\n(21:26)Infertility is on the rise in our country. One in eight couples face infertility. This isn't just a number; it's real lives, dreams, and aspirations of hardworking Americans. The teacher who goes to school each day surrounded by children but aching for children of her own, the firefighter who puts his life on the line but can't create the life he wants at home.\n\n(21:55)The consequences of these challenges can take significant tolls. Some of you watching today have given up or are frustrated because access to IVF treatments has been out of reach. That's why expanding access to IVF has been an issue of great importance to the president.\n\n(22:14)He made this clear in his executive order, declaring the administration's goal of supporting American families by enabling access and eliminating barriers to IVF. Today, EMD Serono is proud to help President Trump deliver on his promise to you.\n\n(22:33)Thanks to the president's leadership, EMD Serono has worked alongside distributors and other partners to help more families have access to services and innovations that are consistent with other countries. Through our partnership with the administration, we are proud to announce that Americans will have access to our leading IVF therapies for an 84% discount off list prices.\n\nSpeaker X (22:55):\n\nThat's amazing.\n\nLibby Horne (23:00):\n\nThank you, Mr. President. Thank you. Thank you for making this possible.\n\nPresident Donald Trump (23:01):\n\nThank you very much. That's great. Fantastic.\n\nLibby Horne (23:05):\n\nFor more than 40 years, EMD Serono has been a global leader in fertility. Our science was instrumental in the birth of the first IVF baby in the US, and we've helped to bring more than 6 million babies into the world since then. Our purpose is to help create, improve, and prolong life. That means discovering more medicines and bringing them to patients faster.\n\n(23:27)FDA Commissioner Makary has made it a priority to ensure that Americans have access to the world's most innovative treatments as quickly as possible. To that end, EMD Serono is filing a new IVF therapy called Pergoveris for review under the FDA Commissioner's National Priority Voucher Program.\n\n(23:46)If approved, Pergoveris would combine two key reproductive hormones in synergy designed to mimic reproductive physiology. This therapeutic option could mean fewer injections, fewer co-pays, and lower self-pay cost, all of which make a real difference in the IVF patient experience.\n\n(24:04)In closing, on behalf of EMD Serono, I want to send my heartfelt thanks to President Trump and the entire administration for their leadership and vision in this critical area of healthcare. Together we will make a difference in the lives of countless families across this nation and uphold our long-standing legacy of creating life. Thank you.\n\nPresident Donald Trump (24:28):\n\nThank you. [inaudible 00:24:29].\n\nLibby Horne (24:34):\n\nWonderful.\n\nHeidi Overton (24:37):\n\nMr. President, thank you for your bold leadership that's allowed our teams to go far beyond what anyone thought was possible. On behalf of the Domestic Policy Council and Vince Haley here, we would like to also thank all the agency partners and the stakeholders that we worked with to get to the solution today that will make a real impact for families.\n\n(24:55)Specifically today's historic actions four in total that you see are made possible by coordination of all of the White House team and seven agencies, many of who are represented here and their teams that have worked tirelessly.\n\n(25:07)As you described, Mr. President, the current system isn't working. Seven in 10 Americans don't have coverage to IVF. They face high costs and uncertain outcomes, and there's intense demand for fertility benefits. 65% of Americans say that they would leave their current job just because of fertility benefits. So you asked us to lower costs and to fix the broken incentives in healthcare.\n\n(25:31)In addition to lowering the cost of drugs by 73% or $2,200 per cycle, which if you missed it, most people require two or three cycles, so that's significant savings for families. I'm also going to briefly outline the new solution for coverage. This is a new fertility benefit option that employers can immediately offer to their employees starting today.\n\n(25:55)This afternoon, the departments of labor, health and human services, and Treasury will be releasing guidance that for the first time creates a legal pathway for employers to offer fertility benefit packages to people that need them similar to how dental, vision, and life insurance are currently offered. This will be followed up by a regulation.\n\n(26:15)These benefits can address the continuum of fertility needs from the root causes of IVF, which Secretary Kennedy is working on very hard at HHS to… Sorry… It'll be a coordinated package that does not exist in traditional health insurance today. It'll make it easier for employers, including small and mid-size employers to compete for talented employees.\n\n(26:43)Currently, many small businesses cannot afford to offer fertility benefits at all. This is making it possible for them to offer benefits the same way that large companies like Amazon and others offer benefits. This is a pro-family benefit expansion that will transform clinical outcomes by addressing fragmented coverage and care. I'm a physician by training, and it's very important that we have high-quality care. Fertility benefit companies are poised to offer packages that have reported so far, roughly 25% higher live birth rates for those that seek care compared to those that don't have such benefits. They also report fewer cycles to achieve pregnancy, improved natural pregnancy rates through better care before you need IVF, and reduced chance of miscarriages--a 21% reduction in miscarriage rate.\n\nPresident Donald Trump (27:31):\n\nWow.\n\nHeidi Overton (27:32):\n\nLeading physicians in the field have also relayed that these types of benefits significantly improve the patient and doctor experience, allowing both to focus on care rather than navigating the bureaucracy.\n\n(27:44)These impacts are very personal. Here with us today are my good friends, Congressman Richard Hudson of North Carolina and his wife, Renee Hudson. Both have worked in public service for years, including Renee for all four years of your past administration, Mr. President, and they struggled with infertility. Today, they have a beautiful son who's their pride and joy. He's an amazing boy, but they also suffered multiple losses throughout their fertility journey, something that is very common.\n\n(28:10)Unfortunately, too many people go through the hard arduous process of IVF and still result in the miscarriage. So today, your option is not only saving money, it's going to improve the quality of care significantly.\n\n(28:27)This new benefit option simultaneously represents the greatest opportunity to expand coverage of IVF that the federal government has ever taken, while also improving the care delivered.\n\n(28:37)Additionally, and very importantly, it gives employers maximum flexibility to design benefits that are consistent with their values. Put simply, this new fertility benefit option means lower costs and more healthy babies. So today, this announcement, we are realigning the industry towards the simple metric of more healthy babies at lower costs.\n\n(28:59)I would now like to introduce Samantha Busch, the wife of NASCAR driver, Kyle Busch, who's been a leading advocate for IVF access and affordability after your own infertility journey. Thank you, Mr. President.\n\nPresident Donald Trump (29:13):\n\nThank you. [inaudible 00:29:13]\n\nSamantha Busch (29:13):\n\nHello everyone. My husband, Kyle and I battled infertility for over a decade before being blessed with our two beautiful children, Brexton, who's 10, and our daughter Lennix, who's now three.\n\n(29:25)But our journey was long and painful. We faced six rounds of IVF, multiple miscarriages, multiple failed cycles, and countless moments of heartbreak. We faced the roller coaster of hope and devastation that so many families know all too well.\n\n(29:42)Through it all, we held onto faith, each other, and the belief that somehow, someday God would turn our pain into purpose. We also saw firsthand the staggering financial burden that comes with infertility treatments. Sitting in the waiting room of our fertility clinic, we overheard another\n\nSamantha Busch (30:00):\n\n… couple, quietly say that money was the only thing standing in their way of having their family. In that moment, Kyle and I looked at each other and we knew God was planting a seed in our hearts, a calling to take action. In 2015, that calling became the Bundle of Joy Fund, a non-profit foundation dedicated to providing financial assistance to couples struggling with infertility. What began as a small act of faith has now grown into something far greater than we could have ever imagined. To date, we've granted over $2 million directly to individuals helping them pay for their IVF treatments, and we've celebrated the birth of 108 beautiful babies through our fund.\n\n(30:46)Thank you.\n\n(30:50)Each baby is a living, breathing testament to hope community and God's grace. For every tear we cried, for every shot we gave, every doctor's appointment that ended in disappointment, Kyle and I knew there had to be a greater reason. This was God's plan for us to use our journey to advocate, empower, and be the voice to those battling in silence. Over the past 12 years, we've worked hard to raise awareness, erase stigma, and bring hope to the one in six couples that will face infertility. Infertility can be incredibly isolating. It can leave you questioning your faith, your body, and your future. But it can also reveal a strength that you never knew you had inside of you. It can deepen love, it can bring couples closer together, and it unites people through a shared struggle.\n\n(31:40)Our goal has always been to show others that they are not alone. That there is a powerful community of infertility warriors behind them. Today, seeing President Trump acknowledge infertility on a national stage is profoundly moving. It's no longer a whispered conversation behind closed doors. It is a recognized, validated struggle that so many families have to endure. His leadership reminds us that those in positions of power can make real and lasting changes for generations to come. Their willingness to bring this issue forward shows that they not only hear our community, but they truly care about us.\n\n(32:22)Thank you Mr. President and to your family for shining a light on infertility and for standing by couples like Kyle and I, for standing by couples who only want to hear the words mommy and daddy, who want to watch our children open their Christmas presents on Christmas morning, who want to see the world anew through the joy in their kids' eyes. Your acknowledgement honors the power of family, faith, and love, the very values that make America the greatest country in the world. It's proof that when promises are made and promises are kept, lives are changed forever. Thank you, Mr. President.\n\nDonald Trump (33:07):\n\nAnybody else? Howard, would like to say [inaudible 00:33:14]?\n\nHoward (33:14):\n\nI'm okay.\n\nDonald Trump (33:14):\n\nWas hoping he'd say that. Bobby, come up for a second. What a job you're doing. Say a few words.\n\nSpeaker 1 (33:23):\n\nThank you, Mr. President. Thank you for your vision, your commitment to our country. When my uncle was president, the fertility rate in this country was 3.5%. Today it is 1.6%. The replacement rate, in other words, the fertility that you need in order to keep your population even is 2.1%. We are below replacement right now. That is a national security threat to our country and we know why this is happening. And President Trump is addressing the root causes through his MAHA agenda of reducing endocrine disruptors, the exposure to the chemicals that decrease fertility.\n\n(34:09)Today, the average teenager in this country has 50% of the sperm count, 50% of the testosterone as a 65-year-old man. Our girls are hitting puberty six years earlier and that's bad. But also our parents aren't having children. Parents who want to have children do not have access. I have seven children. I feel that God has blessed me with that and I can't imagine how different my life would be if I did not have that blessing.\n\n(34:42)I want to point out also this morning Harvard University released a study that showed that the obesity rates have now climbed over 70%. And this again is for the same reason, we're flooding our kids, we're poisoning a generation, mass poisoning a generation of kids with chemicals. President Trump has instructed us to stop these problems at the root cause. But he's also recognized that there are people who are injured, people who are not living their life to the fullest and he's addressing that. Last week we made GLP drugs available at most favored nation and this week it's IVF. I want to thank you so much for that, Mr. President.\n\n(35:32)I saw on an airplane the other day you said that you didn't believe that you were going to get to heaven. You're doing God's work here. You made peace in the Middle East, which is beyond anybody's imagination. And now you're giving millions of Americans a chance to have babies. And you're doing this while the government is locked down by the Democrats. But this administration has not stopped working for the American people, and that's because of your energy, your commitment, your vision. And I want to thank you for allowing me to be part of it.\n\nDonald Trump (36:16):\n\nAnd he's doing a great job. And by the way, Kyle is fantastic. [inaudible 00:36:22]. He's got a lot of courage. I wouldn't do that. Howard, you and I would not be good at that. We'd go about 30 miles an hour, but we'd be safe. Anyway. So thank you very much. Any questions, please?\n\nSpeaker 6 (36:36):\n\nMr. President, you posted earlier today-\n\nDonald Trump (36:37):\n\nYeah, please.\n\nSpeaker 2 (36:38):\n\nMr. President, this is a major campaign promise that you made. It was a big hot topic towards the end of the election. You're delivering on that again. I actually had a question for Secretary Kennedy or Dr. Heide. Dr. Heide said something that I thought was really important. You talked about how this coverage option, this benefit option, gives the companies the maximum flexibility to design benefits consistent to their values. I was wondering if either you or the president could expand on that and talk about why that's an important thing to understand about this program.\n\nSpeaker 3 (37:08):\n\nYes, thank you. It's a great question. We think that employers are best situated to know what them and their employees want to contribute to in relation to their benefits. So employers are going to be able to decide how to cover the root causes of infertility, things like obesity, metabolic health, and other things that are impacting infertility. And also if they want to encourage their employees to see certain types of doctors and they can work with providers that are identifying the highest quality fertility providers. And so it puts them in the driver's seat. And our view is that we want employers to be the ones that can make those decisions, not the government. Thank you.\n\nDonald Trump (37:49):\n\nAll right. That's a good answer.\n\nSpeaker 2 (37:49):\n\nIt was a [inaudible 00:37:53]\n\nDonald Trump (37:49):\n\nThat's a very good answer. Yeah, please. Go ahead.\n\nSpeaker 4 (37:55):\n\nMr. President, previously you did not seem to be bothered regarding Hamas cracking down on what you called crack gangs, actually-\n\nDonald Trump (38:08):\n\nA what?\n\nSpeaker 4 (38:08):\n\nCouple of gangs. And today you issued a threat against Hamas on Truth Social. What has changed-\n\nDonald Trump (38:17):\n\nAnd what was said? Go ahead.\n\nSpeaker 4 (38:18):\n\nYou said if they continue keep killing innocents in Gaza, that if that continues, the United States will go after them-\n\nDonald Trump (38:27):\n\nYeah. I know I issues a strong statement. That's right.\n\nSpeaker 4 (38:28):\n\nThey used to be gangs and now you're saying innocents. What made you think they're innocents now?\n\nDonald Trump (38:34):\n\nWell, I'm looking at what's happening and that wasn't the deal that was made. And we'll see what happens. It's calmed down. It's a tough neighborhood, we know that. We have a commitment from them and I assume they're going to honor that commitment. I hope they do. And I understand they brought back some additional bodies today. It's a rough deal when you think of it, right? Very rough. We have our hostages back completely. We were very lucky with that. But it's a tough situation. They brought back bodies today, as you probably know. But they also said they're going to behave. We're going to find out if they behave. If they behave good, if they don't behave, we'll take care of it. Yeah, please.\n\nSpeaker 4 (39:20):\n\nFollowing up on that. When you said-\n\nDonald Trump (39:21):\n\nI didn't say you. You're CNN, fake news. Go ahead.\n\nSpeaker 2 (39:22):\n\nMr. President, you said in your post that if they kept killing people in Gaza, we would have no choice but to go in and kill them. So do you mean US forces would go in and take out Hamas?\n\nDonald Trump (39:35):\n\nI didn't say who would go in, but somebody will go in.\n\nSpeaker 2 (39:37):\n\nWho is leading-\n\nDonald Trump (39:38):\n\nIt's not going to be us. We won't have to. There are people very close, very nearby that will go in. They'll do the trick very easily, but under our auspices.\n\nSpeaker 2 (39:48):\n\nCould I follow up? You also posted about your call with President Putin today. You spoke about meeting in Hungary with him. Do you have a timeline or a date set for when?\n\nDonald Trump (39:55):\n\nI would say within two weeks or so. Pretty quick. Marco Rubio is going to be meeting with his counterpart, as you know, Lavrov. And they'll be meeting pretty soon. They're going to set up a time and a place very shortly. Maybe it's already set up. They've already spoken. And I thought it was a very good phone call. I thought very productive. But I'll be meeting with President Putin and we'll make a determination. Tomorrow I'm meeting with President Zelensky and I'll be telling him about the call.\n\n(40:27)I mean, we have a problem. They don't get along too well, those two. And it's sometimes tough to have meetings. So we may do something where we're separate, but separate but equal. We'll meet and talk parties. But this is a terrible relationship the two of them have, and it's one of those things. I've seen things that nobody would believe, but this is one of them. So I'll be meeting, we're going to be meeting in Hungary. Viktor Orbán is going to be hosting. And it's really something that's time. Last week, over 7,000 people were killed. That's ridiculous. And it doesn't affect our country. We're not losing people. We're not losing… Bobby, we're not losing Americans. But they're losing Russians, Ukrainians, mostly soldiers, for the most part soldiers. And we think we're going to get… We hope we're going to get it stopped. Because of my relationship with President Putin I thought this would be very quick. And it's turned out to be… Who would think I did Middle East before I did this? We did a total of eight now, seven and now eight. And we're going to make this number nine.\n\n(41:40)Yeah, please.\n\nSpeaker 5 (41:43):\n\n[inaudible 00:41:43] you said, you posted that there was great progress. Can you tell us a little bit about that? Was it a shift in Putin's tone? Was it something new he told you? Did he give you any message to give?\n\nDonald Trump (41:53):\n\nYou're talking about the whole-\n\nSpeaker 5 (41:54):\n\n… President Zelensky tomorrow.\n\nDonald Trump (41:56):\n\nIt just seems to me that… Look, it's only a feel. That's all I've done in my whole life. I've made deals. I know about deals. I do it well. I don't think any presidents ever ended a war, frankly. One war. I did eight of them, Maria. Right? But I don't know. Did Bush ever end? Do you think Biden ended a war? Biden started wars because he was stupid. But do you think Biden ended any wars? No. I don't know of anybody that ended wars. I ended eight of them now. It's going to be nine. I think we're going to have this one done hopefully soon. But I'll be meeting him probably over the next two weeks. First Marco is going to be meeting and the Vice President, as you know, is very much involved. The whole team is involved. Steve Witkoff will be involved. Yeah, please.\n\nSpeaker 5 (42:40):\n\nWhat did you tell him about the Tomahawks? Did you discuss the Tomahawk missiles? Did you discuss-\n\nDonald Trump (42:44):\n\nWell, we talked about it a little bit. Didn't say much. But I do say to you, we need Tomahawks for the United States of America too. We have a lot of them, but we need them. I mean, we can't deplete for our country. So they're very vital. They're very powerful. They're very accurate. They're very good. But we need them too. So I don't know what we can do about that.\n\nSpeaker 4 (43:09):\n\nMr. President, why do you think a second meeting with Putin now will yield different results?\n\nDonald Trump (43:16):\n\nWell, I think Alaska actually set a stage, and that wasn't very long ago, but it set a stage. You have to understand, I came into this situation. I didn't start this war. This is a Biden deal. And I came into it and it was a mess. It could have led to World War Three. In my opinion, this could have led to World War Three. That won't happen, but it could have. So I came in, this war was raging. When I left, this wasn't even a thought for four years. Nobody talked about… I spoke to President Putin about Ukraine, it was the apple of his eye. But there was never going to be doing anything like this. And this all went because of some really bad decisions that were made. And look what you have, you have millions of people dead. You have just a horrible, horrible situation. I'm doing it to save souls. That's all I'm doing it for. I'm not doing it for us. We have an ocean between us. I'm doing it also to help Europe. They want to have it ended, but they're unable to do it. I'm able to do it.\n\n(44:15)So I think we'll be successful. We'll save a lot of lives. It should have been done. Should have never started. This would've never happened if the election weren't rigged. This would've never happened. But it did happen, and I'll get it stopped. Yeah. Go ahead.\n\nSpeaker 2 (44:33):\n\nYou mentioned a $1,300 drug at the top of this, were you referring to the weight loss drugs?\n\nDonald Trump (44:38):\n\nI was referring to Ozempic or the fat loss drug.\n\nSpeaker 2 (44:42):\n\nSo those are going to be $150 out of pocket for Americans.\n\nDonald Trump (44:45):\n\nThey'll be much lower. They'll be much lower. Yeah go ahead.\n\nSpeaker 7 (44:49):\n\nWe have not negotiated those yet. We're going to be rolling these out over time. The GOP category of drugs, which includes Ozempic, have not been negotiated yet.\n\nSpeaker 2 (44:57):\n\nWhat's the timeline for that?\n\nDonald Trump (44:58):\n\nBut it will. It'll come down, like everyone\n\nSpeaker 11 (45:00):\n\nOkay. And any timeline on those negotiations?\n\nDonald Trump (45:02):\n\nNo, but I think those are going to come down pretty fast and we do have, I guess some alternatives.\n\nSpeaker 12 (45:07):\n\nThe president will be happy with the result and until he is, we're not going to close those negotiations.\n\nSpeaker 11 (45:11):\n\nThank you.\n\nSpeaker 12 (45:11):\n\nThank you.\n\nDonald Trump (45:12):\n\nExcept it'll happen.\n\nSpeaker 11 (45:13):\n\nGot it.\n\nSpeaker 8 (45:13):\n\nMr. President [inaudible 00:45:15] what's your message to pro-life conservatives. Some pro-life conservatives have religious objections to IVF and are already critical of this policy. What's your message to [inaudible 00:45:23]?\n\nDonald Trump (45:22):\n\nI don't know about the views of that. I'm just looking to do something because pro-life I think this is very pro-life. This is… You can't get more pro-life than this. Please.\n\nSpeaker 9 (45:33):\n\nMr. President, you've been talking about how this new benefit plan will also include root-cause treatments for infertility. How we make sure that those root-cause treatments are equally accessible to IVF.\n\nDonald Trump (45:45):\n\nWell, I think we're going to be doing that. Would you like to… Would anybody like to talk about that subject?\n\nLori Chavez-DeRemer (45:49):\n\nI'll comment on the --\n\nDonald Trump (45:50):\n\nPlease.\n\nLori Chavez-DeRemer (45:50):\n\n… rule making process. I think it's the determination. Again, Secretary of Labor, the determination… The Department of Labor is issuing their intent today to open up the rulemaking process again for more flexibility. Anytime that you have a president who's leading when you can offer more access to healthcare at a lower rate is a benefit to the American people and to the end user and that's exactly what he is doing.\n\n(46:12)And so you heard before that through the Q&A guidance that was issued today with the other agencies, that will give guidance to our employers and the employees about what the flexibility of that is. And then again, opening that rulemaking process for further determination of the access that can be had, offered in those benefits for all different types of healthcare access is the goal of the Department of Labor.\n\nDonald Trump (46:35):\n\nGood answer. That's right.\n\nLori Chavez-DeRemer (46:35):\n\nThank you.\n\nDonald Trump (46:35):\n\nI like this better. Like you said. They can do better than me. Yeah, please.\n\nSpeaker 13 (46:35):\n\nMr. President, do you think --\n\nDonald Trump (46:44):\n\nGood job Lori. You know you're doing a fantastic job.\n\nLori Chavez-DeRemer (46:48):\n\nThank you, Mr. President.\n\nDonald Trump (46:48):\n\nI shouldn't tell. I won't say it, but I will not say that she was recommended by the Teamsters. Can you believe it? And she's turned out to be a gem. An absolute gem. You're doing a great job. Thank you very much.\n\nLori Chavez-DeRemer (47:00):\n\nThank you, Mr. President.\n\nSpeaker 13 (47:01):\n\nMr. President, John Bolton was just indicted --\n\nSpeaker 14 (47:02):\n\nDo you think we can see your deal making skills applied to the government shutdown any time soon?\n\nDonald Trump (47:07):\n\nWell, look, I mean, all we want to do is just extend. We don't want anything. We just want to extend, live with the deal that they had. They want to spend $1.5 trillion on illegal immigrants and they want to destroy healthcare for everyone else. And it's crazy. Crazy. People that are here illegally, they want to spend 1.5 trillion. So we're just not going to do it. No, we have to take care of our healthcare. Now we're doing that today and we're doing it with you favorite nations and most favorite nations. Your costs are going to be dropping greatly. And I'm really good at -- I'm really happy that it's at the beginning of my administration because I did insulin and got it down to like $25, but it doesn't kick in. It didn't kick in for two years by statute, so it couldn't kick in. And I said, \"Boy, I hope I win this election because if I don't, somebody else is going to take credit for it, Bobby.\"\n\n(47:59)And sure as can be, Biden said he didn't even know what the hell was happening and it was a hard thing for me to do. I got insulin way down. What was it before that? It was just massive. It was impossible to afford and sure as can be because it was a statute, it couldn't have been earlier. I said, \"Boy, this falls into the next administration. I better win.\" And all of a sudden I watch this Biden taking credit for something that I did. And on other things too, we had a lot of things kick in. So the nice part about this, this is at the beginning of our administration, so I think we're going to see the fruits of our labor and I hope on our other situation that we've talked so much about, autism, I hope we're going to see some very good results based on the recommendations that we made and we have time to watch those results.\n\nSpeaker 13 (48:51):\n\nMr. President John Bolton was just indicted by a grand jury in Maryland. Do you have a reaction to that?\n\nDonald Trump (48:55):\n\nI didn't know that. You told me for the first time, but I think he's a bad person. I think he's a bad guy. Yeah, he's a bad guy. It's too bad, but it's the way it goes.\n\nSpeaker 13 (49:06):\n\nHave you reviewed the case against him?\n\nDonald Trump (49:08):\n\nThat's the way it goes, right? That's the way it goes. Will I what?\n\nSpeaker 13 (49:11):\n\nHave you reviewed the case against him?\n\nDonald Trump (49:12):\n\nNo, I haven't. I haven't, but I just think he's a bad person. Okay. Anybody else?\n\nSpeaker 11 (49:16):\n\nWhat's the timeline for the IVF drug through the National Commissioner Priority review, Doctor. Dr. Makary.\n\nDonald Trump (49:22):\n\nWhat do you think, Doctor?\n\nDr. Makary (49:24):\n\nSo first of all, the National Priority Voucher Program says we're going to proactively at the FDA look for amazing treatments like this IVF treatment. We're going to reach out to the companies and if it's in line with the president's national priorities, we're going to put those drugs at the front of the line and get a decision out in weeks instead of a year. And so today we announced nine drugs that are going to be recipients. These are products where the manufacturing is going to be in the United States, or it's meeting a large unmet public health need, like a diabetes drug we announced today. Or it is a product where you're going to see an affordability phenomenon because the prices are getting equalized in line with the president's most favorite nation status goal.\n\nDonald Trump (50:12):\n\nWow. That's good. Why didn't I have him speaking so could have saved a lot of time. Thanks. I'm not surprised. Yeah, please.\n\nSpeaker 10 (50:19):\n\nYes, yes. Thank you. So Senate majority leader, John Thune, today said he'd like to proceed with the bill, which would put sanctions on Russia. What's your thought on that?\n\nDonald Trump (50:30):\n\nWell, we're going to see. He doesn't know about the call yet. I'm going to speak to him later. And it was subject to what I wanted to do. And so we'll see what happens. We may have… This may be such a productive call that we're going to end up… We want to get peace. We want to stop the killing. 7,000 people a week. Can you believe it? We want to stop the killing. So I'm going to speak to him and the speaker, Mike Johnson. I'll speak to them a little bit later and I'll tell them about this and we'll make the right determination. I'm not against anything. I'm just saying it may not be perfect timing.\n\nSpeaker 10 (51:08):\n\nBut --\n\nDonald Trump (51:08):\n\nIt could happen in a week or two, but it's at my option, as you know.\n\nSpeaker 10 (51:12):\n\nRight but did President Putin try to dissuade you from selling Tomahawks missiles?\n\nDonald Trump (51:18):\n\nWell, what do you think he's going to say? Please sell Tomahawks.\n\nSpeaker 10 (51:21):\n\nBut didn't he --\n\nDonald Trump (51:21):\n\nIs he going to say, \"Please sell those Tomahawks. I really appreciate it.\" I did actually say, \"Would you mind if I gave a couple of thousand Tomahawks to your opposition?\" I did say that to him. I said it just that way. He didn't like the idea. He really didn't like the idea. No, I said it that way. You have to be a little bit lighthearted sometimes. But no, he doesn't want… Tomahawk is a vicious weapon. It's a vicious, offensive, incredibly destructive weapon. Nobody wants Tomahawks shot at them.\n\nSpeaker 8 (51:55):\n\nDid he specifically ask you not to provide Tomahawks?\n\nDonald Trump (51:58):\n\nWouldn't anybody? I mean, it's been in the news. Who wouldn't do that? CNN. Who wouldn't do that? You think he's going to say --\n\nSpeaker 10 (52:06):\n\nYou think it will help end the war?\n\nDonald Trump (52:07):\n\n… I'd love to have Tomahawks sent my way. I don't think so. Maria, we have one of the great stars of television here, and she's an incredible person and she's just an amazing woman who… She got it all right. She got the Russia, Russia, Russia hoax right. She got everything. Would you have a question?\n\nSpeaker 15 (52:23):\n\nYes, Mr. President, I would ask you why this was so important to you, IVF. And why was autism so important to you? What are you trying to achieve?\n\nDonald Trump (52:33):\n\nWell, autism is like a whole different thing. When you look at… It was one in 20,000, now it's one in 12. If you look, Bobby, we have different numbers, but one in 12, one in 28, 1 in 32. There's a couple of different numbers out there, but it's one in a very, very different number than it used to be. It used to be one in 20,000, and that was not that long ago, 20 years ago or so. And now they had something for boys, for babies, baby boys. It's one in 12. I heard one in 10, Bobby, I heard another one, you know, different lists but when you think of that, it's not even sustainable, but there's something artificial.\n\n(53:16)When that happens that's not like a natural. And then you have certain groups of people that literally don't have autism and they're not taking some of the things that we're taking. So we're working very hard. And on IVF, it's just that I have friends including Katie that called me and they told me the importance of it. I wasn't that familiar with it. Now I think I've sort of become the father ever since I heard. There was a bad decision in Alabama where a judge wanted all clinics to be immediately closed, right. And Katie called up and you said you were pretty strongly attacked by your friends that you didn't even know were involved with IVF, right?\n\nKatie Britt (53:52):\n\nWe had people that had grandkids, people who'd gone through IVF themselves telling their story and saying, there are people who cope out there.\n\nDonald Trump (54:01):\n\nTell what you did when you heard from your friends. You said this was not… They almost became violent, right?\n\nKatie Britt (54:06):\n\nYeah. I told him, I said, \"Mr. President, we need you. We need your voice in this conversation. We need the directive. We need the strong support because there are millions of people out there, moms and dads, wanting to bring life into the world.\" And you had people, the chilling effect that occurred across Alabama. There were people that were in the middle of that process that had been praying to have a child, and that was halted. And so the reality of that was very stark in our state. And so I was able to tell the president some of the stories of people, friends and grandparents and relatives that told me what they had experienced and also what they were fearful of in the future. And the president very quickly acted, spoke with a strong voice and really led the way. Obviously, we saw Democrats continue to fearmonger for the remainder of the year trying to use it as an election issue when actually IVF is legal and accessible in all 50 states.\n\n(55:07)And President Trump very clearly said where he was on this. And he said, \"I'm going to make sure that this is more accessible and that is more affordable for families coast to coast.\" That's exactly what he did. But it's that real life… There's real life stories, sir, that he responded to. And that's what people don't know about him. He cares. And when you tell him what American people are dealing with, he wants to do something about it. You have leaders and politicians that come before him. They want to talk about things. President Trump wants to actually make things happen. That's exactly what he did here. And I am so, so grateful. Mr. President.\n\nDonald Trump (55:45):\n\nThank you Katie very much. Appreciate it. So we will go back to what we're doing, working again with Marco and with JD and a few of the people on the war and we're doing a lot of other things also. The economy is unbelievable. It really is. It's been incredible. And I think one of the great numbers that I've ever heard, think of it over $17 trillion being invested in our country. And when you compare that to the last administration, but really compare it to any administration, compare it to any country that's never been a country with anything like that. That's in a period of eight months. And we've already broken every record, possibly. There's never anything even close. So we'll go back to all of that. Prices are down, oil is down. We're down $58 a barrel. We're going to be hitting $2 for gasoline.\n\n(56:39)I think we're going to be at $2 and the previous administration, they were at four and $5. They were going up much higher. And then they swung back into my things, but they didn't swing back properly. They were very, very late. They really blew it. We had it really going in the right direction. They came and took everything out. And it's incredible. I'll never forget, they lost control of the price of gasoline, of oil. They totally lost control, Howard. And then they went back immediately, \"Well, let's go back to Trump.\" But by that time it was too late. And they didn't go back because the leases and everything else, they didn't do what they had to do. They really didn't know how to. But we could be hitting close to $2 a gallon. I'd love to break it if we could, but we could be… And, you know, when that comes down, everything else, and everything else has been coming down. Groceries are down, the price of things are down.\n\n(57:36)And honestly, the simplicity is if you can get oil down, it's such a big category everything follows. So just about everything follows. And we are working on beef, and I think we have a deal on beef that's going to bring the price of beef. That would be the one product that we would say is a little bit higher than we want it, maybe higher than we want it. And that's going to be coming down pretty soon too. We did something. We worked on magic, but groceries are down and energy is down, electricity is way down. We have the prices coming down for people. They were abused for four years by the Biden administration. Thank you very much, everybody. We'll see you soon. Thank you.\n\nAudience (58:18):\n\n[inaudible 00:58:18] changes to the IRS.\n\nKatie Britt (58:18):\n\nThank you press. Let's go. All right you guys. Thank you. Thank you guys. Thank you guys. Thank you guys. Thank you press. Thank you. Thank you guys. Thank you.\n\nDonald Trump (58:18):\n\n[inaudible 00:58:35]",

    "date": "",
    "transcript": "Donald Trump (00:00):\n\n… as you were running and even before you were running because as a tremendously talented economist, you were getting a lot of good write-ups and I appreciated that. But he was make Argentina great again. It worked. I actually sent him some hats for his early part of the campaign and then he called me. He wanted a lot more. I said, \"When does it stop? When will it stop?\" It stopped with him winning.\n\n(00:25)He's become very popular. He's on the verge of a breakthrough. I think he's really on the verge of tremendous economic success. I know that Scott Bessent is helping. And our great Scott is doing a job and he feels very strongly about it. Scott, do you want to say just a couple of words about that please?\n\nScott Bessent (00:45):\n\nYes, sir. The president is fighting 100 years of bad economic history and policy and is-\n\nDonald Trump (00:53):\n\nBoth presidents.\n\nScott Bessent (00:54):\n\nBoth, we're fighting.\n\nDonald Trump (00:58):\n\nI thought he was talking about the US president, what he said.\n\nScott Bessent (01:03):\n\nAnd there's a midterm election coming up. We think he's going to do quite well and then continue his reform agenda. Mr. President, as you said, president Obama had a big opportunity during his term, which he wasted.\n\n(01:22)Many governments in Latin America went center-right, and the US ignored them. We are not going to ignore our allies. It is economic strength. We're using our economic strength to create peace just as you've done all over the world. And it is much better to form an economic bridge with our allies, people who want to do the right thing than have to have shoot a narco gunboats.\n\n(01:49)So we think that this is an opportunity for the Argentinian people and that President Milei is the one to do it. He's got a great cabinet, he's got a great team who we've worked with over the past weeks.\n\nDonald Trump (02:03):\n\nAnd the election is coming up very soon and it's a very big election being watched by the world because he's done an incredible job. But with that comes some pain. And they have some pain and now they're coming out of it. I think the victory is very important. Your poll numbers I hear are pretty good, but I think they'll be better after this.\n\n(02:24)And our approvals are somewhat subject to who wins the election because if a socialist, or in the case of New York City, a communist wins, you feel a lot differently about making an investment. I think, Scott, you'd feel that if somebody that had no chance, in other words, if somebody wins and has no chance of ever having a great economy because of that philosophy, you would put a halt to what we're doing.\n\nScott Bessent (02:51):\n\nYes, sir. And we're confident the President Milei is going to do well. We've been criticized by a couple of American peronists like Senator Warren. And she-\n\nDonald Trump (03:06):\n\nAnd it's a compliment. She has no idea what she's doing. She's a nasty, horrible senator. Go ahead. Other than that, I like her very much.\n\nScott Bessent (03:16):\n\nYeah. And she and her protege in New York, Mandami, who I don't even think he's a peronist, I think he's more of the-\n\nDonald Trump (03:23):\n\nCommunist.\n\nScott Bessent (03:24):\n\n… Communist Shava Misamo. So we stand with the President and what he stands for in the hope for the Argentinian people. And President Trump, just like you, he carries the young people. So it's hope for the future. The Argentines have made the decision to shake off 100 years of bad policy. They went from one of the richest countries in the world to a ton of debt. And I think that with the bridge the US is giving them and the strong policies, that Argentina can be great again.\n\nDonald Trump (04:03):\n\nThank you very much. Please go ahead, please.\n\nPresident Milei (04:04):\n\n[foreign language 00:04:11].\n\nDonald Trump (06:13):\n\nThank you. Thank you very much. Do we have a interpreter that wants to… You all either have that, has everyone understood? Because I think you made a very important profound statement actually, but we could have it interpreted if you want. Does anybody want an interpreter? Would you like that? Would you like it? Can the interpreter speak? What? Do we have somebody set up for that if you want?\n\nSpeaker 1 (06:38):\n\nIt's actually simultaneous. So if the president would like to repeat his statement, we can do it.\n\nDonald Trump (06:44):\n\nNo, that's okay. Don't worry about it. We'll leave it that way. So it's an honor to have you here. And I just want to tell you that your career has been an amazing one and it's going to continue with the election. You're going to win the election, we're going to endorse you. I'm going to endorse you today, fully endorse you. And people in Argentina like me. A lot of people like me. I'm even surprised myself, but we had a great week, we had a great weekend, we had a great period of time in the Middle East. It was very comprehensive. It went very rapidly and I think it's going to lead to something that's going to be unrecognizable, certainly for the Middle East.\n\n(07:25)What's taken place in the last few days, people can't believe it. I've never seen anything like it. I've never seen the love and the spirit. And I've done a lot of things. I've done a lot of deals. I've done a lot of political deals where countries come into line or whatever, but I've never seen anything like this, the level of love.\n\n(07:40)And it has to do with the mystique of the Middle East I think because if I did other countries, I did. I did seven other settlements of wars, complete settlements of wars and it was very well received. But this is something I've never seen anything like it. The media covered it very fairly. And even the fake news, of which we have a lot, they actually covered it fairly for a change. And I appreciated that. We have to get back to that. It's so important.\n\n(08:08)But I just want to say it's a pleasure to be with you and we're going to have lunch. And we'll take a couple of questions from the news and I'm sure they'll be extremely non-hostile and friendly. JD went through a very friendly interview with George Slapidopoulos, who is nice enough to pay me $16 million. The last time we came, he had to pay $16 million to me, which was good. It was worth having somebody lie. If you get $16 million, that's good.\n\n(08:37)But JD had a very nasty person interviewing him and we can't let that happen. Just as inappropriate to cut off a highly respected Vice President of the United States mid-sentence. I guess it's one way to win an argument. That was the only way he was going to win the argument. So it was pretty inappropriate, I want to tell you that. So thank you very much. Do you have something there?\n\nPresident Milei (09:00):\n\nYes.\n\nDonald Trump (09:01):\n\nOh, good. Thank you.\n\nPresident Milei (09:01):\n\n[foreign language 00:09:02].\n\nDonald Trump (09:01):\n\nI'll get it. That's fantastic. Thank you very much.\n\nSpeaker 2 (09:20):\n\nWhen he did this letter, Mr. President, your settlement in the Middle East wasn't done. So we have to do a new letter-\n\nDonald Trump (09:28):\n\nLet's do that.\n\nSpeaker 2 (09:28):\n\n… to include that because this is a very important-\n\nDonald Trump (09:32):\n\nYou'll have to add one extra sentence.\n\nSpeaker 2 (09:34):\n\nExactly.\n\nDonald Trump (09:36):\n\nThat's good. Thank you very much. This is a great-\n\nSpeaker 2 (09:38):\n\nYou're very welcome.\n\nDonald Trump (09:40):\n\n… such a beautiful statement. Thank you very much.\n\nSpeaker 2 (09:48):\n\nYou're welcome.\n\nDonald Trump (09:48):\n\nThat's beautiful. Thank you.\n\nPress (09:49):\n\nMr. President.\n\n(09:49)Mr. President.\n\n(09:49)Mr. President.\n\n(09:49)Mr. President.\n\n(09:52)Mr. President.\n\nDonald Trump (09:53):\n\nWhy don't we talk about Argentina first and how is Argentina going?\n\nSpeaker 3 (10:02):\n\nAre you worried about the influence of China in Argentina? Sorry.\n\nDonald Trump (10:02):\n\nGo ahead.\n\nSpeaker 4 (10:03):\n\nHow is this Argentina rescue package America First? And is this rescue package meant to help President Milei's party in the coming election?\n\nDonald Trump (10:12):\n\nNo, it's really meant to help a good financial philosophy where Argentina can, after 20 years of disaster… Because it was very successful at one point and it can be again like Venezuela. Venezuela was very, very successful and now it's a dictatorship. So when we can help our neighbors, yeah, we're making tremendous progress in South America. South America, Marco was telling me. He's our great expert here, he really knows it, but you were telling me that so many of the countries are coming our way.\n\n(10:49)And a few years ago when I just came back, so I've been here now almost nine months, but when I just came in I was amazed to see how poorly we've done. We lost so many. And one of them was Argentina, would be lost if he wasn't there. And I think he will be there because the people recognize he's done an amazing job. He took over a real mess. So did I take over a mess. I took over a mess by the Biden group. And Obama was, he started it. I'll tell you. Barack Hussein Obama started it. Could you give a couple of words on South America? You were telling me so well yesterday how well we're doing. Go ahead.\n\nSpeaker 5 (11:27):\n\nWell, first of all, we have now eight or nine, 10 countries, Argentina being foremost among them, that have aligned with the United States on issue after issue in international community events all over the world. In fact, these great allies like Argentina, but I can go into others. Costa Rica, I don't want to leave anybody out, El Salvador.\n\n(11:44)But I think one of the more promising developments is later this month there'll be an election in Bolivia after 25, 30 years of anti-American hostile government. Both of the candidates running in that election in the runoff election want strong and better relations with the United States and another transformative opportunity there. But so I think this is important. This is our hemisphere. It's where we live, and having strong neighbors such as this-\n\nDonald Trump (12:11):\n\nAnd great progress has been made really-\n\nSpeaker 5 (12:13):\n\nAnd we'll make more, absolutely.\n\nDonald Trump (12:14):\n\n… over the last nine months. Really over the last nine months. Yeah, please.\n\nSpeaker 6 (12:21):\n\nMr. President from Argentina, Buenos Aires. Do you imagine soon a free trade agreement with Argentina? Could it be possible soon?\n\nDonald Trump (12:26):\n\nYeah, it will be. Well, we're going to discuss some of it today, but know we want to help Argentina. And we want to always help ourselves, but we want to help Argentina. And one of the ways we can do, they have great product and we used to do a lot of trade. And then if you look at what the Democrats, well, they didn't know. They didn't know, honestly, they didn't know what they were doing but a lot of that trade disappeared. And they have great product. So we will be trading with Argentina. And that'll be helpful to them and it's good for us also.\n\nSpeaker 7 (12:55):\n\nMr. President, was China trying to draw a wedge between the US and Argentina by buying soybeans from Argentina and not US farmers?\n\nDonald Trump (13:01):\n\nI would say so.\n\nSpeaker 7 (13:02):\n\nAnd China on port fees.\n\nDonald Trump (13:02):\n\nChina likes to draw a wedge.\n\nSpeaker 7 (13:03):\n\nThe placed port fees on US ships too.\n\nDonald Trump (13:07):\n\nYeah, sure. I mean I guess that's natural. It's China and it's natural, but it's not going to mean anything in the end.\n\nPress (13:17):\n\nMr. President, Mr. President.\n\nSpeaker 8 (13:24):\n\n[inaudible 00:13:20] from Cantina. Should Argentina end the China swap and close the space base in Neuquén?\n\nDonald Trump (13:26):\n\nI don't think you should be doing business much with… You can do some trade, but you certainly shouldn't be doing beyond that. Certainly shouldn't be doing anything having to do with the military, with China. And if that's what's happening, I'd be very upset about that. Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 8 (13:41):\n\nI mean what about the swap?\n\nDonald Trump (13:42):\n\nYou understand that, Scott, right? You do understand?\n\nSpeaker 8 (13:48):\n\nMr. President, Mr. President, what about the swap because it's so important for Argentina, the swap?\n\nDonald Trump (13:49):\n\nGo ahead.\n\nSpeaker 8 (13:49):\n\nThe central one.\n\nScott Bessent (13:52):\n\nThe American assistance is not predicated on the swap with China being closed. Any reporting to that\n\nScott Bessent (14:00):\n\nEffect is incorrect.\n\nSpeaker 9 (14:01):\n\nBut you said, sorry, but you said that Argentina has to expose China from your business or from your agenda and the swap is so important to Argentina.\n\nScott Bessent (14:13):\n\nNo, I was referring more to ports, military bases, observation facilities that have been created in Argentina.\n\nSpeaker 9 (14:23):\n\nThan the swap? More than the swap?\n\nScott Bessent (14:27):\n\nMore than the swap.\n\nDonald Trump (14:29):\n\nHe was referring to that? Yeah, behind you please.\n\nSpeaker 10 (14:31):\n\nYes, President. For Argentina, what's the benefit for United States in helping this way, Argentina?\n\nDonald Trump (14:38):\n\nJust helping a great philosophy take over a great country. Argentina is one of the most beautiful countries that I've ever seen, and we want to see it succeed. Very simple. We don't have to do it. It's not going to make a big difference for our country, but it will in terms of South America, if Argentina does well, you're going to have others following, and a lot of others are following. You have countries in South America that, two years ago, would've never even been thought of to go as democracies or as just countries that want to do fair and balanced trading. And now all, you mentioned Bolivia, but there are numerous other countries that are coming our way. And Brazil, as you know, I had a very good conversation with the President. I met him at the United Nations before I went up to speak, and then I found that I didn't have a speech because I had no teleprompter. They turned off my teleprompter purposely. They made it impossible for me, but it didn't silence me. I spoke without and it was a good speech. It was good speech.\n\n(15:44)But no, think of that. You go into the United Nations, I'm speaking in front of 158 leaders and the whole world, and I look at my teleprompter and it's dead. They killed my teleprompter. They wouldn't let the man that operated into the booth. Can you believe that?\n\nSpeaker 11 (16:01):\n\nYou don't have any specific interest in economic terms for the state?\n\nDonald Trump (16:06):\n\nI do have no. I want to see it succeed. I think it's going to be great and we will benefit also, but it's not that big a benefit because it's not that big a country, but it's a very important country and it's a country that can be very successful. There are some countries that will never be successful. This is a country that has great potential, if it has the right leadership, and you have the right leadership with this man right here.\n\nSpeaker 12 (16:32):\n\nMr. President, would you support Dollarization?\n\nDonald Trump (16:35):\n\nI would say that I'll leave that up to my economic people, but I like the dollar, I'm very strong on the dollar, and anybody who wants to deal in dollars, they have an advantage over people that aren't. But for the most part, we're keeping it that way. I think if Biden and that group would've gotten elected, meaning Kamala, you wouldn't have the dollar as your currency anymore. You wouldn't have a world domination by the dollar if I didn't win this election.\n\n(17:06)And now the domination, like bricks, I told anybody wants to be in bricks, that's fine, but we're going to put tariffs on your nation. Everybody dropped out. They're all dropping out of bricks. Bricks was an attack on the dollar and I said, \"You want to play that game? I'm going to put tariffs on all of your product coming into the US.\" They said, \"Like I said, we're dropping out of bricks.\" And bricks is like they don't even talk about it anymore. Scott, do you want to answer that, please?\n\nScott Bessent (17:35):\n\nWe're very happy with the current currency arrangement.\n\nDonald Trump (17:42):\n\nYou're ABC fake news, I don't want. Go ahead, Brian.\n\nBrian (17:45):\n\nFirst of all, congratulations.\n\nDonald Trump (17:47):\n\nI don't take questions from ABC Fake news after what you did with Stephanopoulos to the Vice President of the United States, I don't take questions from ABC Fake news. Brian, go ahead.\n\nBrian (17:57):\n\nYes, sir. First of all, congratulations on achieving peace. You are indeed the peacemaker. On a lighter note-\n\nDonald Trump (18:04):\n\nDid you ever think I was going to be called the peacemaker?\n\nBrian (18:06):\n\nActually, I did. I saw some of the actors you were.\n\nDonald Trump (18:08):\n\nI did, too. Go ahead.\n\nBrian (18:09):\n\nBut on a lighter note, Alyssa Farah, she is one of the hosts on ABC's Show, The View. She said a while back, I'll quote, \"If Trump gets the Israeli hostages out, I promise I will wear a MAGA hat for one day on this show and say, \"Thank you for doing it.\" Your response?\n\nDonald Trump (18:27):\n\nWell, did she put the hat on?\n\nBrian (18:28):\n\nWell, she hasn't got the hat, yet.\n\nDonald Trump (18:30):\n\nWho is it? Which one?\n\nBrian (18:31):\n\nAlyssa Farah.\n\nDonald Trump (18:33):\n\nWell, she used to work for me. So she used to work here. I'll tell you about Alyssa. She worked here. She gave me the most beautiful letter when the administration, the time came up, the election was rigged. I left. She gave me the most beautiful letter you've ever seen. I was a great President. What a great job. Some of the letters have been quoted. This is Alyssa, who I never thought was very outstanding. I figured she would not make it, and she didn't have a big role here, either. And then we had January 6th and she left after that or before that. But she gave me the most beautiful letters. And then even months after she left, and while we weren't here any longer, she sent another letter, glowing letter, beautiful letter. And then she got hired by The View and they gave her a couple of bucks and she changed her view very quickly. I never thought she'd make it, never thought she had what it took in any way, you know what that means. But she's on The View.\n\n(19:34)But it just shows what a fraud The View is because this woman gave me letters and statements. She said I was the greatest President in her lifetime. Now she's not that old, so I didn't consider it a great compliment, but I've had better.\n\nBrian (19:47):\n\nCan we send her a hat?\n\nDonald Trump (19:48):\n\nMore recently, I've had the greatest President of them all. I like that much better. Does that include Washington and Lincoln? Yes, sir, it does. I said I like that person. So I think she's a total, I think she's a joke.\n\nSpeaker 13 (20:06):\n\nMr. President, on Gaza, how long will it take Hamas to disarm, and can you guarantee that is going to happen?\n\nDonald Trump (20:10):\n\nWell, they're going to disarm and because they said they were going to disarm, and if they don't disarm, we will disarm them.\n\nSpeaker 13 (20:16):\n\nHow will you do that?\n\nDonald Trump (20:17):\n\nI don't have to explain that to you, but if they don't disarm, we will disarm them. They know I'm not playing games. Now we did something monumental. We got the hostages back. That was the first thing we had to do above all else, get the hostages back. Now they misrepresented because we were told they had 26, 24 of dead hostages, if we can use those terms, and it seems as though they don't have that because we're talking about a much lesser number, but that's a very tough subject. I want them back. That's what they said. I want them back, also.\n\n(20:56)They said they were going to disarm. And initially speaking, they needed… They did take out a couple of gangs that were very bad, very, very bad gangs. And they did take them out and they killed a number of gang members and that didn't bother me much, to be honest with you. That's okay. We had a couple of very bad gangs. It's no different than other countries like Venezuela sent their gangs into us and we took care of those gangs. We have Washington D.C. is one of the safest cities in the country. It was one of the worst cities in the country if you go back just a little while ago, right now, it's safe. You can walk to work. Isn't it nice? But we have told them we want disarm and they will disarm. And if they don't disarm, we will disarm them and it'll happen quickly and, perhaps, violently.\n\nSpeaker 13 (21:46):\n\nYou say-\n\nDonald Trump (21:47):\n\nBut they will disarm. Do you understand me?\n\nSpeaker 13 (21:48):\n\nYes. You say-\n\nDonald Trump (21:49):\n\nBecause you always, everyone says, \"Well they won't disarm.\" They will disarm. And I spoke to Hamas and I said, \"You're going to disarm, right?\" \"Yes, sir. We're going to disarm.\" That's what they told me. They will disarm or we will disarm them. Got it? Okay. Next.\n\nSpeaker 13 (22:06):\n\nWhat is the deadline for that? You say quickly. Sir, you say quickly, but what is the deadline you're going to put on that before you take action.\n\nDonald Trump (22:11):\n\nA reasonable period of time. Pretty quickly. A reasonable period of time.\n\nSpeaker 14 (22:15):\n\nCongratulations on the piece you achieved in the Middle East, first of all.\n\nDonald Trump (22:18):\n\nThank you very much.\n\nSpeaker 14 (22:19):\n\nAnd my question is regarding Argentina. Does continue-\n\nDonald Trump (22:22):\n\nAre you from Argentina?\n\nSpeaker 14 (22:23):\n\nI'm from Argentina, yes.\n\nDonald Trump (22:24):\n\nI like the Argentina. I like them much better than ABC. Than ABC Fake news.\n\nSpeaker 15 (22:31):\n\nMe too, sir.\n\nDonald Trump (22:32):\n\nYes, go ahead.\n\nSpeaker 15 (22:32):\n\nDoes continued U.S. support for Argentina depend on the results of the upcoming legislative elections and the ability of the government to pass long-lasting reforms through Congress?\n\nDonald Trump (22:43):\n\nWell, I think if they don't do that, we're not going to be around very long. Scott, can you handle that one, please?\n\nScott Bessent (22:49):\n\nWe're confident that the President's party will, and the coalition will do well in the election. And this aid is predicated on robust policies. And going back to the failed Peronist policies, would cause a U.S. rethink.\n\nSpeaker 14 (23:08):\n\nThank you very much.\n\nDonald Trump (23:09):\n\nIt's a great question. It's a little like New York, you are reading in Argentina about New York. We have a problem. We have a communist who's 33 years old, doesn't know a damned thing. Practically, he's never worked a day in his life, and he caught on, all right? And I'm not going to send a lot of money to New York. I don't have to. The money comes all through the White House. And if they're going to be sending us stupid policies, communist policies, which has proven for thousands of years doesn't work. We don't have to prove it again.\n\n(23:41)We're not going to ruin one of our great cities because we'll make that great. We will clean up the crime in about 30 days. Took 12 days to do Washington, D.C., so New York is bigger. And Chicago, we've already made a lot of progress despite fighting from the government. But Chicago is doing great. Memphis is doing really great. We have great support there from the political leaders. They said, \"Please come in and clean up crime.\" And we love it. We've, in one week, Memphis is so good, it's so much better. We'll have it within a month, we'll have that into a safe city again. And all of these cities, we want to clean them up. We don't like that opposition.\n\n(24:19)But if somebody's going to be a communist mayor of New York, it's a fluke if he gets in, there are a lot of failed people that he is running against. We have failed if you have inferior candidates or something because it's impossible to think that New York City can have a communist mayor. He's a communist. He's not a socialist, by the way. There's a big difference. He's a communist. He's down and dirty. He's a communist. He hates police. He wants to get rid of all police. How can a policeman? He hates Jewish people and yet, he's got Jewish people supporting, hates Jewish people.\n\n(24:52)So it comes through the White House, the funding for New York and for every place comes through the White House. And I'm very generous and I was always very generous with New York, even when you had opposition there. But I was always very generous. But I wouldn't be generous to a communist, a guy that's going to take the money and throw it out the window because you're talking about hundreds of billions of dollars. And we're not going to let somebody get into office and squander the taxpayer money from this country. We're not going to let it happen. So it's a little bit like that with.\n\n(25:24)If you take a look, Argentina, if the president doesn't win, I know the person that he'd be running against, I believe, probably, we probably have the person, the person is extremely far left, and a philosophy that got Argentina into this problem in the first place. So we would not be generous with Argentina if that happened. If he loses, we are not going to be generous with Argentina.\n\nSpeaker 16 (25:49):\n\nMr. President, you talk the Argentina important in the Latin American. What is your plan for Venezuela? But is the terrorism, the narco-terrorism and the President Maduro? What is your plan about it?\n\nDonald Trump (26:04):\n\nWell, Venezuela's done a couple of things very badly. Number one, we get drugs and all of that, but we get something in a way worse because they're a big purveyor of drugs. But we have worse. What they do very well is they send their criminals into the United States and they send Tren de Aragua, you know that very well, you're from Venezuela, I assume. And they send them in by the thousands, literally. And these are the worst of all. And they empty their prisons into the United States. They empty their mental institutions into the United States. And because we had a president who's low IQ, he didn't realize what was going on. And the people that are high IQ that surround him, but they happened to be lunatics, radical left. They're highly intelligent, radical left lunatics. Okay? So in a way, that's worse than having a guy like Biden. But they ran the show.\n\n(26:55)You heard about the autopen, the person that really operated the autopen. But it was really the people that told the person that operated the auto pen what to do. Those are the people that really were president. So we're not going to stand for it in this country. And by the way, that autopen thing is under serious investigation. I don't think you care because you're from Washington. You couldn't care less about that. But I just want to say, because I do the weave, the weave, cover a lot of different subjects. But the people that are involved in that autopen scam, because he barely signed anything. This guy, I don't know how you can be president, he barely signed it. But the only thing we can find for sure is that he signed Hunter's Piden, his pardon. Hunter's Piden, I like that. That's a good combination.\n\n(27:46)So we are going to work very much with the president. We think he's going to win. He should win. And if he does win, we're going to be very helpful. And if he doesn't win, we're not going to waste our time because you have somebody\n\nDonald Trump (28:00):\n\n… whose philosophy has no chance of making Argentina great again.\n\nSpeaker 18 (28:03):\n\nWhat's your advice-\n\nSpeaker 17 (28:03):\n\nMr. President, [inaudible 00:28:06].\n\nDonald Trump (28:03):\n\nGo ahead, Steve.\n\nSpeaker 18 (28:09):\n\nWhat's your advice for-\n\nSteve (28:09):\n\nJust to check something, you said Hamas assured you that they would disarm. Was that a direct conversation or through Mr. Witkoff?\n\nDonald Trump (28:16):\n\nThrough my people, at the highest level.\n\nSpeaker 18 (28:19):\n\nWhat's your advice-\n\nDonald Trump (28:19):\n\nAnd it was meant for him.\n\nSpeaker 18 (28:19):\n\nWhat's your advice for President Milei and Argentina as a political leader?\n\nDonald Trump (28:26):\n\nMy advice is to hold strong to his principles because he's right and he's proving that he was right. He's got one problem. He's got people that are giving him tremendously bad press, even though they know it's wrong. He's got to hold true to his principles because he's going to win. He's going to win. He's doing the right thing. Everybody knows he's doing the right thing, but you have a radical left, sick culture that's a very dangerous group of people, and they're trying to make him look bad. I believe he's going to win out.\n\nSpeaker 18 (29:00):\n\n[inaudible 00:29:00].\n\nSpeaker 17 (29:00):\n\nMr. President, are you saying that-\n\nDonald Trump (29:01):\n\nChina?\n\nSpeaker 18 (29:01):\n\nThe Chinese [inaudible 00:29:06].\n\nDonald Trump (29:05):\n\nWell, you have to be careful with China. Everybody deals with China. They have to deal with us too. You have to be careful with China. Look, I have a great relationship with President Xi, but sometimes it gets testy because China likes to take advantage of people and they can't take advantage of us. But we have a fair relationship with China and I think it'll be fine. And if it's not, that's okay too. You have to do and go where the punches are thrown. You got to put up the blocks. We have a lot of punches being thrown and we've been very successful. I think we're the most successful we've ever been as a country. We have now close, I've been saying 17, we have, I think close to, or maybe even exceeding $18 trillion going to be invested in the United States. That's more money than ever invested in any country before.\n\n(29:57)Even countries with much bigger populations like India or China, nobody's ever had $18 trillion invested in the country. And that's because of November 5th election, because I won. If Xi won, you'd be negative. You'd have people getting out of the country. This country would've been in a major depression. If Xi won, we would've been 1929. They'd like to see that anyway, that's why they keep the government close. They have a shutdown based on nonsense. Think of it, they want to give away $1.5 trillion to people that come into the country illegally. And as you know, the borders now are closed. But when they hear that they get the greatest healthcare package in the world and they have no money, but they're living okay in another country, they head up and they start forming caravans and they try and come into our country.\n\n(30:56)But the big problem is they want to give healthcare to people that should not get healthcare. They want to give healthcare to illegal immigrants by the millions. Look at Gavin Newsom, what he's done, he is ruined California. He gives healthcare to anybody. And I guess they do it for votes. I actually think it's bad politics, but I guess they do it for votes. So I'm with this man because his philosophy is correct, and he may win and he may not win, but I think he's going to win. And if he wins, we're staying with him. And if he doesn't win, we're gone.\n\nSpeaker 22 (31:34):\n\nHow can Argentina help to the Middle East peace process?\n\nDonald Trump (31:42):\n\nThey could help by doing well. If Argentina does well, that's helpful because they know we help Argentina. So if Argentina is successful, that's great because they view us as somebody that helped Argentina and they did well, and the United States maybe will help them and they're going to do well. So the success of Argentina would be a great feather in the cap of the USA because we're helping them, right? Do you understand?\n\nSpeaker 22 (32:09):\n\nYeah. [inaudible 00:32:09].\n\nDonald Trump (32:09):\n\nPlease behind you.\n\nSpeaker 19 (32:09):\n\nThank you, Mr. President. Last week you said that NATO should consider expelling Spain.\n\nDonald Trump (32:16):\n\nWhat?\n\nSpeaker 19 (32:17):\n\nYou said that NATO should consider expelling Spain. Would you support that?\n\nDonald Trump (32:18):\n\nWhat to do with Spain?\n\nSpeaker 20 (32:22):\n\nNATO consider expelling Spain.\n\nDonald Trump (32:24):\n\nOh. I'm very unhappy with Spain. They're the only country that didn't raise up their number to 5%. Every other country in NATO raised up to 5%. And Spain is doing very well off our backs. So I'm not happy with Spain. Spain gets protection. And they know, look, they're in the semi middle of it so they're going to get automatically, even if you don't want to protect them, you're protecting them because of the way they're located. And I think what Spain did is a very bad thing for NATO. I think it's very unfair to NATO.\n\n(33:05)It wouldn't matter if you said you're not going to protect them because they're pretty much protected. What are you going to do? Go through the other countries and let's go attack Spain, right? So I think what they did is not nice. I think it's very disrespectful to NATO. In fact, I was thinking about giving them trade punishment through tariffs because of what they did, and I may do that. I think unbelievably disrespectful. Spain, the only one out of all the countries in NATO, the only one that said that is Spain, and I think they should be punished for that. Yes.\n\nSpeaker 21 (33:46):\n\nWith a government shutdown, you have the money to pay the troops on October 15?\n\nDonald Trump (33:48):\n\nI do.\n\nSpeaker 21 (33:48):\n\nOkay. How-\n\nDonald Trump (33:48):\n\nI actually have a man who is a very wealthy person, I know that when I tell you this, who called, a donor, a great gentleman, and he said, \"If there's any money necessary shortfall for the paying of the troops, then I will pay it,\" meaning he will pay it. How about that? I said, \"Look, we're not going to need it. We're going to take care of our troops.\" But this was a position that's being forced upon us by Democrats, and all they have to do is just sign a piece of paper saying, \"We're going to keep it going the way…\" It shouldn't even be an argument. They've signed it many times before. I don't want to bore you with the fact that Schumer said a hundred times, \"You should never close up government.\" But Schumer is a weakened politician.\n\n(34:38)He's going to finish his career as a failed politician. He's a failed politician. He's allowed the radical left to take over the Democrat Party. So if they write books about that, if they write books about him, they're going to have to say that his career ended by allowing the radical left to take over the party. I won an election in a landslide because people are not into the radical left and the Democrat Party is. People didn't want to see men playing in women's sports. They didn't want to see transgender for everybody. They didn't want to see all of the different things that they do that's so crazy. Open borders. The worst thing that he did to us is not inflation because we fixed inflation, prices are way down. I don't know if you saw that gasoline went to 58 just now. Did you see what's going on with gasoline?\n\nSpeaker 21 (35:32):\n\nWe track that.\n\nDonald Trump (35:33):\n\nNo, $58 a barrel.\n\nSpeaker 21 (35:36):\n\nYeah, we track that.\n\nDonald Trump (35:36):\n\nNobody can believe it. I'm very proud of that. You know why? Because we're pumping like we've never pumped before. Because if you get the gas price down, everything else comes down. It's very simple. And he went away from my policies and the last administration had the greatest inflation in the history of our country. And now as you know, groceries are down, it's all down.\n\nSpeaker 21 (35:58):\n\nBut on the shutdown, is this going to be a long term? Are we looking months?\n\nDonald Trump (35:59):\n\nIt's up to them. All they have to do is just vote to extend. We don't need it. We're not saying we want money. All we need is a right to extend. They want a right to extend, but they want $1.5 trillion so they can give it away to illegal immigrants, the people that are invading your cities. And many of these people, for whatever reason, I understood this, I called it a long time ago, these countries are run by people I know, friends of mine. I know this gentleman. I hope you haven't sent, you probably did too, why not? They send up their worst people. They send up people that are criminals. They send up people from jails. And the best ones they send up are people that don't work very hard and that are on a social form of welfare, and they're sending those people into the United States.\n\n(36:55)I don't blame them. I'm angry at them, but I don't blame them. But I'm really angry at Biden and Kamala and that group of lunatics for allowing it to happen because it's the hardest thing now. You know we're sending them out. It's incredible the job that Christie and Tom Homan and the whole group is doing, but we shouldn't have to be doing that. We're doing a lot of work on getting people out of here. Tren de Aragua has caused tremendous damage. And our soldiers are great. Our soldiers are now based on merit. They're not based on woke because we won the case in the Supreme Court, which was the bravest case. I have such respect for the Supreme Court because of what they did with merit because our country was built on merit. Countries are destroyed on woke.\n\n(37:45)I made a statement and I hated to make it because it sounded bad, but everything turns to you know what when it goes woke. You remember the term. I don't like to use it because you might have some children listening, but it turns bad. We have the hottest country right now anywhere in the world. That's why he's here. That's why every other country wants to meet here too, but we only have so many hours in the day and days in the week. But we got the hottest country. Think of it. We were a dead country a year and a half ago, and now we have the hottest country anywhere in the world. It's pretty good. We did a good job. Okay, any other questions?\n\nSpeaker 23 (38:26):\n\nMr. President-\n\nSpeaker 24 (38:28):\n\nWould you like to visit Argentina soon? Is there is an invitation for that?\n\nDonald Trump (38:35):\n\nWhat does that mean?\n\nSpeaker 24 (38:35):\n\nDo you like to visit Argentina soon?\n\nDonald Trump (38:35):\n\nI would love to, I'm just a little busy. I would love to. I'd love to go to Argentina. I'd like to be like Biden. I'd like to go to the beach. My legs are not quite as thin as his. My legs are slightly heavier. My arms are slightly larger. My body is a little bit larger than his. I'm not sure it would be appreciated on the beach, but I'm not going to take a chance. You won't see me in a bathing suit. You won't see in a bathing suit sitting on a beach in Argentina falling down, not being able to lift a three-ounce chair meant for old people to lift and he couldn't lift it so we had a problem. He spent too much time on a beach. Somebody told him that he looked good in a bathing suit and you'd see this guy on a beach all the time. I never quite understood. Steve, go ahead.\n\nSteve (39:26):\n\nPreview your meeting with Ukraine, President Zelenskyy on Friday, you expect to talk about weapons? Is there going to be a package-\n\nDonald Trump (39:32):\n\nInteresting meeting going on. Look, I'm very disappointed because Vladimir and I had a very good relationship, probably still do. I don't know why he continues with this war. This war has been so bad for him. He's going into four years of a war that he should have won in one week. He's now going to soon be into his fourth year. He's lost a million and a half soldiers, probably close, certainly in terms of wounded and no legs and no arms and all the things that happen in horrible wars. It's a horrible war. That's the biggest thing that's happened since World War II in terms of death. It's bigger than any of them. I settled eight of them. The biggest is that in terms of death. Incredible. I think India-Pakistan had great potential to it. We did a great job of that one.\n\n(40:21)But he's got to really settle this war. And they have long lines waiting for gasoline in Russia right now, right? They have long lines. Who thought that was going to happen? And all of a sudden his economy's going to collapse. And I'd like to see him do well. I had a very good relationship with Vladimir Putin, but he just doesn't want to end that war. And I think it's making him look very bad. He could end it. He could end it quickly. And I have to tell you, I give credit because who would think that Ukraine could have fought Russia for four years to essentially a standstill? Now, there has been some early, before they knew what the hell was happening because it happened quick. Biden should have never let that happen. That's a war that should have never happened, but it did. But it's not making Russia look good, I will tell you that.\n\nSpeaker 18 (41:13):\n\n[inaudible 00:41:14] hopes that Ukraine?\n\nDonald Trump (41:15):\n\nWe'll be talking about Ukraine, yeah. I have the president coming in on Friday. And I know what he has to say. He wants weapons. He would like to have Tomahawks. Everyone else wants Tomahawks. We have a lot of Tomahawks. Do you need any Tomahawks in Argentina?\n\nSpeaker 18 (41:31):\n\n[inaudible 00:41:31] tomahawks.\n\nDonald Trump (41:36):\n\nYou need them for your opposition, I guess, because see, in this country, they'd use Tomahawks for the opposition. I don't do that. I'm much nicer. The Democrats would use them if they had the chance. They're sick people. Go ahead.\n\nSpeaker 18 (41:47):\n\nMr President, are you worried that this plan with Argentina can fail?\n\nDonald Trump (41:52):\n\nAnything can fail. Anything can fail, you never know. That's why I say Putin should do something about the war because\n\nDonald Trump (42:00):\n\n… so far I mean, it's turned out to be very bad for him, but anything can… So this plan can fail. Sure, it can fail, but I would say, Scott, it's got a better chance of success than failure. And if it's successful, it's an unbelievable success. It can transform your country into greatness. It's got a great chance.\n\n(42:23)We'd like to give it a chance. Anything can fail, but we'd like to give it a chance. And we think, because he's made so much progress, I mean the work that he's done over the last four years is incredible and it would be a shame to lose that progress. He's very close to having a big success.\n\nSpeaker 25 (42:42):\n\nMr. President, Mr. President, will you consider removing new restrictions on the press that reported the Pentagon? And have you spoken to Secretary Hegseth about this?\n\nDonald Trump (42:49):\n\nI have, yeah. I mean, I think I can speak for him. I'll let him speak for himself, but I think he finds the press to be very disruptive in terms of world peace and maybe security for our nation. Press is very dishonest, not you, but the press is very dishonest. You have something to say, Peter?\n\nPete Hegseth (43:07):\n\nWell, I very much appreciate the question because it was interesting to watch. We had a chance to go along on the historic trip of Middle East Peace, which our generation of veterans never dreamed would be possible. So you would think that the Pentagon Press Corps of all Press Corps would be front and center across the board on wanting to give credit to the President for forging this kind of peace. And instead, what they want to talk about as a policy about them. Which simply says maybe the policy should look like the White House or other military installations where you have to wear a badge that identifies that your press or you can't just roam anywhere you want.\n\n(43:46)It used to be Mr. President, the press could go pretty much anywhere in the Pentagon, the most classified area in the world. Or also that if they sign onto the credentialing, they're not going to try to get soldiers to break the law by giving them classified information. So it's common sense stuff, Mr. President, we're trying to make sure national security is respected and we're proud of the policy.\n\nDonald Trump (44:06):\n\nWe have an option here as to, as you know, the press years ago moved into the White House. It used to be across the street. We could move them. You're lucky I'm president, because we could move them very easily across the street. They used to be there. They would have more room. We have a beautiful, nice space. You could sit all by yourselves and have fun. Instead, you walk around the White House talking to anybody that can breathe. But I find that when it comes to war, and now our great Department of War, we have some great people over there. I think it bothers me to have soldiers and even high-ranking generals walking around with you guys on their sleeve asking them, because they can make a mistake and a mistake can be tragic. They can do it innocently too.\n\n(44:55)And they're not press people. They don't really deal with the press. So they're not really necessarily good at it, although I think it's mostly instinctual one way or the other. You're either good at things or you're not. But I could see you being bothered by that. So you have them in an area and you treat them fairly, but they're not allowed to go into-\n\nPete Hegseth (45:13):\n\nMuch like the-\n\nDonald Trump (45:14):\n\n… somebody's office and sit with them for 10 hours.\n\nPete Hegseth (45:16):\n\nYes, sir.\n\nDonald Trump (45:17):\n\nYeah, I can understand.\n\nSpeaker 25 (45:17):\n\nMr. President. Mr. President.\n\nSpeaker 26 (45:20):\n\nBoston had some street takeovers that we saw. Are you going to work with or try and work with the mayor of Boston? And then they have a World Cup. They have several World Cup games. I know Argentina knows about World Cups. They have several World Cup games. Could those games move to cities that do work with Boston city?\n\nDonald Trump (45:35):\n\nWe can take them away. I love the people of Boston. I know the games are sold out, but your mayor is not good. They're worse than her. At least she's intelligent. Some are extremely low IQ. Those bother me more. She's intelligent, but she's radical left. And they're taking over parts of Boston. That's a pretty big statement, right?\n\n(45:57)We could get them back in about two seconds. All she has to do is call us. We'll go in and take them back. But she's afraid to because she thinks it's bad politically. She could take them back too. The Boston police are great. I know they love me. She'll never tell them to go after Trump because they love me and I love them. And I got a tremendous police vote and military vote and firemen vote. All of them.\n\n(46:19)No, I think she is hurting Boston. The answer is yes. If somebody is doing a bad job, and if I feel this unsafe conditions, I would call Johnny, the head of FIFA, who's phenomenal, and I would say, \"Let's move it to another location.\" And he would do that. He wouldn't love to do it, but he'd do it. Very easily he'd do it.\n\n(46:40)And this is the right time to do it. If I thought Boston was doing something that was going to cause safety conditions for the World Cup, I could say the same thing for the Olympics because we have events that are in different locations for the Olympics. It's based in LA. If I thought LA was not going to be prepared properly, I would move it to another location if I had to. On that one, I'd probably have to get a different kind of a permission, but we would do that.\n\n(47:10)Gavin Newsom, he's got to get his act together because had we not gone in at the beginning of my term, had we not gone in with a very strong powerful force, they would've lost LA. Now, you already lost 25,000 houses to fires. You got a big scar right in the middle of the city. And that should have never happened because they should have had the water flowing in from the Pacific Northwest. All they had to do is open up the valves. He didn't want to do it.\n\n(47:39)And he didn't want do it, he says, for environmental reasons, I don't believe that. But for some reason he didn't want to do it unless 25,000… You had no water in the fire pumps. You had no water in the sprinkler systems, in the ceilings. There were no houses that normally the things would go on. You might not have lost two houses. So if he doesn't play ball, we're going to have to be very tough with him. He's done a bad job.\n\n(48:05)You know what? Just to finish off on that, so when we went in, we did a phenomenal job. We went in with great force and that was the end of it. We put it out. We extinguished that fire, which was agitation, and it was a very dangerous position to be in. And we went and did a great job. But the head, the chief said, \"We could have never done this without President Trump and without the federal government coming in.\" Okay, that was it. He said that.\n\n(48:32)Now, two or three weeks later, he said, \"Oh, we could have done it,\" but he knows he couldn't have. The city was going to be taken over if I didn't go in. And you have to remember that Los Angeles was going to be taken over. And we have it where the chief said it, I believe numerous times, but that was as it was happening. That was a rough one, that was nasty. And if we saw a situation like that, yeah, we'd be forced to make a move. Boston better clean up their act, that's all I can say. Go ahead. One more question.\n\nSpeaker 25 (49:02):\n\nMr. President. [inaudible 00:49:03] Mr. President.\n\nDonald Trump (49:06):\n\nYeah, please.\n\nCrowd (49:06):\n\nDo you feel any urgency to end the shutdown in the next week, two weeks? Or would you be fine if this stretches into November and then toward the holidays with folks not getting paid?\n\nDonald Trump (49:16):\n\nWell, shutdown, we've had many, many shutdowns, and this is a shutdown that shouldn't have happened. A group of people brilliantly decided to make it after the election. I said, \"Thank you very much.\" In other words, give it to Trump instead of Biden. So it shouldn't happen. And likewise, debt ceiling shouldn't have. But the great, big, beautiful bill solved the debt ceiling problem for two years.\n\nCrowd (49:39):\n\nIs there a point where you would reach out to [inaudible 00:49:43]\n\nDonald Trump (49:43):\n\nNo. What's happening in the shutdown though? Honestly, can I put it in plain words for you? And you're a smart guy, so you'll understand, but a lot of people don't. The Democrats are getting killed on the shutdown because we're closing up programs that are Democrat programs that we were opposed to. And they're never going to come back in many cases. So we're being able to do things that we were unable to do before. So we're closing up programs that are Democrat programs that we wanted to close up or that we never wanted to happen. And now we're closing them up and we're not going to let them come back.\n\n(50:22)The Democrats are getting killed. And we're going to have a list of them on Friday closing up some of the most egregious, socialist, semi-communist, probably not full communist, we're saving that for New York, but semi-communist programs. And we're closing them up. We're not closing up Republican programs because we think they work. So the Democrats are getting killed, but they're not telling the people about that. Well, I haven't said it probably as bluntly as I just said it. So we are closing up Democrat programs that we think that we disagree with and they're never going to open again. Thank you very much. Thank you, everybody.\n\nCrowd (51:25):\n\n[inaudible 00:51:26]\n\n(51:25)Thank you, press. Thank you. Thank you, press. Let's go. Let's go.\n\nSpeaker 27 (51:25):\n\nAs China defends its presence in Latin America, what do you see for the US?\n\nDonald Trump (51:25):\n\nI think she wants your job.\n\nSpeaker 27 (51:25):\n\nSorry.\n\nDonald Trump (51:25):\n\nGood job.\n\nSpeaker 27 (51:25):\n\nOkay. Thank you.\n\nDonald Trump (51:25):\n\nGood job. Thank you though.\n\nSpeaker 27 (51:25):\n\nThank you.\n\nCrowd (51:25):\n\n[inaudible 00:51:39]",

    "transcript": "Donald Trump (00:02):\n\nThank you very much. So this was really a historic day, to put it mildly. Wasn't it amazing? Look at that last meeting, when you see the heads of those countries, those are serious countries. I thought it was fantastic, I did. And seeing the so-called hostages with those kids come back home, the way their parents just went crazy. Your father would not be that way with you. He'd be okay, but he wouldn't be like that.\n\nSpeaker 2 (00:33):\n\nI would get a hug.\n\nDonald Trump (00:33):\n\nA hug? A minor hug, okay. No, he would be, I'm only kidding. So how are you doing? Everybody okay? Are we good?\n\nSpeaker 3 (00:43):\n\nHow are you feeling?\n\nDonald Trump (00:44):\n\nI feel good. It's a long day, it's a long day, and we did a couple of big ones. That first one was… It's getting great reviews, I will tell you, there's a lot of meat in there. They're dissecting it and just playing it all night long. It's been very good. I think it's a very important day, because nobody thought this was possible, very good. And the press has been very respectful for a change, doesn't happen often. Go ahead, please, let's go.\n\nSpeaker 2 (01:16):\n\nWhat does it tell you about the world, that it seems like you got a much better reception in Israel than you would get in New York City right now?\n\nDonald Trump (01:27):\n\nI think I get a great reception in New York City.\n\nSpeaker 2 (01:29):\n\nI'm not saying that you don't, but it was on another level today.\n\nDonald Trump (01:33):\n\nWell, yeah, you're right, it was incredible. But I went to the Bronx and we had 31,000 people in a park in the Bronx, in New York City, during the campaign, 31,000. Do you remember that? And it was the friendliest crowd you've ever seen, and very diverse, but it was [inaudible 00:01:49]. New York is good, it's good.\n\nSpeaker 2 (01:52):\n\nNew York City, bad example, but it was… I don't know if you can see-\n\nDonald Trump (01:58):\n\nAre you admitting you made a mistake? I don't believe it. This is breaking news. No, I'm kidding. Let's go, go ahead.\n\nSpeaker 2 (02:01):\n\nFirst rule of politics, never admit a mistake.\n\nDonald Trump (02:04):\n\nNever admit a mistake.\n\nSpeaker 2 (02:05):\n\nBut it was, in the motorcade, I don't know if you could see, there were people hanging out of every apartment, balconies, inside the Knesset.\n\nDonald Trump (02:13):\n\nOkay, so I've heard… They said if you did Russia or if you did lots of different combinations, they say the Middle East blows it away. I said, \"Why [inaudible 00:02:25] it's just thousands of years, nothing's been done, it's the whole thing with the Arabs, Jewish people and everybody, it's just never been done before. And there's a certain mystery to the Middle East. Look, it's only because of the ratings, you're only as good as the ratings. If they weren't getting ratings, your people at Fox would… And by the way, Trey is excellent.\n\nSpeaker 2 (02:50):\n\nHe does a really good job.\n\nDonald Trump (02:52):\n\nHe was really good. We did a very quick interview, I was running to the second one where we were pretty late.\n\nSpeaker 2 (02:58):\n\nSomething that we heard from some of the Israelis on the ground, they want to know how the peace holds when you are not the president, so three years from now-\n\nDonald Trump (03:08):\n\nI can't answer it. I know this, and you are all witness, we go and I get 25,000, 35,000. If you look at a normal president will get 300 people, and that's not bad, they'll go to a ballroom, they'll get 300 people. We get 35… We had 117,000 people in New Jersey. And so, I can't tell you what's going to happen, but I'll be out there fighting for whoever it may be.\n\nSpeaker 2 (03:36):\n\nDid you tell Bibi beforehand that you were going to go off script and try to get [inaudible 00:03:41]-\n\nDonald Trump (03:42):\n\nNo, I actually told him I didn't want to bring up the pardon, but it was just the perfect spot, it was good timing. When you said… Because he was getting a very good hand, and when they stopped, they said, \"Why didn't he give this guy a pardon?\" If he didn't get a good hand, they wouldn't have done that. But the timing was… What do you think, Katie, good timing for that one?\n\nKatie (04:00):\n\nI think people thought it was pretty funny, yes.\n\nDonald Trump (04:03):\n\nIt worked out well. It was a little risque, bringing it up, pretty sore subject in Israel. But the people were fantastic.\n\nSpeaker 3 (04:13):\n\nMr. President, you spoke to Egypt-\n\nDonald Trump (04:15):\n\nOh, here we go. She can ask more questions this one. Go ahead.\n\nSpeaker 3 (04:15):\n\nI have some good questions, I promise.\n\nDonald Trump (04:15):\n\nYou do, you do. You were very nice today. Go ahead.\n\nSpeaker 3 (04:23):\n\nYou talked to President El-Sisi-\n\nDonald Trump (04:25):\n\nI did.\n\nSpeaker 3 (04:25):\n\n… and you spoke about, in that room, how Egypt has so little crime, and you said it's all about leadership. You talked about-\n\nDonald Trump (04:35):\n\nWell, they've very strong on crime.\n\nSpeaker 3 (04:35):\n\nYou talked about some of the governors-\n\nDonald Trump (04:36):\n\nYou wouldn't believe how strong. But they are very strong, but they don't have the kind of crime… They may have other kinds of crime, but their violent crime, you can actually walk down a park and not get mugged or hit over there with a baseball bat.\n\nSpeaker 3 (04:48):\n\nDo you want to see some US governors be more like Egypt?\n\nDonald Trump (04:51):\n\nNo, I want them to be stronger and tougher and not allow us to have record-breaking crime in Chicago and different places. I want them to admit they have crime. So there were 4,000 shootings in Chicago, murders, over a fairly short period of time, meaning like a year and a half, I think, 4,000 murders, many, many thousands of you're hit by a bullet but don't die. I want them to say, \"We have a problem. Could Trump bring in the troops and solve the problem?\" Like I did in D.C., like I'm doing in Memphis. If you see the crimes way down in Memphis, and we've only been there seven days, way down.\n\nSpeaker 3 (05:31):\n\nThe courts have been standing in your way here [inaudible 00:05:34]-\n\nDonald Trump (05:35):\n\nThey have been. The lower courts have.\n\nSpeaker 3 (05:36):\n\nAre you using the Insurrection Act, where you-\n\nDonald Trump (05:41):\n\nThe lower… Well, I could use it. If I wanted to, I could use it. Look, that's a very simple answer, I'm allowed to use the Insurrection Act. In fact, that was on Stephanopoulos today, his Slopodopoulos show. They asked sloppy Chris Christie about the Insurrection Act. He said, \"Well, if you're talking about the Insurrection Act, he's got the absolute right to use that.\" And he said a couple of things, he said 50% of the presidents that served in office have used the Insurrection Act, and the Insurrection Act, according to all of them, said it can't even be challenged. I don't have to go there yet because I'm winning on appeal. You're right, we're losing with radical left judges, generally, radical left judges, and we're winning on appeal, so we'll see what happens.\n\nSpeaker 3 (06:25):\n\nI'll be speaking to Governor JB Pritzker tomorrow. Do you have any messages or questions for him?\n\nDonald Trump (06:30):\n\nWell, I think he should beg for help, because he's running a bad operation and he's letting people be killed in his city because he doesn't want… In Chicago, and I love Chicago, Chicago can be a great city again. And very quickly, I would have Chicago cleaned out, the criminals removed, we would remove them. In D.C., we took out 1,700 career criminals, hard-line criminals, that's why it's so good right now. D.C. is setting records the other way, it's never been so safe, and the restaurants have never done better business. They were closing restaurants, now they're opening new restaurants. I can do the same thing on a larger scale in Chicago, and Pritzker should ask me to do it.\n\n(07:12)But when you mentioned Insurrection, you were the one that mentioned, one of you mentioned Insurrection, I could do that, and many presidents have.\n\nKatie (07:22):\n\nDo you have an update on-\n\nDonald Trump (07:23):\n\n50%, Katie, 50% of the presidents have used the Insurrection because they don't want to go through this stuff, where somebody said there's no crime and 4,000 people got shot.\n\nKatie (07:35):\n\nMaybe you'll have to use it.\n\nDonald Trump (07:37):\n\nYou [inaudible 00:07:37] have to convince, because she tends to be on the conservative side.\n\nKatie (07:40):\n\nDo you have an update on the Schumer shutdown and Democrats still continuing to [inaudible 00:07:45]-\n\nDonald Trump (07:44):\n\nWell, here's the Schumer shutdown, it's… Look, they want to have healthcare for illegals that have come in, many of these people are criminals and they want to have healthcare. And what it also does is… We have nobody coming in now, we haven't really like that, if they start winning cases like this, we're going to have a rush on our border, because they're going to come up for healthcare and the other things that they give away. Look at some Newsom, education, healthcare, he gives everything away. People come up for that, people come from other countries for that, so we can't have it, we can't have that. We have people coming into our country, but they're coming in legally.\n\nKatie (08:20):\n\nDo you have any more meetings with leadership this week?\n\nDonald Trump (08:20):\n\nWe have the strongest border we've ever had, but they are coming in, Katie, they're coming in legally through a process.\n\nKatie (08:26):\n\nDo you have any planned meetings with House and Senate leadership on the Republican side to figure out this week?\n\nDonald Trump (08:31):\n\nYeah, I'm meeting with them, I talk to them all the time. John Thune's been great and Mike has been great, speaker, he's been great, those two guys have done a great job. But we're dealing with a bunch of radical left lunatics that have lost an election in a landslide. They don't even admit that. Think of it, they lost the election 2,700, in terms of counties, to 525, that's where the map is entirely. They lost all seven swing states, they lost the popular vote, and then they say, \"Oh, the election was close.\" She says the election was a landslide. But they lie.\n\n(09:12)They can take any subject, like Newsome does, says, \"Oh no, Los Angeles is doing great.\" If we didn't go into Los Angeles, they would've had to cancel the Olympics. And the head of law enforcement said, and he said it very strongly, \"We could not have handled this if Trump didn't bring those people in.\" Two weeks later, he said, \"Oh, we could have,\" because he was told to say that. But we did a great job in Los Angeles. First of all, you lost half of it with the fires, and I think this would've been maybe even worse. They had no control, when we went in, the police had totally lost control, and he admitted it, the head, whoever he is, whatever his name is, he admitted it very strongly.\n\nKatie (09:57):\n\nWhat's your reaction to President Bill Clinton giving you credit for ending the war in Gaza, and others [inaudible 00:10:01].\n\nDonald Trump (10:00):\n\nI've always liked Bill Clinton, I've always got along with him. He used to be a friend of mine, he came to my wedding. So did she, a lot of people don't know that. But I've always liked him. I thought it was very nice, actually.\n\nSpeaker 5 (10:16):\n\nMr. President-\n\nDonald Trump (10:17):\n\nAnd what is he doing? He's telling the truth, because nobody else has been able to deal with talking about the Middle East. Yes?\n\nSpeaker 5 (10:23):\n\nMr. President, I wanted to ask you about your conversations with world leaders today. You said that everybody is unifying over your plan, but we heard from President Sisi calling for a two-state solution, an independent Palestinian state.\n\nDonald Trump (10:37):\n\nYou're talking about a different plan. I'm talking about something very much different. We're talking about rebuilding Gaza. I'm not talking about single-state or double-state or two-state, we're talking about the rebuilding of Gaza.\n\nSpeaker 5 (10:51):\n\nWhat's the road ahead for governing Gaza?\n\nDonald Trump (10:54):\n\nWell, we'll have to see. A lot of people like the one-state solution, some people like the two-state solution, so we'll have to see. I haven't commented on that.\n\nSpeaker 5 (11:00):\n\nHow do you see bridging that gap? Because the Arab countries [inaudible 00:11:05]-\n\nDonald Trump (11:04):\n\nAt some point, I'll decide what I think is right, but I'd be in coordination with other states and other countries.\n\nSpeaker 5 (11:11):\n\nAnd are you satisfied, some people might say it feels premature declaring peace for the whole Middle East, 3,000 years [inaudible 00:11:19].\n\nDonald Trump (11:19):\n\nPremature, why? You want more people to be killed? What do you want, another 300,000, 400,000 people to be killed, is that what you're looking for?\n\nSpeaker 5 (11:25):\n\nBut in terms of the risks in Gaza, in an already [inaudible 00:11:29]-\n\nDonald Trump (11:30):\n\nRisk? Risk? So you mean let them fight on for another couple of years and let some more buildings fall down on top of people and keep it going on? No, we did it the right way. We did it… I think our timing was perfect, actually.\n\nSpeaker 5 (11:41):\n\nAnd in terms of-\n\nDonald Trump (11:42):\n\nYou don't really mean that. You mean you want them to fight on, right?\n\nSpeaker 5 (11:45):\n\nI'm just asking about the phase two of the negotiations and how confident you are that those can get underway.\n\nDonald Trump (11:51):\n\nWe have a lot of power. That was a power room. Those people, those are the richest countries. I think now with tariffs, I think we're the richest country in the world, actually, the United States, we're taking in hundreds of millions of dollars. But those are really seriously rich countries, and they can handle it.\n\nSpeaker 3 (12:13):\n\nSome of those players, or particularly Erdogan, could they also help in the war between Russia and Ukraine?\n\nDonald Trump (12:17):\n\nYeah, Erdogan can, he's respected by Russia. Ukraine, I can't tell you about. But he is respected by Putin, and he's a friend of mine, you can see. I get along with the tough ones. I don't get along with the weak ones, I get along with the tough ones, I don't know what that is. But Erdogan's been great with me. When NATO has a problem with Erdogan, which they often do, they call me to talk to him, and I've never failed at working it out immediately. Is that right? How's Karoline doing? Is she doing good? Should Karoline be replaced?\n\nKatie (12:48):\n\nNo. She's great.\n\nSpeaker 3 (12:54):\n\nThat's up to you, sir.\n\nDonald Trump (12:54):\n\nIt'll never happen.\n\nKaroline (12:54):\n\nNobody wants to say-\n\nKatie (12:54):\n\nI said she does a great job.\n\nKaroline (12:54):\n\nThank you.\n\nKatie (12:56):\n\nDo you want to elaborate on the-\n\nDonald Trump (12:58):\n\nThose lips, they move like a machine gun, right?\n\nKatie (13:00):\n\nDo you want to elaborate on the countries you consider weak?\n\nDonald Trump (13:04):\n\nThey really are… Okay, what?\n\nKatie (13:06):\n\nDo you want to comment on the leaders you consider weak who are in that room?\n\nDonald Trump (13:09):\n\nNo, I won't comment on that, but you know probably who they are.\n\nKatie (13:14):\n\nI have an idea.\n\nSpeaker 3 (13:14):\n\nBefore we-\n\nDonald Trump (13:14):\n\nI don't know that really… Yeah, there were a couple in the room.\n\nKatie (13:16):\n\nYou mean their countries?\n\nDonald Trump (13:18):\n\nBut overall, I thought that was an amazing group of people. I don't think they've ever seen a sandwich like that, between power, money, et cetera, there's never been anything like that.\n\nSpeaker 3 (13:28):\n\nOn the way here, you said-\n\nDonald Trump (13:31):\n\nBut you know what? I have to… Because the plane is going to take off.\n\nSpeaker 7 (13:33):\n\nAre you hosting Zelenskyy at the White House on Friday?\n\nDonald Trump (13:34):\n\nI think so.\n\nSpeaker 7 (13:35):\n\nYes.\n\nDonald Trump (13:36):\n\nBye everybody.\n\nSpeaker 2 (13:37):\n\nThanks, President Trump.\n\nSpeaker 3 (13:38):\n\nThank you.\n\nDonald Trump (13:38):\n\nHave a good time. Thank you everybody.",

    "transcript": "Speaker 1 (00:00):\n\nHe's… has one of the most powerful armies actually in the world. It's much more powerful than he even lets known. If you look at some of the recent conflicts, he was at the top of them and he was winning them, and he did win. And he doesn't want any credits, he doesn't want anything. He just wants to be left alone. He's a tough cookie, but he's been my friend. And every time I've ever needed him, he's been there for me, so I just want to thank President Erdogan, Türkiye. [inaudible 00:00:25]. If NATO has a problem with him, because he is difficult, they call me, they said, \"Would you do me a favor, could you just speak to Erdogan?\" And I do, and he never fails us. Right, General? He never fails. He's amazing. So, I just want to thank you for the friendship, it's good. Thank you very much.\n\n(00:44)And then, of course, we have the host tonight, and I just want to thank you very much. It was a reason we chose Egypt because you were very helpful, and very, very helpful. Everybody wanted to have this, but we really thought it was appropriate. And you are a great leader, you are very good on crime. You have problems that other countries don't have, and of course, nothing's perfect, but the job you do is amazing and I want to thank you. Another one, you've been my friend right from the beginning, during the campaign against Crooked Hillary Clinton. Have you heard of her? We were both downstairs waiting to go up to meet this gentleman who has a place called Egypt, the oldest civilization, they say 6,000 years. China's 5,000 years, but you're actually number one. 6,000 years, can you believe it? But the oldest, they say, civilization.\n\n(01:41)So, I went up to meet them first, and we liked each other so much that you waited for about an hour and a half, and I think your meeting lasted about two minutes with them, so I always remembered that. But that was our first meeting, we had great chemistry together, and he's a fantastic man and a fantastic general, by the way. But he's a great president, and I want to thank Egypt and all of your representatives for treating us all so well. Thank you.\n\n(02:10)So [inaudible 00:02:11] representative of a whole group of nations, and they're sitting behind us, and you know most of them, I can tell you this guy's got so much money. They all have so much. There's more money and power sitting behind us. I love that they're behind us. They've never been sitting behind anybody before. This is a very unique position for them, but seriously they're among the most powerful countries in the world, the richest countries in the world, and there's never been really an assemblage like what we have today, I don't think so. I've never seen it, anyway. And I want to thank everybody for being with us. [inaudible 00:02:52] I just solved the war for him. Azerbaijan. [inaudible 00:02:57]. There he is.\n\nSpeaker 3 (02:50):\n\n[inaudible 00:03:01].\n\nSpeaker 4 (02:50):\n\n[inaudible 00:03:03].\n\nSpeaker 2 (03:03):\n\nYou two guys are still getting along, right? They fought for 32 years. In about one hour we settled it, right? And they like each other now too. That's great. Well, I want to thank everybody for being here. Italy, she's a very strong ruler. She's doing a great job. You're doing a great job. Thank you [inaudible 00:03:22]. We're actually going to be making a speech after this, so this is just a very important signing, but we're doing a signing, then we're doing a speech, and then I may stay behind with the leaders just to talk about that. Some things… want to thank the media for very… You've been so respectful on this deal, the importance of the deal.\n\n(03:44)And it was so pleasant to watch. I was on the plane for quite a while listening to the various newscasts, and they were all fair. They were talking about how incredible this is. This is an incredible day for the world, let alone the Middle East. So, I just wanted to thank the media, they really treated it with respect. I wish you could be like that on other things, but that's perhaps too much to ask for. But on this tremendous… Everybody feels the same, just tremendous respect, and we appreciate it very much. Can we get the documents, please? Okay.\n\n(04:20)Okay. You'll sign right here, Mr. President.\n\nSpeaker 1 (04:23):\n\nOkay.\n\nSpeaker 2 (04:23):\n\nRight here.\n\nSpeaker 1 (04:40):\n\nOkay.\n\nSpeaker 2 (04:40):\n\n[inaudible 00:04:42].\n\nSpeaker 1 (04:52):\n\nThis took 3,000 years to get to this point. Can you believe it? And it's going to hold up too. It's going to hold up. Okay, thank you.\n\nSpeaker 2 (05:05):\n\nThank you.\n\nSpeaker 1 (05:07):\n\nYou can use my pen if you want.\n\nSpeaker 2 (05:07):\n\n[inaudible 00:05:08].\n\nSpeaker 1 (05:07):\n\nHave a pen? Want to use mine?\n\nSpeaker 5 (05:07):\n\n[inaudible 00:05:11].\n\nSpeaker 1 (05:24):\n\nOkay. Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2 (06:00):\n\nOkay. [inaudible 00:07:02], Mr. President.\n\nSpeaker 1 (06:00):\n\nOkay.\n\nSpeaker 2 (06:00):\n\nYou can hold it up for photos.\n\nSpeaker 1 (06:00):\n\nOkay.\n\nSpeaker 2 (06:00):\n\nYou can hold it up for photos.\n\nSpeaker 1 (06:36):\n\nOkay, fine. I think we're going to hold it up. I don't hold up the signature page. Yeah. So we're going to go and I'm going to say a few words. We'll give you a little speech, and then we're going to meet with the leaders after that, and spend a little time together without the media. The media's invited to the speech. I just want to tell you the people behind me and some of the people in the room that are so helpful. But the people behind me are the greatest leaders, most powerful leaders, the richest leaders, frankly. Sometimes it's not politically correct to say that, but I'll say it. The richest in the world, that the world has ever seen. And yet, when you get to know them, I know every one of them, in their own way, and I can say in particular some, because that's the way life works, but some of the greatest people you'll ever meet, and people that really care for their countries. And why this happened is they all came together and they wanted to get Gaza straightened out, they wanted to get the whole thing straightened out.\n\n(08:26)It got to a point where it was just crazy. And once they got together and once we started talking, it went, to me, it went smoothly, it went so smoothly. You were such a big help, but it went so smoothly that nobody could even believe it that we're sitting here and getting this all certified out and all done. And everybody's happy about it. Everybody's happy about it like I've never seen before, actually. I've done other deals and people don't care as much. Big deals. I think they're big deals, but this is something that's taken off like a rocket ship.\n\n(09:01)And it did from the beginning, and I've heard for years, \"This is the biggest deal, it'll never happen.\" For years, long before I ran for office, that this is the Middle East. It's the biggest, most complicated deal, and also it's the place that could lead to tremendous problems like World War III. They always talk about World War III would start in the Middle East. And that's not going to happen. We don't want it to start anywhere, actually, but it's not going to happen. So, I just want to thank everybody and I'll see you in a little while. And in particular, thank you all. Thank you Tamim, Mr. General, thank you very much. Thank you very much. Great job. Great job. Great job. Thank you. Thank you very much everybody. Thank you. Okay.\n\nSpeaker 6 (09:43):\n\nNow we can…\n\nSpeaker 7 (18:00):\n\nYes, state of leaders, kindly join us at the stage, please. State of leaders, kindly join us at the stage.\n\n(18:26)Head of states, head of states, kindly join us at the stage. Please, all the head of states, kindly join us at the stage. Excuse me, head of states, kindly join us at the stage. All head of states, kindly join us at the stage. Kindly, all the leaders join us at the stage. Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 8 (28:34):\n\n[foreign language 00:28:29] His Excellency, President Abdel Fattah El-Sisi, the President of the Arab Republic of Egypt.\n\nPresident Abdel Fattah El-Sisi (28:38):\n\n[foreign language 00:28:52]\n\nPresident Donald Trump (36:00):\n\nWell, thank you very much and that was a great honor. I appreciate it very much, Mr. President. Mr. General, Mr. President. Great general, great president. Thank you very much. This is the day that people across the region and around the world have been working, striving, hoping, and praying for. They have done things over the last month that I think were really unthinkable. Nobody thought this could happen. With the historic agreement we've just signed, those prayers of millions have finally been answered. As you know, the hostages have been returned and further work goes on having to do with the, sadly to say, bodies. Together we've achieved what everybody said was impossible. At long last, we have peace in the Middle East. And it's a very simple expression, peace in the Middle East. And we've heard it for many years, but nobody thought it could ever get there and now we're there.\n\n(38:36)I want to congratulate everybody sitting in these first few rows and standing behind me. I don't know why they chose to stand, but I promise I'll make it short. Okay? We are not going to keep you standing for long. These are great leaders. After years of suffering and bloodshed, the war in Gaza is over. Humanitarian aid is now pouring in, including hundreds of truckloads of food and medical equipment and other supplies. Much of it paid for by people in this room. Civilians are returning to their homes. The hostages are reuniting. I mean, it's beautiful. I'm just watching it backstage. The level of love and sorrow. I've never seen anything like it. It's amazing when you see they haven't seen their mother, their father, they haven't seen them in such a long time and they lived in a tunnel, very little tunnel, very deep, and the level of love is just incredible. It's a beautiful thing to see.\n\n(39:36)In one sense, it's so horrible that it could have taken place, but in another sense, it's so beautiful to see a new and beautiful day is rising and now the rebuilding begins. The rebuilding is maybe going to be the easiest part. I think we've done a lot of the hardest part because the rest comes together. We all know how to rebuild and we know how to build better than anybody in the world. I want to express my tremendous gratitude to the Arab and Muslim nations who helped make this incredible breakthrough possible, and you really did. To President el-Sisi of Egypt, who is so generously hosting us today. And I want to thank you for the outstanding job your country is doing in so many different ways and for helping us so much with this peace agreement. I also want to thank the president for the escort of six fighter jets.\n\n(40:28)Oh, we looked out the window. We said, \"I hope they're friendly.\" And they turned out to be very friendly. But we had three on each side and they are beauties right out of the great really American manufacturing hub. We make the greatest military equipment in the world. We have the strongest military in the world by far. And I knew exactly what those planes were and I knew exactly how much you paid for those planes too. You paid a lot, but you got a pretty good deal and they are great planes, and we just appreciated, that was quite an escort in. It was very impressive.\n\n(41:01)But Air Force One, really, it was covered with Egyptian desert. Just a few months ago, if you think about it, just a few months ago it was Egyptian desert and now it was just a few feet off our window and it was a spectacular site and I appreciate it very much. Really, that was pretty good. You got our people by surprise. I don't know if they were thrilled right at the beginning, but they were thrilled as we sailed along very calmly and safely. And I'm deeply honored to receive from you, Egypt's highest state honor, the Order of the Nile. The Nile is so beautiful, so magnificent. It's such a beautiful title. The Order of the Nile. Thank you very much Mr. President. Appreciate it. Great honor.\n\n(41:48)I also want to give a very special thanks to the Amir of Qatar, a man who's outstanding. He's been a friend of mine for a long time. Long before politics. Long before politics. And he's a fantastically respected man. His Highness Sheikh Tamim is respected by everybody. He's respected by everybody and in the most positive way, not only because of power, because of his heart. He's got a tremendous heart and he's a great leader and his country loves him. Thank you very much for being here. It's an honor. Let me also express our condolences to the Qataris on the tragic car crash that claimed the lives of your cherished diplomats, some of whom were known by our people and they were supposed to be incredible people. So please extend our sorrow and best wishes. That was tough. That was really tough.\n\n(42:46)On this extraordinary occasion, I also want to give our sincere thanks to President Erdogan of Turkey. He's always there when I need him. He is such a tough guy. He is tough as you can be, but we love him. And when they have a problem with you, they always call me to handle it and usually I come through. We just have a good relationship, but we have from the beginning. And so I want to thank you very much and say hello to your wife, your beautiful wife, and it's great to be with you. Always there when I need him. He's always there. Thank you very much, Mr. President.\n\n(43:21)And I also want to thank, I just spoke to him on the phone. His Royal Highness Crown Prince Mohammed of Saudi Arabia, special friend of mine. Boy, he's come so long and so far and he's doing a fantastic job for his country, and I want to just thank him. And his Highness, Sheikh Mohammed of the United Arab Emirates is here. Where? He's here someplace. Well, oh, he's not here, but he's here in spirit. I can tell you that. And he's been another one. He's been absolutely incredible and we appreciate it very much.\n\n(44:01)And his Majesty, King Abdullah of Jordan. And thank you very much, King Abdullah of Jordan. He's here. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you very much. You really have been a great help and we appreciate it. Appreciate it. Prime Minister Sharif of Pakistan. Also, I have to say my favorite field marshal from Pakistan, who's not here, but the Prime Minister is here and you're going to give his regards. Where are you? There you go. Thank you very much. Do you want to say what you said to me the other day? Come. Would you like to say what you said the other day? I think it was so nice. Please.\n\nPresident Shehbaz Sharif (44:46):\n\nThank you very much. My dear President Trump, my dear brother, President Fattah al-Sisi of Egypt, Majesties, Highness', Excellencies, Leading Gentlemen, as-salamu alaykum and a very good evening. Well, I would say today is one of the greatest day in contemporary history because peace has been achieved after untiring efforts. Efforts led by President Trump, who is genuinely a man of peace. Who has relentlessly and untiringly worked throughout these months, day in and day out, to make this world a place to live with peace and prosperity. I would say that Pakistan had nominated President Donald Trump for Nobel Peace Prize, for his outstanding extraordinary contributions to first stop war between India and Pakistan, and then achieve ceasefire along with his very wonderful team.\n\n(46:36)Today again, I would like to nominate this great president for Nobel Peace Prize, because I genuinely feel that he's the most genuine and most wonderful candidate for Peace Prize because he has brought not only peace in South Asia, saved millions of people their lives. And today, here in Sharm el-Sheikh, achieving peace in Gaza is saving millions of lives in the Middle East. Mr. President, I would like to salute you-\n\nPresident Donald Trump (47:27):\n\nThank you.\n\nPresident Shehbaz Sharif (47:29):\n\n… for your exemplary leadership, visionary leadership. And I think that you are the man this world needed most at this point in time. World would always remember you as a man who did everything, went out of the way to stop seven and today, eight wars. I would like to thank my very dear brother Sheikh Tamim. He's a Al ash-Sheikh who has really worked very hard along with others to achieve peace in this region. My very dear brother, President Tayyip Erdogan, his Majesty, King Abdullah, and of course my very dear brother Mohamed bin Zayed of UAE and of course my very dear brother Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia. And he has also been very, very helpful and contributed very valuably in this wonderful peace process.\n\n(48:41)Ladies and gentlemen, I wouldn't want to take more of your time. Suffice to say, had it not been for this gentleman, who knows, India and Pakistan are both nuclear powers. Had he not intervened along with his wonderful team, during those four days, the war could have escalated to level, who would've lived to tell what happened. And similarly, here in this part of the world in Middle East, Mr. President, your valuable contribution along with President Sisi, I think history will remember in golden words. I wouldn't say more accept. God bless you. God give you long life to serve like this for all time to come. Thank you very much.\n\nPresident Donald Trump (49:37):\n\nThat was beautiful. Thank you very much. Wow.\n\nPresident Shehbaz Sharif (49:44):\n\nVery kind.\n\nPresident Donald Trump (49:46):\n\nThank you. Wow, I didn't expect that. Let's go home. There's nothing more I have to say. Goodbye everybody. That was really beautiful and beautifully delivered. Wow, thank you very much. Also with us is President Prabowo, a very incredible man of Indonesia. President? Come here. Great job. President Abbas of The Palestinian Authority. See, we have them all. We have them all. Great. It's good to have you. And so many others. Really, I have a list here. This first three rows and what's standing behind me. I don't know why they chose to stand, but it's there. They're going to be very famous tomorrow, all of them.\n\n(50:42)We have the Arab League is represented by his Excellency, and thank you very much for being here. Thank you very much. We have Armenia. Oh, and Azerbaijan. That's a little war that we stopped. That's a little war. There they are. Look at them, they're sitting. When I met with them, it was in the Oval Office. They fought for like 31 years or some crazy number, and they had one sitting on that side of the Oval Office, one sitting… By the time we finished in one hour, they were both hugging each other and now they're friends and they're getting along great. Look at it. So I want to thank you both. That's incredible. Really incredible.\n\n(51:27)So you have Armenia and you have Bahrain, you have Canada. It's so great to have. In fact, the President called and he wanted to know if it's worthwhile. He knew exactly what it was. He knew the importance. Where's Canada, by the way? Where are you? He knew the importance of this. He said, \"I want to be there.\" So many people have done that. They called. I mean, they heard about it. And these are not people that can do that very easily. They have pretty big schedules, to put it mildly. The most powerful people. And I appreciate you being here very much, Mr. President. Fantastic. Fantastic. And Cyprus, Egypt, the European Union, it's a lot of countries. France, thank you very much, Emmanuel. I would imagine Emmanuel standing someplace behind me. Where is he? I can't believe it. You're taking a low-key approach today. He's my friend. That's great. Good job. Thank you very much. Emmanuel.\n\n(52:32)Germany, the new Chancellor of Germany, he's easy to spot because he's very tall and he's very smart and he's doing a fantastic job for his country. Appreciate it very much. And congratulations. A big election. That was a big one that was going to change things. Greece, we have Greece. We have Hungary. Oh, Victor, where is Victor? Victor. Victor. We love Victor. Victor, I call him. I put the little accent on it. You are fantastic. All right. I know a lot of people don't agree with me, but I am the only one that matters. What you are fantastic. He's a great leader. I endorsed him the last election he had, and he won by 28 points. So you're going to do even better this time if you have another election, and you're going to do great and we appreciate it and we're behind you 100%. That's Hungary. India is a great country with a very good friend of mine at the top, and he's just done a fantastic job. And I think that Pakistan and India are going to live very nicely together, right?\n\nPresident Shehbaz Sharif (53:44):\n\nYeah.\n\nPresident Donald Trump (53:47):\n\nThat's not a very… They are. They are. And the two great, I tell you, leaders. Great leaders as far as I'm concerned. Indonesia, we covered. And I just want to say that\n\nSpeaker 9 (54:01):\n\nThat's a big country, a powerful country. It does unbelievably well, and it's great to have you. Iraq, we have Iraq. With lots of oil, they have so much oil, they don't know what to do with it. That's a big problem when you have so much, you have no idea what to do with it. So, thank you very much for… Thank you very much. Italy, we have a woman, a young woman, who's… I'm not allowed to say it because usually it's the end of your political career if you say it. She's a beautiful young woman. Now, if you use the word \"Beautiful\" in the United States about a woman, that's the end of your political career, but I'll take my chances. Where is she? There she is. You don't mind being called beautiful, right? Because, you are. Thank you very much for coming. We appreciate it. She wanted to be here and she's incredible. And they really respect her in Italy. She's a very successful politician. We have Norway. Oh, Norway, [inaudible 00:54:59], Norway. What happened Norway? What happened?\n\n(55:04)Where's Norway? Where is he? We have Johnny. We're going to the World Cup. I can't tell you that. Where's Norway? I don't think he wants to stand… Oh, he's back there. We have Norway. Oman. Again, we have Paraguay. We have a really fantastic representative from Saudi Arabia. Thank you very much. I'll tell you what, and this time we get you the best seat. He always gets the best seat, he deserves the best seat. But, what a great place it is. Spain, where's Spain? Are you guys working on him with respect to the GDP? We'll get close. We'll get close. But, fantastic job you're doing. And UAE, which is great. United Kingdom. Where's United Kingdom? Where's [inaudible 00:56:01]-\n\nSpeaker 10 (56:00):\n\n[inaudible 00:56:01].\n\nSpeaker 9 (56:02):\n\nCome here. Is everything going good?\n\nSpeaker 10 (56:06):\n\nVery good.\n\nSpeaker 9 (56:07):\n\nIt's very nice of you here. These people all came on 20 minute notice. And I think it's fantastic. And we have so many others, and just so many others. And it's such a compliment to what we're doing, because what we've done is something very unique and very special. So, it's perhaps the wealthiest and most powerful group of nations ever assembled at one time, which is a big thing. We have achieved together in recent days a change that really is historic and it's going to be remembered forever. And I want to thank the American team for their amazing work. And I want to thank, I think he'll go down as the greatest Secretary of State in the history of our country. I really believe that. Marco, I wouldn't say it, Marco Rubio. I wouldn't say it. Maybe I would.\n\n(56:56)You're doing a great job. I'll tell you he's on course to do it. We've done a lot of work in nine months. We've done a lot of work. I say that, one year ago, a little more, but one year ago, America, the United States of America was in… I say it was a dead country. The king told me. And I used that. He said, \"Sir, one year ago, it was a dead country. Today you have the hottest country anywhere in the world.\" And it is, it's the hottest country. So, many investors are here. We have over $17 trillion being invested in the United States, which is a record that nobody has ever beaten. I don't think anybody will. And we still have four months to go before it's a year. So, in eight months we have over 17 trillion. We're actually very close to $18 trillion. Has never been… As an example, the previous administration had less than 1 trillion over four years. We're close to breaking $18 trillion in eight months.\n\n(57:58)That's pretty amazing. No country's ever done that. I want to also thank special envoy, Steve Witkoff and my son-in-law and a great guy, Jared Kushner. And I even have my daughter here. Ivanka. Ivanka, please stand up. Ivanka's here. Wow. Thank you. Thank you, Ivanka. We have a great team, and we have, as you know, General Raizin Caine. We have John Radcliffe. We have Tom Barrack. We have really a lot of good talent. We have Pete Hegseth, who's now Department of War as opposed to Department of Defense. We made a little change. Somehow I like the name better, so do you, so do a lot of people. But, the momentous breakthrough that we're here to celebrate tonight is more than the end of the war in Gaza. It's with God's help it'll be the new beginning for an entire beautiful Middle East. From this moment forward, we can build a region that's strong, and stable, and prosperous, and united in rejecting the path of terror once and for all.\n\n(59:02)We want to get rid of the terror and get onto other things. There are many other things in life that's so good. The final sprint to this deal began less than three weeks ago on the sidelines of the United Nations in New York. I met with many of the people in this room. And it all just started coming together. I've known so many of you for so long, you friends of mine, you're great people. I have a couple I don't like in particular, but I won't tell you who. I have actually a few of them I don't like at all. But, you'll never find out who they are. Maybe you will come to think of it. But, I have most of you who I like a lot and I respect a lot. Maybe that's more important. We listened and we exchanged ideas, and we kept pushing forward until the job was done.\n\n(59:47)And the first steps to peace are always the hardest. And today we've taken them and we've put them all together and we've come up with this beautiful mix like nobody thought was possible. And as you know, I've just come from Israel. It was an amazing day to watch the hostages come in, and to watch all of the other things and do all of the other things that we did. And like all of us here this evening, the Israeli people are overjoyed that the war has ended. Many of you have had dancing in the streets, they had dancing in the streets, and they've been dancing for weeks now once they heard about this and they heard that it was even a possibility. They're related at the arrival of the hostages and excited to begin this new chapter for the entire region. And it's going to be that.\n\n(01:00:33)And they are going to be great partners. And I hope everybody's going to join the Abraham Accord. I like to say the Avraham… I love Avraham, but somehow it doesn't sound as good when I say it as it does when some of my other friends say it, who too are from the region. But, we're going to get a lot of people joining the Abraham Accord. We have the four great nations that did it early on and they stayed with it. And then you had the Biden administration, which is the worst administration in the history of our country. And obviously they did nothing on that, and anything else. And so, it stayed at four. And now a lot of people, even today they're talking about all joining up. So, so many people have talked to me about that. And it's going to be a great tribute to really the United States.\n\n(01:01:19)The United States has worked very hard in the Middle East, so it would be a tribute to us, and to Jared, and to Steve, and to all of the people, Marco, all of the people that have worked so hard on that. And it really is going to bring… It's going to guarantee that it all stays together. And you're going to do well because the four nations do very well. They do extremely as… They're wealthy, but they're a lot wealthier because of it. So, I hope everybody's now joining up. Now we have no excuses. We don't have a Gaza and we don't have an Iran as an excuse. That was a good excuse, but we don't have that anymore. All the momentum now is toward a great glorious and lasting peace, and our commitment to fulfilling the 20-point plan we developed together, will be the crucial foundation for achieving that bright future.\n\n(01:02:08)And it's being worked on right now as we speak. And we're actually in stage three and four. It's not going to be just divided down so simply. We can be long advanced on some of the things that we say we're going to do. We can take them out of order in a positive way. And we've shown how it can be done with responsible nations like the people in this room, these incredible people in this room, setting aside their differences, seeking common ground and pursuing a better world for all of us. And that spirit's my dream that we all get together and enjoy our life. And we're going to put some of you on the Board of Peace. Everybody wants to be on the Board of Peace. They said, \"Would you be the chairman?\" I say, \"I'm pretty busy too.\" But, whatever we can do to have peace in the Middle East, it's worth it.\n\n(01:02:56)But, everybody wants to go on the Board of Peace, so we're probably going to enlarge it. We're going to get… And the leaders, the top people, the top leaders, they want to be on the Board of Peace. A beautiful term. At first, I wasn't sure, and then I realized how beautiful it is. And for the people of Gaza, the focus now must be on restoring the basics of a good life. We're going to have a lot of money coming into Gaza, and a lot of rebuilding and building. It's not so much rebuilding. It's really building, cleaning up, and building. And I'm pleased to announce that numerous countries of great wealth, and power, and dignity of come forward to me just today, and over the last week, to say they want to help in the reconstruction of Gaza putting up whatever money is necessary and the money is, of course, it's a lot of money, but it's not much compared to the value or the wealth of these tremendous countries.\n\n(01:03:48)And they are ensuring stability and success in the Middle East. So, when you think about it's a very, very small amount of money is necessary, relatively speaking. And as those commitments are made, I'm going to let the world know who is doing it, because they really deserve great credit for doing it, and they're going to do something that's really monumental. This is a monumental day. This is a monumental moment in the history of the world beyond the Middle East. We've all agreed that supporting Gaza must be done to lift up the people themselves, but we don't want to fund anything having to do with the bloodshed, hatred, or terror as has happened in the past. And for the same reason, we're also agreed that Gaza's reconstruction requires that it be demilitarized and that a new honest civilian police force must be allowed to create a safe condition for the people in Gaza.\n\n(01:04:48)As I said earlier, I intend to be a partner in securing a better future. We're going to be working… You're going to be working with the United States, and we're going to make sure that the Middle East is going to be a safe and secure place. It's a very important place in the world, means so much. So, many people who said the Middle East… And this has been going for many, many decades. I've read it many times, that World War III will begin in the Middle East. It's not going to happen. That's not going to happen. There was a time that you would've thought it could have, but it's not going to happen. There won't be World War III, hopefully at all, but it's not going to start in the Middle East. We're not going to have a World War III if we're smart.\n\n(01:05:26)Never be a World War III. Our work begins right here and right now. From ancient times, this region has been extraordinarily mixed with respect to people, culture, religions, all of the different elements of national characters unlike maybe anywhere else on Earth. And for 3,000 years there's been conflict, for whatever reason there's been tremendous conflict, always conflict. But today, for the first time anyone can remember, we have a once-in-a-lifetime chance to put the old feuds and bitter hatreds behind us. And that's why so many people in this room, they didn't get along. Some did, some didn't. But, they're getting along now. This has brought the people together. This is the first time the Middle East crisis has brought people together as opposed to driving them apart, and to declare that our future will not be ruled by the fights of the generations past, which is foolish.\n\n(01:06:24)So, together let us continue in the spirit of cooperation and goodwill that has finally brought us to this incredible historic breakthrough. If we do together, we will reach the Middle East's incredible destiny, a safe, and prosperous, and beautiful crossroads of culture and commerce, faith in humanity and geographic center. This will be the geographic center of the world. So, I just want to thank everybody for being here. I want to thank you all for what you've done, and for this quick, quick notice, it all came together just at one little period it just came together. The greatest deals happened that way. If you do anything about deals, that's all I've done all my life is deals. The greatest deals just sort of happen. And that's what happened right here. And maybe this is going to be the greatest deal of them all.\n\n(01:07:16)Not just nation-building, not just having to do with this or the political whims. This will be maybe the greatest deal of them all, period. And I want to thank all of you, and all of these great nations, and this region for what it's gone through and all of the fights it's had, life over death, and hope over strife, and harmony over hatred. That's what we want. We want it to be that way, because together we're going to forge a magnificent, great, and enduring peace. I want to just end by saying, God bless you all. God bless the Middle East. God bless your countries. And God bless you. Thank you very much everybody. Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you.\n\n(01:08:06)Thank you very much. So, if we could ask the media to leave and we're going to have a little conversation with all of these great leaders. It will take five minutes. And we'll just talk for a couple of minutes. But, if we could ask the media to leave would be great. Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 11 (01:08:34):\n\nThanks.\n\nSpeaker 9 (01:08:34):\n\nSo, you're going back?\n\nSpeaker 11 (01:08:36):\n\nI'll go back eventually.

Are you okay?\n\nSpeaker 12 (01:08:59):\n\n[inaudible 01:08:59].\n\n(01:08:59)I will be in Washington in 8th of November.\n\nSpeaker 9 (01:08:59):\n\nCome over.

    "transcript": "Speaker 1 (00:01):\n\nI would like to thank the head of the opposition-\n\nSpeaker 2 (00:03):\n\nMembers of the Knesset-\n\nSpeaker 1 (00:03):\n\n… members of the Knesset-\n\nSpeaker 2 (00:06):\n\n… it is now my distinct honor to invite the president of the United States of America, His Excellency, Donald J. Trump, to address The Knesset.\n\nPresident Trump (00:19):\n\nThank you very much. Thank you. Thank you very much, everybody. It's a great honor. Nice place. Very nice place. Mr. President, Mr. Prime Minister, Mr. Speaker, esteemed members of the Knesset and cherished citizens of Israel. We gather on a day of profound joy, of soaring hope of renewed faith, and above all, a day to give our deepest thanks to the Almighty God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob. After two harrowing years in darkness and captivity, 20 courageous hostages are returning to the glorious embrace of their families and it is glorious. 28 more precious loved ones are coming home, at last, to rest in this sacred soil for all of time. And after so many years of unceasing war and endless danger, today the skies are calm, the guns are silent, the sirens are still, and the sun rises on a holy land that is finally at peace. A land and a region that will live, God willing, in peace for all eternity.\n\n(02:26)This is not only the end of a war, this is the end of a age of terror and death and the beginning of the age of faith and hope and of God. It's the start of a grand concord and lasting harmony for Israel and all the nations of what will soon be a truly magnificent region. I believe that so strongly. This is the historic dawn of a new Middle East. I want to express my gratitude to a man of exceptional courage and patriotism whose partnership did so much to make this momentous day possible. You know who I'm talking about? There's only one, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Bibi, please stand up. And he is not easy, I want to tell you. He's not the easiest guy to deal with, but that's what makes him great. That's what makes him great. Thank you very much, Bibi. Great job.\n\n(04:06)And let me also convey my tremendous appreciation for all of the nations of the Arab and Muslim world that came together to press Hamas to set the hostages free and to send them home. We had a lot of help. We had a lot of help from a lot of people that you wouldn't suspect, and I want to thank them very much for that. It's an incredible triumph for Israel and the world to have all of these nations working together as partners in peace. And it's pretty unusual for you to see that, but it happened in this case. This was a very unusual point in time, a brilliant point in time.\n\n(04:45)Generations from now, this will be remembered as the moment that everything began to change and change very much for the better. Like the USA right now, it'll be the golden age of Israel and the golden age of the Middle East, it's going to work together. I'd like to thank several great American patriots for their invaluable help in getting something done that almost everyone thought was absolutely impossible, we were wasting our time. So, many people said, \"You're just wasting your time,\" but we weren't because we had talented people working with us and we people that loved your country and frankly, people that love the region, they love the Middle East.\n\n(05:31)I want to thank my friend Steve Witkoff. Steve was chosen by me, he never did this before, but I knew him as a few things. He was a great businessman, but I know a lot of great businessmen, to be honest with you. He had tremendous negotiating skills, but I know a lot of people that negotiate pretty well, although it is an art. But there are people that can negotiate pretty well. But most importantly with Steve, he's just a great guy. Everybody loved him, everybody. I mean, I know some negotiators that are so good, but you wouldn't have had peace in the Middle East. You would be in World War III right now with some of these guys. Everybody loves Steve and they respect him and they somehow can relate to him. I've known him for many years and I've seen it over and over again.\n\nSpeaker 2 (06:54):\n\n[foreign language 00:06:58].\n\nSpeaker 1 (07:03):\n\nPlease expel this Knesset member.\n\nSpeaker 2 (07:05):\n\n[foreign language 00:07:06].\n\nSpeaker 1 (07:05):\n\nPlease expel this Knesset Member Cassif out of the hall. Please expel him immediately.\n\nSpeaker 2 (07:37):\n\nSorry for that, Mr. President.\n\nPresident Trump (07:38):\n\nThank you. That was very efficient. So, back to Steve, he's… But I tell one story because he was so involved, and then we called in Jared, we need that brain on occasion. We got to get Jared in here. We got to get a certain group of people, but Steve started this all by himself. I call him Henry Kissinger, who doesn't leak, okay? Henry is a big leaker. He leaked. Steve doesn't leak. Steve just wants to get the job done. He wants to do what's right.\n\n(08:39)But I'll give you just a quick story because as you know, he's working on the war with Russia and Ukraine. A war that would've never happened if I were president, a shame. 7,000 young soldiers a week are being killed, more than that this last week. It's a shame. Should have never happened, but it did happen. And we won the race, and I took over this horrible war that's been raging and I thought it would be easily settled. I thought it was a hell of a lot easier than doing what we just did very successfully with Israel and a lot of other people, but this came first and we'll get that one.\n\n(09:21)But I set up a meeting for him to meet with President Putin, thinking it would be a 15 or a 20-minute meeting. Steve had no idea about Russia, had no idea about Putin too much, didn't know too much about politics, wasn't that interested. He was really good at real estate, but he had that quality that I was looking for, and I didn't see it around in too many ways. And I set up the meeting with Putin and I called. I said, \"Is Steve finished yet?\" That was about a half an hour into the meeting. \"No, sir. He's not. He's still inside.\" This is in Moscow. I said, \"Well, how's he doing?\" \"I don't know, sir. He's still inside.\" I called up an hour later, \"Let me speak to Steve.\" \"Sir, he's still with Putin. He's with President Putin.\" I said, \"Wow, that's a long meeting, one hour.\" I called up an hour later, he was still with Putin. Three hours later, he was still with Putin. Four hours later, he started to get the word that he was going to be coming out soon. And in five hours, he came out.\n\n(10:20)I said, \"What the hell were you talking about for five hours?\" And he says, \"Just a lot of interesting things. We are talking about a lot of interesting things,\" including what he went in there for, but you can't talk about it for five… You could talk about it for a certain period of time and you know what you're getting. But that's a talent. That's a talent where you can do that. Most people I'd send in, number one, they wouldn't be accepted. Number two, if they were, the meeting would last five minutes. And that's what happens with Steve. Everybody loves him, they love him on this side, they love him on the other side. And he really is, he's a great negotiator because he's a great guy. So, thank you very much, Steve. Very much.\n\n(11:20)And let me also give a very special thanks to someone who truly loves Israel. In fact, loves it so much that my daughter converted. My daughter converted. I didn't know this was going to happen. And Ivanka's here. And Bibi, you do know this was not in the cards for me. You understand that. And she is so happy and they are so happy, at least I think they're happy. If they're not, we have a big story, right? No, they have a great marriage and they get along great. They're best friends. They have a very special relationship. But Jared has been so helpful. He really did something very special. He established the Abraham Accords with a group of very wonderful people. I like calling it the Avraham Accords because people that… Right? Avraham, it's so cool. It's so much nicer. The Abraham versus the Avraham. I just don't want to sound too sanctimonious when I do it, so I split it up. This way, I keep everybody happy.\n\n(13:10)But we have some very great talent and they have no excuses for anything that's taken place because we had some unbelievably good people working on this. And then, you're going to add a man named Marco Rubio, who he's also here. That's right. And I have a prediction that Marco will go down, I mean this, as the greatest secretary of state in the history of the United States. I believe that. I believe it. And he and I, we really fought it out. You remember, he was tough. He was nasty. Who the hell thought this was going to happen, Marco, right? And now, I'm saying he's going to go down as the greatest, he will. He was always smart and sharp and people respect him.\n\n(14:28)And then, we have somebody who's young, but an unbelievable leader. I saw it a long time ago. And he's turned out to be even better than we thought. Right, Suzy? I think even better. And that's Pete Hegseth, who is our secretary of war, formerly secretary of defense. And as you know, we decisively won World War I, we decisively won World War Two, decisively, and everything in between and everything before it, we won everything. And then, they had the brilliant idea of changing the name from war, it was war, to defense. And with that went a certain thinking, and we fought in a very politically correct way after that.\n\n(15:32)We always had the strongest military. And now, we have a stronger military than we've ever had before. Because of my first term. I've totally rebuilt the military, every aspect of it. But you think we settled eight wars in eight months. I'm now including this one, by the way, if that's okay. They may say, \"Well, that was quick,\" because yesterday I was saying seven, but now I can say eight. The hostages are back. The hostages are back. It is a good feeling. Isn't that nice to say? The first time I said, \"The hostages are back.\" It feels so good to say it, but when you settle eight wars in eight months, that means you don't like war.\n\n(16:41)Everyone thought I was going to be brutal. In fact, I remember Hillary Clinton during a debate, she said, \"Look at him. Look at him. He's going to go war with everybody.\" And actually, she said, \"He's got a personality that's all about war.\" No, my personality actually is all about stopping wars and it seems to\n\nPresident Trump (17:00):\n\nWork seems to work. But, it also means this name change and our attitude that … We're not going to go into a war, but if we do we're going to win that war like nobody has ever won a war before. We will not be politically correct, but we're not going to be there. And I think as you mentioned, Bibi before, peace through strength. And that's what it's all about. The United States has the greatest and most powerful military in the, right now, history of the world. I can tell you, we have weapons that nobody's ever dreamt of. I only hope we never have to use them. I rebuilt the military. I was proud to do it, but some of the things I hated to do. I hated certain of the weapons because the level of power is so enormous, it's so dangerous, so bad. But we have to do what we have to do. We make the best weapons in the world, and we've got a lot of them. And we've given a lot to Israel, frankly. Bibi would call me so many times, can you get me this weapon? That weapon, that weapon? Some of them I never heard of, Bibi, and I made them. But, we'd get them here, wouldn't we? And they are the best. They are the best. But, you used them well. It also takes people to know how to use them, and you obviously used them very well. But, so many that Israel became strong and powerful, which ultimately led to peace. That's what led to peace. As we celebrate today, let us remember how this nightmare of depravity and death all began. Two years ago on the eve of the Simchat Torah holiday, thousands of innocent Israeli civilians were attacked by terrorists, and one of the most evil and heinous desecrations of innocent life the world has ever seen, the worst slaughter of Jews since the Holocaust, the cruelty of October 7th struck to the core of humanity itself. Nobody could believe what they were witnessing. The United States of America grieved alongside you, and we mourned for our own citizens who were so viciously taken that day. And to all the families whose lives were forever changed by the atrocities of that day, and all of the people of Israel, please know that America joins you in those two everlasting vows. Never forget and never again. From October 7th until this week, Israel has been a nation at war, enduring burdens that only a proud and faithful people could withstand. It was a very tough period of time. For so many families across this land, it has been years since you've known a single day of true peace. But, now at last, not only for Israelis, but also for Palestinians, and for many others, the long and painful nightmare is finally over. And as the dust settles, the smoke fades, the debris is removed, and the ashes clean from the air the day that breaks on a region transformed, and a beautiful and much brighter future appears suddenly within your reach. This is now a very exciting time for Israel and for the entire Middle East, because all across the Middle East, the forces of chaos, terror, and ruin that have plagued the region for decades now stand weakened, isolated, and totally defeated. A new coalition of proud and responsible nations is emerging. And because of us, the enemies of all civilization are in retreat. Thanks to the bravery and incredible skill of the Israeli Defense Forces and Operation Rising Lion.\n\n(22:02)The guy's central casting, let's put him in a movie, look at him. Great job. And my people loved working with you. Loved it. They work so well together. But, many of Iran's top terrorists, including nuclear scientists and commanders, have been extinguished from this earth. And with Operation Midnight Hammer, boy, that's a great name for that what we did. Bless you. The United States military flew seven of those beautiful B-II bombers. They look so beautiful all of a sudden. They were always … I thought they were pretty planes. I had no idea they could do what they did. In fact, we just ordered 28 more of them. A little updated version, we ordered a whole pile of them, and almost 100 other planes went with them, including fighter jets. We had 52 tankers, big, beautiful, brand-new tankers that were loading them up four or five times. They've traveled 37 hours back and forth. Think of that.\n\n(23:38)But we had tankers all over the sky for all the other planes. We had the F-22, the F-35s, F-16. We had a hell of a lot of planes. We had 52 gas stations in the sky. That's what they call them. I'll tell you, I wouldn't want to be flying one of them. We have our great general Raizin Cane right here, general stand up. This guy. What a general. Thank you.\n\n(24:12)I asked General Kane, I said, \"You know we're having problems with ISIS,\" and I was in Washington, and I asked, \"How long would it take to defeat ISIS?\" And my Washington Generals told me, \"Three, four, maybe five years, sir.\" I said, \"I don't get it. We got the best equipment in the world. Why?\" I flew to Iraq, and I met with a man named Kane. He said, \"What's your first name?\" He said, \"They call me Raizin, sir.\" I said, \"Wait a minute. Your name is Raizin Cane\" I've been looking for you for a long time. You got to be kidding.\"\n\n(25:05)They told me three, four or five years to defeat ISIS. And I sit down with him and I say, \"Why is it\" … I flew there in the dark of night. I landed, I'll never forget it. It was quite a trip. I'm glad I made it. I met him. I said, \"Could I ask you general\" … I come down, he studied with another general and a sergeant. Everybody was like central casting. They could go into a movie right now, between him and you guys over here. We could get rich making movies, okay? And they got along so great. That's the beautiful thing that your military and our military, Bibi, got along so great.\n\n(25:42)But, I was told by the television generals in Washington, we have the best equipment in the world. Why is it taking so long? And they said four years. I said, \"So let me ask you, Raizin, how long would it take you to defeat ISIS?\" \"Sir, we can do it in three weeks, but you'll probably have some time left over.\" I said, \"You got to be kidding. What the hell are you talking about? They said, four years.\" He said, \"Well, sir, look, it's not my place to say, but you're asking me the question. What you have to do is you hit him from the west, you hit him from the north, you hit him from the south. You hit him above. You hit him below.\" I said, \"So why didn't they do it?\" And he didn't want to speak badly of his superiors, which is hard to believe they were his superiors. Should have been the other way around a long time ago, because he's the one that did operation … It was flawless. It was flawless. It was absolutely flawless.\n\n(26:48)And I said, \"So you really think you can do it in four weeks?\" \"Yes, sir, 100%. You have to do it differently than they were doing it. They were using one base and it was hundreds of miles away.\" And he says, \"We have all these portable bases all over the Middle East, and they didn't want to use them because they didn't want to offend the country where the portable … They wouldn't have even known what the hell the planes were going up, right? They wouldn't have known.\"\n\n(27:12)But he said, \"No, they didn't want to defend anybody, offend anybody, but we can do it in four weeks.\" And I said, \"You sure about that? I'm going to call you back. I'll call you back on Monday. I'm going back to Washington. But, you think four weeks?\" \"Yes, sir. I think we can do it in four weeks. We'll have time left over.\" I call him on Monday, I say, \"You think you can do it four weeks?\" I said, \"Go ahead and do it.\" He did it. I'll tell you, he did it in four weeks, less than four weeks. General, stand up, please.\n\n(27:43)Again, this is a real general, this is not a television general. He doesn't want to go on television. He doesn't want to go on television. I said the other guys love being on television. We dropped 14 bombs on Iran's key nuclear facilities, totally, as I said, originally obliterating them. And that's been confirmed, and everybody understands it. Together, we stopped the number one state sponsor of terror from obtaining the world's most dangerous weapons. And if you think about it, if we didn't do that, and assuming we made the same deal that we have today, there'd be a dark cloud over this deal. And number one, it wouldn't happen because the other Arab and Muslim nations really wouldn't feel comfortable making the deal that we have now, right? If Iran had that nuclear weapon that they were about two months away from having, they would've had it in two months, or maybe less than that. They were right. This was our last shot. They looked at it for 22 years. This was our last shot.\n\n(28:59)The pilots told me that. They said, \"22 years, sir.\" They looked at it. Our predecessors looked. They studied it. Three times a year, would do drills on that exact attack. And boy, did they get it right. But, let's assume they didn't. And let's assume there was large-scale nuclear weapons in the hands of Iran. We couldn't be here today. Even if we signed the deal, which we couldn't do because a lot of people would not want to have anything to do with it. We took a big cloud off of the Middle East and off of Israel.\n\n(29:49)And it was my honor to help. But, isn't it true though that … Can you imagine the same? Let's assume, Bibi, the same documents, we had everything the same. But, you had somebody out there that was in the opinion of everybody all powerful in the Middle East. They took a big hit, didn't they? Didn't they take a big hit? Boy, oh boy, they got it from one side, from the other. And you know what would be great if we could make a peace deal with them. And I think that's big. Wouldn't you be happy with that? Wouldn't it be nice, I think, because I think they want to. I think they're tired. Somebody said, \"Sir, they're starting their nuclear program again.\" I said, \"Let me tell you something. They're not starting anything. They want to survive. The last thing they want to do is start digging holes again in mountains that just got blown up, and start … They're not doing … They want to survive, okay?\"\n\n(30:47)But, I think we have a chance. Steve, you and I think Jared, come on. I'll call you back for another one. We always bring Jared, when we want to get that deal closed. We bring Jared, but Steve, you and Jared, and the general, and Pete, and Marco, you'll get that deal done easy. I think that'll be easy. But, first, we have to get Russia done. We got to get that one done. If you don't mind, Steve, let's focus on Russia first, all right? We'll get it done. In Lebanon, the dagger of Hezbollah long aimed at Israel's throat has been totally shattered. My administration is actively supporting the new president of Lebanon and his mission to permanently disarm Hezbollah's terror brigades.\n\n(31:33)He's doing very well, and build a thriving state at peace with its neighbors, and you're very much in favor of that I know, and good things are happening there, really good things. And with this week's ceasefire, we've achieved the most challenging breakthrough of them all. The most challenging breakthrough maybe ever. I've never seen anything like … I've been involved in a lot of success. I have never seen anything like what's going on today all over the world. People are dancing in the streets, not just in Israel. They're dancing in the streets of countries that would've never danced in the street about what's happening today. They're dancing in those streets.\n\n(32:18)This long and difficult war has now ended. Some people say 3,000 years, some people say 500 years. Whatever it is, it's the granddaddy of them all. And in an unprecedented achievement, virtually the entire region has endorsed the plan that Gaza will be immediately demilitarized, that Hamas will be disarmed, and Israel's security will no longer be threatened in any way, shape, or form. Israel, with our help, has won all that they can. By force of arms, you've won, you've won. Now, it's time to translate these victories against terrorists on the battlefield into the ultimate prize of peace and prosperity for the entire Middle East. It's about time you were able to enjoy the fruits of your labor. Mr. Opposition Leader, he's a very nice Opposition Leader, I think … No, he's a nice man. Bibi, he's a nice man. Good. He knows what he's doing, right? No, a very nice guy. Well, see, now you can be a little bit nicer, Bibi, because you're not at war anymore, Bibi.\n\nPresident Trump (34:01):\n\nBut only by embracing the opportunities of this moment can we achieve our goal of ensuring that the horrors of recent years will never happen again. You don't want to have to go through this again. Eight years ago, I came to this region on a very special first trip abroad as the President of the United States. I came here very early at your request.\n\n(34:22)I addressed the leaders of the Arab and Muslim world gathered in Saudi Arabia and said that it was time to build a future free of the grip of extremism and terror. And I'm interestingly, right now, as soon as I'm finished, I'm quite late. You've kept me quite late between opposition leaders and Bibi's brilliant, but very long speech. I thought I was going to run up here, make a speech, and then head to Egypt. It didn't work out though, and you made a pretty long one too, Sarah, but I liked what you all said. It could be worse. Supposing, on top of it, I didn't like what you said, that would be no good, Ron, would it? Ron, you did a great job, by the way, Ron. So I'm going to be meeting actually in a little while, I'm going to be meeting with the most powerful, the richest nations really in the world, although now with the tariffs, the United States is by far the richest nation in the world, as you probably have been reading. But the richest nations, most powerful nations, tremendous, headed by some tremendous people in many cases. Some cases, I wouldn't say necessarily I would endorse, but I will tell you some incredible people that really helped us make this all possible.\n\n(36:02)So I'll be going there. I'll be quite late. They might not be there by the time I get there, but we're going to give it a shot. But the journey we started back then led to the crushing defeat of the ISIS caliphate, to the monumental Abraham Accords, and ultimately to the historic ceasefire this week in which many of those same nations really played a very pivotal role.\n\n(36:27)I have to tell you, Steve will tell you that, Jared will tell you that. Together we've shown that peace is not just a hope that we can dream about, it's a reality we can build upon day by day, person by person and nation by nation. And because of that, the Middle East is finally ready to embrace its extraordinary potential. You have extraordinary potential in this region. It should now be clear to everyone throughout the region that decades of fomenting terrorism and extremism, jihadism and anti-Semitism have not worked. They haven't worked. They've been a disaster. They've just killed. They've killed. They've backfired completely and totally.\n\n(37:15)They've just totally backfired. Everything that you thought, take it worst case, it's turned out to be worse than that. They have not worked. From Gaza to Iran, those bitter hatreds have delivered nothing but misery, suffering, failure and death. They've served not to weaken Israel, but to annihilate the very forces that did the most to foment this hatred.\n\n(37:43)And it's really, I mean, everybody that's tried it has become irrelevant. Meanwhile, we've seen those nations that set aside their differences reached across ancient divides and pursued engagement are now among the most successful in the region. They're getting along with Israel and they're doing great. And I can tell you, the four nations that joined the Abraham Accords early on, and you'd all be doing me a favor, and I'm going to be saying this in a little while to some other friends, would love you all to, is this right, Jared, join up in the Abraham Accords.\n\n(38:25)We have to join up and get together. You can have that whole thing filled out. We had a very weak administration, worst president in the history of our country by far. And Barack Obama was not far behind, by the way.\n\n(38:40)And they did nothing with this incredible document, the Abraham Accords. But now you can fill them up. Now you have peace, you have people that really like Israel, I'll tell you what, and they like Israel a lot more today than they did even five weeks ago. You've come back. You've come back strong because it was getting to be a little nasty out there in the world. And ultimately the world wins. You can't beat the world, or I would say to Bibi, \"Bibi, it's now time.\" And he understood it better than anybody because ultimately the world's a very big place.\n\n(39:23)And I've said a lot. I said, \"This piece of land is very small. It's unbelievable, you know with that tiny, you look at a map even of just not the world, the Middle East, and you have this little dot and think of what you've done. It's incredible. It's incredible.\"\n\n(39:39)But the world is loving Israel again. And I said to him, \"Bibi, the world is big and it's strong.\" And Ron, ultimately the world wins. And we don't have to worry about that now. But there was getting to be a period of time over the last few months, the world wanted peace and Israel wanted peace. Everybody did. Everybody did. And what a victory it's been, right? What a victory it's been.\n\n(40:26)If you would've gone on for three, four more years, keep fighting, fighting, fighting, it was getting bad. It was getting heated. The timing of this is brilliant. And I said, \"Bibi, you're going to be remembered for this far more than if you kept this thing going, going, going, kill, kill, kill.\" It would not be the same. And I just want to congratulate you for having the courage to say, \"That's it. We've won, and now let's enjoy our lives and let's rebuild Israel and make it stronger and bigger and better than it's ever been before.\"\n\n(41:03)You're going to do that. Took a lot of guts. And the choice for Palestinians could not be more clear. This is their chance to turn forever from the path of terror and violence, it's been extreme, to exile the wicked forces of hate that are in their midst. And I think that's going to happen, we've had some people over the last couple of months that want to see it happen very much. And after tremendous pain and death and hardship, now is the time to concentrate on building their people up instead of trying to tear Israel down. We don't want that to happen again.\n\n(41:48)And the total focus of Gazans must be on restoring the fundamentals of stability, safety, dignity and economic development so they can finally have the better life that their children really do deserve after all these decades of horror. I intend to be a partner in this effort, in the sense that we're going to help and we're going to do something that became unbelievably popular. Everybody wants to be on it. It's called the Board of Peace, okay? How about that? Is that a beautiful name?\n\n(42:20)Like a Board of Peace. The only bad thing from my standpoint, every single nation involved has asked me to be the chair. And I'll tell you, I'm very busy. I didn't count on that. But you know what, if we do it, we'll do it right. And we have unbelievable power and wealth because you're going to need wealth. You're going to need wealth to rebuild things.\n\n(42:49)And they have wealth like few people have wealth. I want to thank the Arab and Muslim nations for their commitment that they've made to support a safe rebuilding of Gaza and beyond. I have many Arab countries, very wealthy countries that came up and said, \"We'll put up tremendous amounts of money to rebuild Gaza.\" And I think that's going to happen. The power, they want dignity. They want to come forward and they want to say and I want to say who they are because what they're doing is going to be, I think something that you're going to be very impressed with, Bibi. And you need that.\n\n(43:28)You need the kind of economic power that they have and they want to see it work, and they want to see it be safe, and they want to see it be good for Israel too. And as much money as it will be, and it's a lot, as you can see, it's a lot, for these countries it's relatively little relative to their worth. It's really a lot of money, money most people could never even conceive. But for these countries, it's not that much, especially because it ensures success and stability in the Middle East, which is what they want to see.\n\n(44:07)So many of them will be with us in Egypt in a little while, I think. I'm not sure. They may be gone. They may have taken their Boeing 747s and left.\n\n(44:20)I said, \"What kind of a plane do you fly?\" \"A 747.\" I said, \"That's a large plane.\" No, they may have… Steve, do you think they've left on their brand-new Boeing 747? I don't know. We're going to find out soon. It's going to be a big story. There'll be two people left and they'll be the two poorest ones, but it will be the wealthiest and most powerful group of nations. So the group that we have assembled, that's waiting for us, is the wealthiest and most powerful group ever assembled at one time.\n\n(45:02)There has never been a group like this. And they're only looking for good. They want good. They're going to do good. And as those commitments are made, I'm going to let the world know who's doing it because they really deserve to get the credit. And some of them probably won't want the credit, but they deserve it. It's more obvious than ever that the productive and responsible nations of this region should not be enemies or adversaries. You should be partners and eventually even friends. And that's what's going to happen. I know it. Together you can stand against the forces of chaos… Yeah, you go ahead. That's an important point.\n\n(45:45)Because you can stand against the forces of chaos that threatened all of your interests, and it's always a big threat, always a big threat, and unleash incredible prosperity and opportunity for all the people of these lands. And that's what's going to happen. You're going to unleash numbers and success the likes of which Israel has never been able to think of because you're so firm and you should be, and you've done the right thing in defending yourself.\n\n(46:13)You're not going to have to worry so much about it. You've won, and now you can build and you can do things that you never even thought possible. When you put that genius into doing something else, it's going to be a miracle. The miracle in the desert, it's going to be amazing, and it already is in a true sense. But it'll be wonderful when you can spend time thinking about other than war and defense and offense also. To that end, it's my firm hope and dream, frankly, that together the Abraham Accords will turn out to be everything that we thought they would. Those four countries were very, very brave in doing it. They did it at a very early point, and every single one of them benefits unbelievably financially. And if you noticed, even in this bad period that we just went through, they all remained a member of the Abraham Accords. They've done unbelievably well, and you know who you are and I want to thank you.\n\n(47:13)And they've stayed because of loyalty, but they've also stayed because it was really good business. They've made a lot of money being members. And you're going to all, I think, I hope that every one of the countries that we're seeking, Jared, I hope they join quickly, no games, no nothing. Just join. Get it. It's going to be a great peacemaker. It's really going to bring it together beyond anybody's wildest dream. So instead of building fortresses to keep enemies at bay, the nations of this region should be building infrastructure to weave your commerce closer together, because you've got to compete with a big world out there on commerce now, it's a different kind of competition.\n\n(47:59)Instead of making weapons and missiles, the wealth of this region should flow to schools and medicine industry. And frankly, the new hot thing, artificial intelligence.\n\n(48:14)Boy, it's a lot of intelligence you're going to have to be throwing off to pay back these sums of money that they're doing. But that's really the hot one. And I might say that the United States, a year ago was a dead country. I say it to people, I heard it first from the king of Saudi Arabia. I then heard it from UAE. I heard it from Qatar. I heard it from many other countries. A year ago, the United States of America was a dead country. Now it's the hottest country anywhere in the world. It is the hottest. There's no question about it.\n\n(48:54)In fact, if you go back a year ago before the election, although once we had November 5th, we became hot because people got it. I would say November 5th was a time that we became really hot. But once you go back a couple of years, if I were in charge and the country was doing what… Nobody was going to ask me to speak. Nobody asked Joe Biden to come up and speak, I guarantee you that. And if they did, he would've turned them down. I promise you. He didn't speak and he didn't speak well.\n\n(49:22)But all of the countries in the Middle East could have, what we're doing now, it could have happened a long time ago, but it was strangled and set back, almost irretrievably by the administrations of Barack Obama and then Joe Biden. There was a hatred toward Israel. There was an absolute hatred. The setbacks really started when President Obama signed the Iran nuclear deal. This was a disaster for Israel, and it was a disaster for everyone. And I remember that Bibi Netanyahu came to the United States and worked so hard to try and get Obama not to do that deal.\n\n(50:10)He worked so hard, but it was like talking to a wall. I remember him telling me, it was like talking to a wall. They wanted to go with Iran. They chose Iran, frankly, over a lot of other good nations, but specifically Israel. And that was the beginning of a very bad period of time.\n\n(50:31)You had Obama go out and the Iran nuclear deal turned out to be a disaster. And by the way, I terminated the Iran nuclear deal, and I was very proud to do it. Yet even to Iran, whose regime has inflicted\n\nPresident Trump (51:00):\n\n… so much death on the Middle East. The hand of friendship and cooperation is open. I'm telling you, they want to make a deal. That's all I do in my life, I make deals. I'm good at it, I've always been good at it, and I know when they want. Even if they said, \"We don't want to make a deal.\" I can tell you they want to make a deal. All right? They do. They want to make a deal, and we're going to see if we can do something because this is crazy what's happening and we're not going to have this anymore.\n\n(51:27)Neither the United States nor Israel bear the people of Iran any hostility. We merely want to live in peace. We don't want any looming threats over our heads, and we don't want to even think in terms of nuclear destruction. It's not going to happen, never will happen. There's nothing that would do more good for this part of the world than for Iran's leaders to renounce terror, stop threatening their neighbors, quit funding their militant proxies, and finally recognize Israel's right to existence. They have to do that. They have to do that.\n\n(52:00)And to Iran, and as you know, this is not said out of weakness, there's no weakness, but I'm going to say this, that we are ready when you are, and it will be the best decision that Iran has ever made. And it's going to happen. It's going to happen. And they're good people. I know a lot of Iranians in the United States, they're good people, smart, hardworking people. They don't want to see what's happened to their country.\n\n(52:33)The story of fierce Israeli resolve and triumph since October 7th should be proof to the entire world that those who seek to destroy this nation are doomed to bitter failure. The state of Israel is strong and it will live and thrive forever. And that is why Israel will always remain a vital ally of the United States of America. Israelis share our values, field one of the world's most powerful militaries. You really do. You have an amazing … What a job, what a job you've done. And have one of the most innovative economies on earth. Those are just a few of the reasons why I'm proud to be the best friend that Israel has ever had. And they all say it in the White House, they all say it. I guess it's true because everybody says it. Bibi, you said it today, thank you.\n\n(53:45)But as president, I terminated the disastrous Iran nuclear deal, and ultimately, I terminated Iran's nuclear program with things called B2 bombers. It was swift and it was accurate, and it was a military beauty. I authorized the spending of billions of dollars, which went to Israel's defense, as you know. And after years of broken promises from many other American presidents … You know that, they kept promising. I never understood it until I got there. There was a lot of pressure put on these presidents. It was put on me too, but I didn't yield to the pressure.\n\n(54:27)But every president for decades said, \"We're going to do it.\" The difference is I kept my promise and officially recognized the capital of Israel and moved the American Embassy to Jerusalem. Isn't that right, Miriam? Look at Miriam. She's back there. Stand up, Miriam. Stand up. Miriam and Sheldon would come into the office, they'd call me, he'd call me … I think they had more trips to the White House than anybody else I can think of. Look at her sitting there so innocently. She's got 60 billion in the bank, 60 billion. I think she's saying, \"No, more.\" And she loves Israel, but she loves it.\n\n(55:34)And they would come in … And her husband was a very aggressive man, but I loved him. He was a very aggressive … Very supportive of me. And he'd call up, \"Can I come over and see you?\" I'd say, \"Sheldon, I'm the president of the United States. It doesn't work that way.\" He'd come in. He would, though. But they were very responsible for so much, including getting me thinking about Golan Heights, which is probably one of the greatest things to ever happen to Israel.\n\n(56:15)Miriam, stand up please. She really is … I mean, she loves this country. She loves this country. Her and her husband are so incredible. We miss him so dearly. I'm going to get her in trouble with this, but I actually asked her once, I said, \"So, Miriam, I know you love Israel. What do you love more, the United States or Israel?\" She refused to answer. That might mean Israel. I must say. We love you. Thank you, darling, for being here. That's a great honor. Great honor. She's a wonderful woman. She is a great woman.\n\n(56:59)I've always stood for the people of this community, and I always will. I'll always be with you. I'm always going to be with you. I guess, maybe something could happen to changed my mind, somebody that's really stupid gets into office and wants to do really bad things, but that's about it. We don't think we're going to have that happen. I hope we're not going to have that happen.\n\n(57:19)And this man is a good man right here. These two men are good men right here. Hey, I have an idea. Mr. President, why don't you give him a pardon? Give him a pardon. Come on. By the way, that was not in the speech, as you probably know, but I to like this gentleman right over here, and it just seems to make so much sense. Whether we like it or not, this has been one of the greatest wartime presidents. This has been one of the greatest wartime presidents. And cigars and champagne, who the hell cares about that? All right, enough controversy for the day, right? Actually, I don't think it's very controversial. I see, so popular. You are a very popular man. You know why? Because you know how to win.\n\nSpeaker 3 (59:17):\n\nBibi. Bibi. Bibi. Bibi.\n\nPresident Trump (59:33):\n\nOver the past two years, I've met many of the families of the Israelis taken hostage and those that were taken hostage, unbelievable. I've looked into their eyes, I've seen the worst nightmares of their suffering, but I've also seen something else, the beautiful love of the people. The love of people, frankly, that hold things together. The love that gives you the courage to carry on through thousands of years of persecution and repression, and to emerge with the heart of David. It's the heart of David. It's that love that's defeated the enemies of civilization, built this incredible country, and this unbelievable economy, and forged one of the great democracies of the world. That is why it's a true honor to stand here today and address this assembly in your ancient and eternal now capital, Jerusalem. I'm proud to have helped in that regard. This city and this nation stand as living proof that a much brighter future for this entire region is truly within our grasp. For thousands of years, Jerusalem has been a home to Christians, Jews, Muslims, and people of all ethnicities and creeds. This is the holy center of the world's three great Abrahamic faiths. I like that too. It's the first time I've seen that word in a while. Adorned with their sacred sites and alive with their pilgrims and visitors from every corner of the globe. But here between the Western Wall, the Temple Mount, and the hill called Calvary, people of every faith and background, live, work, pray, serve, and raise their family side by side, and they do it with love. This example is just one of the modern miracles that Israel has given to the world.\n\n(01:01:31)And just in closing, the leaders in this chamber know better than anyone else the challenges of disharmony, and it's been easily won. No, it hasn't. It has not been. It's been so tough, but it has been, some say, a miracle. What you've done is a miracle. Look at your size. Look at your chances when it all started. And if you think about it, you are safer today, stronger today, and more respected today than at any time in the history of Israel. Think of it.\n\n(01:02:16)People used to say it wouldn't exist. They don't say that anymore, do they? Yet if safety, security, and coexistence can thrive here in the winding alleys and ancient paths of Jerusalem, then surely peace and respect can flourish among the nations of the broader Middle East. The God who once dwelled among his people in this city still calls us in the words of Scripture, the turn from evil and do good to seek peace and pursue it. So, he still whispers truth into the hills and knolls and valleys of his magnificent creation. And he still writes hope into the hearts of his children all over the world. And that is why even after 3,000 years of pain and conflict, the people of Israel have never given up from the threats of Zionism, from all sorts of threats. You want the promise of Zion. You want the promise of success and hope and love and God. And the people of America have never lost faith in the promise of a great and blessed future for all of us.\n\n(01:03:25)From the very first day that modern Israel was founded, we have stood together through thick and thin of setbacks, and through victory and defeat, through glory and heartache. We have built industries together, we have made discoveries together, we have confronted evil together, and we have waged war together, and perhaps most beautifully of all, we have made peace together. And this week, against all odds, we have done the impossible and brought our hostages home. So, now we're going to forge a future that is worthy of our heritage. We're going to build a legacy that all the people of this region can be proud of. New bonds of friendship, cooperation, and commerce will join Tel Aviv to Dubai, Haifa to Beirut, Jerusalem to Damascus, and from Israel to Egypt, from Saudi Arabia to Qatar, from India to Pakistan, from Indonesia to Iraq, from Syria to Bahrain, Turkey to Jordan, the United Arab Emirates to Oman and Armenia, to Azerbaijan, another war that I just settled. We are going to have hope, harmony, opportunity, and happiness here in the spiritual and geographic center of the entire world. That's what you are.\n\n(01:05:12)Israel, America, and all of the nations of the Middle East will soon be safer, stronger, greater and more prosperous than ever before. And I want to thank you all once again for this exceptional honor. This has been truly an honor. It's seldom that a president is invited to do this. And I love Israel. I'm with you all the way. You'll be bigger, better, stronger, and more loving than ever before. Thank you very much. God bless you. God bless the United States of America and God bless the Middle East. Thank you, everybody. Good luck. Thank you very much. Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 4 (01:06:00):\n\nThank you [inaudible 01:06:11].\n\nPresident Trump (01:06:00):\n\nThank you.\n\nSpeaker 3 (01:06:00):\n\n[inaudible 01:06:16].\n\nPresident Trump (01:06:40):\n\nThank you, everybody. Good luck. Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 5 (01:06:40):\n\nI'm thanking the president of the United States. The session is over.",

    "transcript": "President Alexander Stubb (00:00):\n\n… 2028.\n\nPresiden Trump (00:01):\n\nGood. Just a little bit before a big event.\n\nPresident Alexander Stubb (00:04):\n\nYeah.\n\nPresiden Trump (00:04):\n\n[inaudible 00:00:04] but that's great. And actually, it's true, I came here and they were building an icebreaker. They had no idea what they were doing. They had no idea how much it was going to cost. They knew nothing. And we have our Secretary of the Navy right over here, and we're working on a lot more than icebreakers. We're working on some very, very big and important ships.\n\n(00:25)But they had no idea what they were doing, and I was with you, and I ended up meeting you and knowing you. And I heard about Finland and their icebreakers, and I said, \"Do me a favor. Would you have your people take a look at what these people are doing?\" And it came out that, just as I thought, they had no idea what they were doing.\n\n(00:44)And we got involved and we need these ships very badly 'cause we have a lot of territory, more than anybody. And so, I'm very honored to have this deal, and thank you very much. It's going to be great. It's going to be a great partnership. And it's a great honor to have you Mr. prime Minister. Would you like to say something, please?\n\nPrime Minister Petteri Orpo (01:04):\n\nFirst, Mr. President, thank you very much. It's great honor to be here today. And as the Prime Minister of Finland, I want to say that this deal is, it's very important to in Finland and our economy, because our economy is suffering a lot because of Russian aggression in Ukraine and. This deal, it means investments, it means jobs, and jobs means hope. And that's why this is so important. And I want to thank your leadership on this deal and this issue. Thank you.\n\nPresiden Trump (01:31):\n\nSo you've been affected very badly by the war going on, the ridiculous war going on. Right?\n\nPrime Minister Petteri Orpo (01:36):\n\nYes. Because we have to close the border with Russia. We have 1,300 kilometers common border with them, and effects the atmosphere in Finland, in investments. And that's why we need good news. Our people need hope.\n\nPresiden Trump (01:52):\n\nRight. So your border is closed?\n\nPrime Minister Petteri Orpo (01:54):\n\nYeah, it's closed.\n\nPresiden Trump (01:54):\n\nAnd that's because you have so many Russians trying to get in?\n\nPrime Minister Petteri Orpo (01:58):\n\nYes. They started to push illegal migrants to our border. That's why we were forced to close it.\n\nPresiden Trump (02:05):\n\nAnd people also that don't want to go into the military, I guess, trying to come through. Right?\n\nPresident Alexander Stubb (02:09):\n\nYeah. Some of them are escaping. Fortunately, on our side, we don't have that problem in Finland.\n\nPresiden Trump (02:15):\n\nNo, you have a great military.\n\nPresident Alexander Stubb (02:16):\n\nYeah, we have compulsory military service. And as I always say, we have 900,000 men and women who've done it, including myself and the Prime Minister, we have 200-\n\nPresiden Trump (02:27):\n\nAnd you've been fighting Russia for a long time. So how many years have you been indirectly fighting Russia?\n\nPresident Alexander Stubb (02:33):\n\nWell, put it this way, we have managed our relationship since the 1300s with about 30 skirmishes, but it's been very peaceful at our border after World War II.\n\nPresiden Trump (02:42):\n\n1300s?\n\nPresident Alexander Stubb (02:42):\n\nYeah. But it's been peaceful at our border since the Winter War and the War of Continuation. But a lot of it is because we actually have a very large military. It's the biggest in Europe, together with Turkey, Ukraine, and Poland. We have over 60 F-18s, we just bought 64 F-35s. We'll roll out the first one in Texas in December. We have the biggest artillery in Europe, together with Poland. And as I always say, we don't have it because we're worried about Stockholm.\n\nPresiden Trump (03:15):\n\nWell, you really have proportionately, I think, the largest military in the world, proportionately.\n\nPresident Alexander Stubb (03:20):\n\nIt's quite big, yes, I have to admit. But we have it for defense purposes and also to build the deterrence, and it's worked. And I think that's one of the reasons that our relationship is so good as well. We have the defense cooperation agreement with you, we're new allies in NATO. Our defense expenditure is going north of 3%. We work very closely with you and the rest of our allies.\n\n(03:44)And when you push the ceiling of defense expenditure in NATO to 5%, you can imagine that a country like Finland was quite pleased with that because that means that all of the allies have to bring up their defense expenditure. And you basically increased our security just with that decision in The Hague. And I have to admit that having been to my first NATO summit in the summer of 2024, if someone would've told me that you will move from 2% to 5% after Trump enters, I would've said, \"Go see a doctor.\"\n\nPresiden Trump (04:14):\n\nWell, you had to do it, and you were great about it. Spain has not been, Spain is the one that didn't do it. And so I think people are going to have to start speaking to Spain. The only one that didn't do it, the only NATO country that didn't do it is Spain. And you'll figure what that's all about, right?\n\nPresident Alexander Stubb (04:32):\n\nYeah. We'll work, and I think with the leadership also, Mark Rutte, the Secretary General of NATO, I think there are a lot of commitments that have to take place. And this, of course, is going to also increase industrial defense exchanges.\n\n(04:46)I think we buy four times more military material here from the US, and I think it's an essential part of our whole military setup in Europe. And it's good to be working on this together. But there's one thing that I wanted to mention also. I want to congratulate you for what we have seen in the past 24 hours in Gaza.\n\nPresiden Trump (05:06):\n\nThank you.\n\nPresident Alexander Stubb (05:08):\n\nI think it's a historic deal. I went through the 20 points. It's almost like the best of record. You really see all the key elements. And if someone would've said a few weeks back that you and your team are able to push us to a position where there will be a ceasefire, an exchange of prisoners, hostages, and then a pullback, I would not have believed it. But this is what diplomacy is at its best. And I think it's a potentially huge deal. So congratulations to you and your team.\n\nPresiden Trump (05:38):\n\nPeace in the Middle East.\n\nPresident Alexander Stubb (05:39):\n\nPeace in the Middle East.\n\nPresiden Trump (05:40):\n\nAnd every country came together. Every single country came together, and people are shocked by it, but it's an amazing situation. Nobody thought it was going to happen. Thank you very much. And you've been of help too. You help always. But we are really working more closely together, having to deal with Russia, Ukraine.\n\n(05:57)And I would've thought that would've been easier 'cause that would be number eight for me, number eight. And I would've thought the Russia deal maybe would've been one of the easier ones. And unfortunately, last week they had over 7,000 soldiers die unnecessarily. So it's a terrible thing, but I think we'll be getting there, hopefully soon.\n\nPresident Alexander Stubb (06:16):\n\nYeah, probably we'll go or you will be going piece by piece. There are only so many agreements that you can get done, and I think this one will be the next big one. Of course, this one needs to stick, and I'm sure it will because the incentives are all there, and then we'll continue to work.\n\n(06:33)The last time I was here in the Oval Office was with the other European leaders in August, and I think we did a lot of good advancement there on security arrangements. I think you pushed us Europeans hard not to buy oil and gas from Russia, which I think is a very correct decision. Europe just put down its 19th sanctioned package.\n\n(06:54)I think Russia is actually, right now, both economically and militarily not in a very strong place. And I think it's because of the commitments that we've made to Ukraine. So day by day on this one.\n\nPresiden Trump (07:07):\n\nWe're going to get it worked out.\n\nPresident Alexander Stubb (08:37):\n\n… doesn't win over the small guy and vice versa. But I have to say that the track record of the President of the United States in the past seven months, eight months is rather impressive.\n\nSpeaker 4 (08:54):\n\nMr. President, thank you so much, Mr. President. First of all, thank you, all of you on behalf of the state of Israel for everything that you're doing for my country. I want to know, how do you see the Middle East in a year from now under your leadership? And if you see maybe option for normalization between Israel and Saudi Arabia?\n\nPresiden Trump (09:13):\n\nI think it's going to be great. I think the hostages will be coming back Monday or Tuesday. I'll probably be there. I hope to be there. And we're planning on leaving sometime Sunday, and I look forward to it.\n\n(09:30)And everybody, I see you celebrating in Israel, but they're celebrating in many other countries, too. A lot of the Muslim and Arab countries, they're celebrating. Everybody's celebrating. Everybody loves the deal. So it's a great honor to have been working on it. And as you know, it's all finalized and done.\n\n(09:49)We've had a lot of terrifically talented people. We've had tremendous support from UAE, Saudi Arabia, Qatar has been unbelievable, unbelievable, Egypt, as you know. And Jordan, Indonesia.\n\n(10:05)I don't want to leave anybody out. Just so many --, so many different countries. It's been incredible. Nobody's seen anything like it, so I think in a year from now, it's going to be great. I think it's going to be-\n\nSpeaker 5 (10:16):\n\nMr. President, how do you rate your chances of winning the Nobel Peace Prize tomorrow?\n\nPresiden Trump (10:21):\n\nWell, look, I made seven deals and now it's, eight, solved the wars, one going 31 years, one going 34 years, one going 35 years, one going 10 years. I made seven deals. This would be number eight. The one I thought that I was going to make, and I think we will, probably, 'cause is because a ridiculous war, it's a horrible war, the worse since World War II, you look at the people dying, is Russia, Ukraine. I think we'll do that too.\n\n(10:55)A lot of reasons for them to do it, and I think they'll be coming to the table pretty soon, but this is the biggest of them all. This is a big one. Although, I think India and Pakistan is very big, two nuclear nations. I made that. I did that based on trade. And because of the tariffs, if we didn't have tariffs, you wouldn't have been able to do it. But I said, \"If you guys are going to fight, I'm putting 100% tariffs on each of you. And they immediately stopped fighting. And that was going to go nuclear, that was back and forth.\n\n(11:24)So I know one thing, I don't know what they're going to do, really, but I know this, that nobody in history has solved eight wars in a period of nine months, and I've stopped eight wars. So that's never happened before. But they'll have to do what they do. Whatever they do is fine. I know this, I didn't do it for that. I did it because I saved a lot of lives.\n\n(11:47)And that's the thing that bothers me so much about the Russian-Ukraine, 7,000 people are dying a week, young soldiers, they're almost all soldiers of Ukraine and Russia. So in theory, it doesn't affect us, no, but it's a terrible thing, and we'll get that solved, too. But nobody has ever done eight wars. Nobody's done eight wars in 30 years, let alone 9 months.\n\nSpeaker 5 (12:10):\n\nAre you going to step up?\n\nSpeaker 6 (12:10):\n\nMr. President Obama got it for way less-\n\nSpeaker 5 (12:11):\n\nAre you going to step up the pressure for a Ukraine deal?\n\nPresiden Trump (12:14):\n\nWe're stepping up the pressure, we're stepping it up together. We're all stepping it up. NATO has been great. The leader of NATO, as you know, Mark, has been fantastic, I think. And he's a fantastic guy, and they are stepping it up. And we're selling a lot of weapons to NATO, and that's going, I guess, to Ukraine for the most part. That's up to them.\n\n(12:36)But they're buying weapons from the US. We make the greatest weapons in the world. You buy our planes and a lot of our equipment. And you have a big force. Actually, you have a tremendous force of equipment. So I think we'll get that one done, too. Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 6 (12:56):\n\nMr. President, Obama got it for way less.\n\nPresiden Trump (12:57):\n\n[inaudible 00:13:01].\n\nSpeaker 7 (13:00):\n\nMr. President, I'm from Finland. Mr. President, I'm from Finland.\n\nPresiden Trump (13:09):\n\nIs he okay?\n\nSpeaker 7 (13:09):\n\nAm I okay?\n\nPresident Alexander Stubb (13:09):\n\nHe's all right.\n\nSpeaker 7 (13:10):\n\nI'm all right.\n\nPresiden Trump (13:10):\n\nHe looks great.\n\nSpeaker 7 (13:10):\n\nYeah, President, you are buying icebreakers from Finland.\n\nPresiden Trump (13:13):\n\nYeah.\n\nSpeaker 7 (13:13):\n\nBut what if Russia and Vladimir Putin attacks Finland? Would you defend Finland?\n\nPresiden Trump (13:20):\n\nI would. Yes, I would. They're a member of NATO. I would. And a great people, but I don't think that's going to happen. I don't think he's going to do that. I think the chances of that are very, very small.\n\n(13:31)But it's very interesting, because you have a very big military relative to your size. You have a very powerful military. One of the best, but certainly we will be there to help.\n\nSpeaker 7 (13:43):\n\nThank you.\n\nSpeaker 8 (13:43):\n\n[inaudible 00:13:45], Mr. President.\n\nPresiden Trump (13:47):\n\nOkay. Please.\n\nSpeaker 9 (13:49):\n\nThank you. We have a big border, as our president said. How would you exactly defend Finland? And yeah, thank you.\n\nPresiden Trump (13:59):\n\nSay what?\n\nPresident Alexander Stubb (14:00):\n\nHow would you defend Finland?\n\nPresiden Trump (14:03):\n\nVigorously.\n\nPresident Alexander Stubb (14:07):\n\nCan I just add on that? We're very pleased with the fact that we have so much training going on with American soldiers right now, so they're getting experience from Arctic conditions, and we're integrating our militaries together, working not only through the DCA agreement, but other ways as well. We see that day to day in the work that we do, and it's working well.\n\nPresiden Trump (14:30):\n\nOkay. Yes, please.\n\nSpeaker 10 (14:34):\n\nYeah. Thank you. How do you see this-\n\nPresiden Trump (14:36):\n\nWhere are you from?\n\nSpeaker 10 (14:37):\n\nI'm from Finland too, Finnish News Agency.\n\nPresiden Trump (14:39):\n\n[inaudible 00:14:42].\n\nSpeaker 10 (14:41):\n\nSo Mr. President-\n\nPresiden Trump (14:42):\n\n[inaudible 00:14:43] better than our reporters.\n\nSpeaker 10 (14:45):\n\nThank you. So how do you see the situation in the Arctic developing? Are there going to be any mutual plans for Finland and US to collaborate there?\n\nPresiden Trump (14:55):\n\nWe have a lot of relationships together, mostly buying our military equipment. They buy a lot of it. They have an order, I guess 60 plans, 60-\n\nPresident Alexander Stubb (15:03):\n\n64.\n\nPresiden Trump (15:04):\n\n64 F-35s, and many other things, too. It's a big order. Big countries don't order that many planes.\n\nPresident Alexander Stubb (15:14):\n\n10 billion.\n\nPresiden Trump (15:15):\n\nYou have a lot of aircraft, a lot of great military. We make the best military equipment. They buy a lot from us, so it's very good. We're going to work together very closely with Finland and with NATO, we have a very good relationship. As you know, I requested that they pay 5%, not 2%, and most people thought that was not going to happen, and it happened virtually unanimously.\n\n(15:38)We had one laggard. It was Spain. Spain. You have to call them and find why are they a laggard. And they're doing well too. Because of a lot of the things we've done, they're doing fine. They have no excuse not to do this, but that's all right. Maybe you should throw them out of NATO, frankly.\n\nSpeaker 10 (16:03):\n\nMr. President-\n\nPresiden Trump (16:04):\n\nPlease, go ahead.\n\nSpeaker 10 (16:04):\n\nWhat are you planning to do with-\n\nPresiden Trump (16:04):\n\nA tall gentleman, nice tall gentleman with a yellow shirt.\n\nSpeaker 11 (16:04):\n\nThank you, Mr. President. I wanted to change gears just really quickly and ask you, you're going to Walter Reed tomorrow. What are you having done and how are you feeling?\n\nPresiden Trump (16:10):\n\nI'm meeting with the troops, and I'm also going to do a sort of semi-annual physical, which I do. And I think I'm in great shape, but I'll let you know. But no, I have no difficulty thus far. Is there wood around here? Knock on. No difficulty. Physically, I feel very good. Mentally, I feel very good.\n\n(16:32)About six, seven months ago I do physicals. When I'm around, I like to check. Always early, always be early. It's a lesson for a lot of people, but I also did a cognitive exam, which is always very risky, because if I didn't do well, you'd be the first to be blurting it. And I had a perfect score, and one of the doctors said he's almost never seen a perfect score. I had a perfect score, I got the highest score, and that made me feel good.\n\n(17:03)When they asked would I like to do one, I said, \"Yeah.\" I said, \"Did Obama do it?\" \"No.\" \"Did Bush do it?\" \"No.\" \"Did Biden do it?\" Definitely Biden wouldn't have gotten the first three questions right. No. Biden didn't do it. Biden should have done it. I'm actually a person that believes that if you're president, you should do a cognitive exam.\n\n(17:22)But the last time I took a cognitive exam and it was a perfect score, the doctors announced it. And by the way, not the easiest test. The first few questions are pretty easy. Once you get into the middle, it gets a little trickier, and there aren't a lot of people in this room that would get every single question right. I can guarantee you.\n\nPresident Alexander Stubb (17:43):\n\nYou're putting me in a difficult spot now. Next question.\n\nSpeaker 6 (17:47):\n\nMr. President, Obama got the Nobel Peace Prize for way less than you did, and you… Obama, President Obama got the Nobel Peace Prize for way less.\n\nPresiden Trump (17:56):\n\nHe got a prize for doing nothing.\n\nSpeaker 6 (17:56):\n\nExactly.\n\nPresiden Trump (17:57):\n\nObama got a prize. He didn't even know what he got. He got elected and they gave it to Obama for doing absolutely nothing but destroying our country. No, he was not a good president. The worst president was Sleepy Joe Biden, but Obama was not a good president.\n\nSpeaker 6 (18:15):\n\nAre you going to do something with Hezbollah?\n\nPresiden Trump (18:15):\n\nThey gave him a prize. How many months after he won the election, then they gave him the Peace Prize. Right?\n\nVice President JD Vance (18:19):\n\nIt was right after.\n\nSecretary of State Marco Rubio (18:20):\n\nIt was before he was elected.\n\nPresiden Trump (18:22):\n\nMy election was a much more important election.\n\nSpeaker 6 (18:27):\n\nNow that you're fixing the situation between Hamas and Israel, are you going to be taking care of the Hezbollah or the Lebanese armed forces, to take care of the Hezbollah?\n\nPresiden Trump (18:38):\n\nYeah, we'll be able to do that. It's a smaller part of the puzzle, but a very important part. They have a great new ambassador that I appointed, Michel, great new ambassador. So yeah, please.\n\nSpeaker 14 (18:48):\n\nMr. President, you were saying that the hostages will be released on Monday or Tuesday. What's your strict deadline? When do they have to get released, and how do you make sure each party abides by the deal?\n\nPresiden Trump (18:57):\n\nSo it should be around that time. Yeah. They're working on it very hard.\n\nSpeaker 14 (18:58):\n\nTuesday, I believe.\n\nPresiden Trump (19:00):\n\nThey're at very diverse parts of the earth. Okay? They're very, very diverse. Actually, I think they're going to come through. I'd be surprised if they didn't. I think it'll happen.\n\nSpeaker 15 (19:15):\n\nThank you, sir. The 19th point of the 20-point plan that in the future there could be conditions in which the Palestinians might eventually get a state. Under what conditions do you think the Palestinians could ever get astate in the future?\n\nPresiden Trump (19:26):\n\nWell, we'll look at it at the time. We're going to see how it all goes. And there's a point at which we may do something that would be a little bit different and may be very positive for everybody, but we'll be looking at that at the time. And I think we'll get to that period, too.\n\nSpeaker 15 (19:42):\n\nYeah, please.\n\nSpeaker 16 (19:42):\n\nMr. President-\n\nPresiden Trump (19:43):\n\nYeah, please. Glasses.\n\nSpeaker 17 (19:45):\n\nThank you. Mr. President, the United States has previously said that Europe would have to take more responsibility for its own security. Are you or the US planning to withdraw some of the US forces from the European soil?\n\nPresiden Trump (20:02):\n\nNo, but we may move some around a little bit. I'd ask you that question, Pete. Go ahead.\n\nSecretary of War Pete Hegseth (20:07):\n\nI think that's right, Mr. President. We're very much heartened by your leadership to get NATO to rise up to 5%, which means they can take primary responsibility for defense of the continent. But that doesn't mean America is abandoning NATO in Europe, but we could look at where our troops are postured, what makes the most sense for America and our NATO allies.\n\nPresiden Trump (20:27):\n\nWe have a lot of troops in Europe, as you know, a lot, and we can move them around a little bit, but no, basically we'll be pretty much set. Go ahead, what's your second?\n\nSpeaker 17 (20:37):\n\nMy second question would be, are you planning to impose more sanctions on Russia at this point?\n\nPresiden Trump (20:42):\n\nI might. Yeah, I might.\n\nSpeaker 19 (20:43):\n\nMr. president, your 20-point plan says we will encourage people to stay. Can you confirm that as Gaza is rebuilt, that no one will be forced to leave?\n\nPresiden Trump (20:54):\n\nNobody's going to be forced to leave. No. It's just the opposite. This is a great plan. This is a great peace plan. This is a plan that was supported by everybody. As I said, they're dancing in the streets of many, many countries right now. It's amazing. I've never seen anything like it. No, we're not looking to do that at all. Please.\n\nSpeaker 20 (21:16):\n\nMr. president, can you cut through politics on the shutdown? We had another failed vote today. Can you speak to our viewers from Orlando to Sacramento? What's your message to some of these families tonight facing missed paychecks, potential layoffs, and missed benefits due to the shutdown?\n\nPresiden Trump (21:28):\n\nYeah, I blame the Democrats. They ought to call their local Democrat representative, whether it's a senator or a congressman, and it's their fault. They admit it, it's their fault. They campaigned on the fact that they'd never shut down the country, but they wanted to shut it down.\n\n(21:45)And we have the greatest economy. We're the hottest country in the world right now. I think you'd admit that. The hottest country. We went from a dead country a year ago to the hottest country in the world. So, I think they probably don't like that, but we're doing great. My message is call your local representative, congressman or senator, and tell them to get on the ball. The Democrats have caused this problem. Yeah, please.\n\nSpeaker 21 (22:14):\n\nThank you, Mr. President,\n\nPresiden Trump (22:16):\n\nWhere are you from?\n\nSpeaker 21 (22:16):\n\nI'm from Finland.\n\nPresiden Trump (22:17):\n\nI love [inaudible 00:22:18] so nice. Uh-oh. Here we go. Here we go with the killer question.\n\nSpeaker 21 (22:24):\n\nI would like to circle back to the icebreaker deal. So Finland and the US are strengthening their economic partnership through the deal. What other areas of cooperation with Finland do you see as possible for at this moment?\n\nPresiden Trump (22:39):\n\nGood question. We're going to be talking about that in a little while. We're going into the next-door room, commonly known as the Cabinet Room, beautiful room, and we're going to be discussing that, but we'll be doing other things. It's a wonderful country with wonderful people. We've had a long-term relationship, but it's never been as close as it is now. We'll be doing other things. Go ahead.\n\nPresident Alexander Stubb (22:58):\n\nWe've been talking about a lot with the president. Two specific fields where I think Finland has strength. One is quantum and quantum computing, and we know that that is basically what gives food for thought for artificial intelligence. That's very important.\n\n(23:12)The second one is actually networks, and you know that they're two sort of safe and trustworthy Western networks right now. One of them is Nokia and the other one is Ericsson. And actually, 70% of all broadband in the United States is Nokia. So one of the things that we could work on together is creating the 6G space through networks. And actually, Nokia has 7,000 people working here in the United States, and an American CEO.\n\nPresiden Trump (23:40):\n\nOkay. Anybody else?\n\nSpeaker 22 (23:41):\n\nWhat is the international stabilization force that's going to deploy to Gaza? What is that going to look like?\n\nPresiden Trump (23:50):\n\nTo be determined. I think there's going to be a large group of people determining what it'll be, and a group of people funding it that are very rich countries that are going to be funding it. People want to see this work. It's going to work. It's absolutely going to work. It's already started. We've signed, as you know, everybody's agreed.\n\n(24:12)I think Monday is going to be a very big day, Monday, Tuesday, but it's going to be, depending on where you are, it's going to be a very big day. I think it's going to be a day of great celebration. I've never seen anything like it. The streets of so many countries right now, they're just roaring with love and with praise for the people that did this, and these are countries that did this.\n\n(24:36)The whole world came together for this, even Iran, and I really thank them for it. Iran came out and said, \"This is a good thing. This is a very good thing.\" So it was terrific. It's been a terrific experience for me. Thank you very much, everybody. [inaudible 00:24:52].\n\nSpeaker 23 (24:54):\n\nThank you.\n\nSpeaker 24 (24:54):\n\nThank guys. Thank you [inaudible 00:24:58].\n\nSpeaker 23 (24:54):\n\nThank you, press.\n\nSpeaker 24 (25:03):\n\nThank you guys. Thank you, press. Let's go. Let's go. Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 23 (25:11):\n\nThank you guys. Keep moving. Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 24 (25:11):\n\nKeep going. Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 23 (25:11):\n\nKeep going.\n\nSpeaker 24 (25:11):\n\nThank you. Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 23 (25:13):\n\nThanks, guys. Let's go. Let's go.\n\nSpeaker 24 (25:13):\n\nThank you.\n\nSpeaker 23 (25:13):\n\nThank you. Keep going.",

    "transcript": "Speaker 1 (00:02):\n\nMr. President, we just have two quick proclamations for you to sign today. The first, today is Leif Erikson Day. Leif Erikson was a famous Viking explorer who discovered the coast of Newfoundland over a millennium ago. This is a hugely important holiday, particularly to Scandinavian-Americans who celebrate his legacy as a great explorer, as a devout Christian, and really just a fascinating individual in the history of our continent.\n\nPresident Trump (00:27):\n\nSweden and various other countries. We have a lot of people from Sweden, a lot of Scandinavians. This is very important for Scandinavians, and that's a great honor. Okay. Now you have another one that's…\n\nSpeaker 1 (00:41):\n\nThis is like-\n\nPresident Trump (00:41):\n\n… I think very non-controversial, frankly, but some people would say it's controversial. Go ahead.\n\nSpeaker 1 (00:46):\n\nThis is like Explorer Day for you, sir. Today we have your Columbus Day proclamation for Monday, which we're signing a bit early. Christopher Columbus obviously discovered the New World in 1492. He was a great Italian explorer. He sailed his three ships, the Nina, the Pinta, and the Santa Maria across the Atlantic Ocean and landed in what's today the Caribbean. But this is a particularly important holiday for Italian-Americans who celebrate the legacy of Christopher Columbus and the innovation and explorer zeal that he represented.\n\nPresident Trump (01:20):\n\nIn other words, we're calling it Columbus Day.\n\nSpeaker 2 (01:28):\n\nYes!\n\nPresident Trump (01:28):\n\nThat was the press that broke out in applause. Can you believe that? I've never seen that happen before. The press actually broke out in applause. Good. Columbus Day. We're back. Columbus Day, we're back, Italians. We love the Italians. Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1 (01:50):\n\nThank you, Mr. President.\n\nPresident Trump (01:51):\n\nThank you. Great. Thank you very much.\n\nSpeaker 1 (01:53):\n\nHave a good one, sir.\n\nPresident Trump (01:54):\n\nSo we covered Scandinavia and Italy. Not bad. Now for the rest of the world. So I want to thank everybody for being here. As you know, last night we reached a momentous breakthrough in the Middle East, something that people said was never going to be done. We ended the war in Gaza and really, on a much bigger basis, created peace, and I think it's going to be a lasting peace, hopefully an everlasting peace. Peace in the Middle East. We secured the release of all of the remaining hostages, and they should be released on Monday or Tuesday. Getting them is a complicated process. I'd rather not tell you what they have to do to get them. They're places you don't want to be. But we are getting the hostages back on Tuesday, Monday or Tuesday, and that'll be a day of joy. I'm going to try and make a trip over. We're going to try and get over there. We're working on the timing, the exact timing. We're going to go to Egypt, where we'll have a signing, an additional signing. We've already had a signing representing me, but we're going to have an official signing.\n\n(03:05)And the amazing thing is all of the countries over there, from Qatar to Saudi Arabia to UAE, to all of them, the rich ones, the less-than-rich ones, they've all come together, something which is amazing, actually. They've all come together for this, and they're really probably the best relationships they've ever had. So it's been really something incredible that… Nobody thought it was possible to get it done. And very importantly, the hostages are coming back. As you know, they consider them hostages. They talk about them as hostages. But there are approximately 28 dead people, mostly young, mostly men and boys, boys. The one woman talked about her baby. Her baby's 25 years old, but to her, it's her baby. And we're bringing them home. We're getting everything. And to those parents, the dead young man is just as important as though this person we're alive. It's amazing. I've never seen anything quite like it. I've been very much involved. I've never seen anything quite like it. But it's really peace in the Middle East.\n\n(04:22)And you remember, October 7th was terrible, but also from the Hamas standpoint, they probably lost 70, 000 people. That's big retribution. That's big retribution. But at some point, that whole thing has to stop, and we're going to see to it. Gaza is going to be slowly redone. You have tremendous wealth in that part of the world by certain countries, and just a small part of that, what they make will do wonders for Gaza. And I think you're going to see some tremendous countries stepping up and putting up a lot of money and taking care of things. But there's tremendous spirit like I haven't seen, and even the news, I won't call it fake news for this purpose because they really were very fair today, I must tell you, in all cases, but they covered it very well. They covered it very fairly. Everybody loves it, everybody. People that were never giving us a fair shake, frankly, they can't even believe it. They're amazed by it. A lot of people are. But just everything came together.\n\n(05:39)I think the attack was very important on Iran because… Let's say that didn't happen. They'd probably by now have a nuclear weapon, numerous nuclear weapons, and therefore, even if we signed a deal, there'd be a big, dark cloud over it, and it wouldn't be the same thing. So Iran is different. But Iran wants to work on peace now, they've informed us, and they've acknowledged that they're totally in favor of this deal. They think it's a great thing, so we appreciate that. And we'll work with Iran. As you know, we have major sanctions on Iran and lots of other things. We'd like to see them be able to rebuild their country too. But they can't have a nuclear weapon.\n\n(06:20)So I want to express my tremendous gratitude to the leaders of Qatar, Egypt, and Turkey for helping us reach this incredible day and for being there. They were there with us all the way. And of course, as you know, Saudi Arabia and Jordan, and so many. I will tell you, President Erdogan was personally involved in dealing with Hamas and some of the others. He's been great. They've all been really amazing. Indonesia has been amazing. Indonesia has been fantastic. The whole world has come together for this, people that didn't get along, people that didn't like each other, neighboring countries that frankly didn't like each other, but now this is the moment in time. So we look forward to welcoming the hostages like you can't believe home to their families, and that'll take place early next week. We hope Monday or Tuesday. And all Americans should be proud of the role that our country has played in bringing this terrible conflict to an end.\n\n(07:25)And I want to thank some of the people, JD, you were fantastic, and Pete, you were great. Marco was fantastic. Some of you were very much involved. I'm looking around. Indirectly, I think almost everybody in this room was involved. Susie, I want to thank you very much. You were incredible. You've done an incredible job. And yes, John, what you've done was invaluable. CIA, John Radcliffe, and he's done an incredible job. So I want to thank you all, and if I'm missing anybody, I apologize. But you've been amazing.\n\n(07:59)And then you have Steve Witkoff, who worked so hard. You remember, we settled seven, this is number eight, we settled seven wars or major conflicts, but wars, and this is number eight. And the one that I thought would be maybe the quickest of all would be Russia-Ukraine, and I think that's going to happen too. But in the meantime, they're losing about 7,000 people a week, and that seems pretty bad. They're losing mostly soldiers, young soldiers. They go out to war and they're getting killed. And while it doesn't affect us in a lot of ways, where we got a big ocean in between, you don't want to see that happen. It was a big mistake. That war should have never happened. It would've never happened if I were president.\n\n(08:47)So we're here this morning for a Cabinet meeting as my administration continues to deliver for the American people, despite the radical-left lunatics that shut down our government. You have Democrats that they've lost their way. They have no leadership. We don't even know who to deal with over there. At least they know who to deal with. We have no idea who we're dealing with over there. It's like they have no idea what they're doing. Republicans have voted repeatedly to pass a clean, nonpartisan bill to reopen government at the same funding levels. We're not going to do anything only good for healthcare. We're really, I think, become the party of good healthcare. And they keep using healthcare as a cudgel, want to try and get everyone thinking about healthcare. We're the ones that are saving healthcare.\n\n(09:34)In fact, one of the things we're doing is we're going to be reducing the cost of medicines by 100%, 200, 300, 500%, and even more than that because, as you know, we're in the process of favored nations right now. We've exercised a clause because we were subsidizing the entire world. The entire world pays a fraction of what the United States has been paying. Numerous Pfizer and other companies have already signed. And other countries are a bigger problem because they've been getting a subsidized rate. We've been paying for years. This has gone on for 30 years. We've been reducing the rate of drugs for other countries because we've been paying much more than we're supposed to. And they used all sorts of ideas like research and development. Well, I said, \"What about Germany? What about these other countries? Aren't they paying?\" \"No, no, we have to pay research and development.\" It was all nonsense, and I couldn't listen to it anymore. So it's a very radical, big, tough shift. Very tough. We got a lot of things going on today.\n\n(10:45)And you probably heard me say this, my first term, I think it was my third year, we reduced drugs from the beginning of the year to the end of the year. And I was so proud of it, I actually had a news conference to announce it, and it was one-eighth of 1%. Think of that, which barely a reduction. But it's the first time in 28 years that there was a reduction in drug prices for the year. So from the beginning to the end, it was one-eighth of 1%, and I was so proud of myself. I did something that nobody else could do. But when I started to think about it, I said, \"Doesn't make sense.\"\n\n(11:24)And then I'm starting to look at numbers where a pill or a treatment or some pharmaceutical product is selling in Europe for 10% of what we pay for in New York City or in any one of our places and cities, states. And then I see people leaving for other countries to go buy their pharmaceuticals, where they'd make journeys to various other countries, including Europe, where they got the best bargains of all. And I put an end to it. It's over.\n\n(11:57)And now we're in major, I guess, disputes, but we're winning the disputes by a lot. With the countries, a couple of countries said, \"We won't do this.\" I said, \"Well, it's unfair that we're paying 10%, and you're paying just a fraction of what we're paying for the same product made in the same plant.\" And they said, \"Well, we're not going to do it.\" I said, \"That's okay. You don't have to do it. But I'm going to put a tariff of 9% or 7%,\" or whatever the amount of money is, \"and I'm going to put a tariff on your country for the amount of money that you're taking advantage of us for.\" \"No, no, no, you can't.\" I said, \"Yeah, I can do that. I'm going to do that,\" and they would immediately agree. And I'd make the tariff substantially more than the number we're talking about, and they would immediately agree.\n\n(12:46)So we have the consent, I think, Bobby, of every country, essentially. They know that if they don't do it, we're going to put a tariff on for double the price, and then they're going to do it. So we never had that before. You never had anybody in here that knew what the hell they were doing, I'll be honest. Really, it makes me angry, because for years and years, and this started many years ago, and basically we subsidized the world. So this is going to have a huge positive impact on Medicare, Medicaid, even social security. But anything where there's pharmaceuticals, drugs involved, it's going to have a tremendous impact.\n\n(13:23)So we're going to get drug reductions of 100%. I told you one-eighth of 1% that I was proud of myself. Now you're going to get 100%, 150%, 200, 300, 400, 500%. You're going to get the biggest drug reductions that you've ever seen. And they're already, I guess they're starting to kick in. But we've made deals with numerous companies where… And we're going for the full board. We want whatever the price is. So that would mean that the world price, because the world is bigger than the United States, a lot more people, but the world price will go up a little bit and our price will come down a lot. So if a pill sells for $10 in London and $100 here, the pill will go to $20 in London and $20 for us. It's pretty simple. And that is a number that nobody can even fathom.\n\n(14:19)It's a little like tariffs. Nobody knew how big they were. Nobody knew until they started seeing the trillions of dollars that have come in. I don't know why they didn't understand it. It's something they should have understood. We were taken advantage of for years with tariffs, and now, I don't want to say we're taking advantage, but we've become a very strong country because of the money that's coming in.\n\n(14:44)Republicans have voted repeatedly to pass a clean, nonpartisan bill to reopen our government. And remember, at the same funding levels, both parties have supported in the past. So the radical Democrats have chosen to put the economy to our country. We have the best economy we've ever had. We had the best economy in my first term, but we have an economy that's blowing it away, and we have the Democrats are trying to obstruct. They don't want to have a good economy. I don't think they want to have a good country.\n\n(15:16)That's why they try and stop our law enforcement from doing what we did in Washington, DC. Washington, DC, we have a great, safe, beautiful capital right now. Beautiful. It's so safe. You can walk down the street. Numerous people standing before me were mugged, and you're not going to get mugged anymore. We have a safe capital, one of the safest. We took it from one of the most unsafe places to one of the most safe places in the country. And we also beautified it, and one of the process of doing even more so. So we're very proud of our capital. Again, we were embarrassed by our capital. A lot of people being killed. They'd come from Iowa, Indiana, Florida, they'd come up and they end up getting shot. They're not getting shot. We moved out 1700 people approximately, right? Approximately 1700 hardened criminals, career criminals, they moved them out.\n\n(16:09)So Chuck Schumer and Hakeem Jeffries and the Congressional Democrats are holding the entire federal government hostage. I will tell you, a lot of Democrats want to get this thing open too. They do. They're calling us and they just want to get it open. And all we're doing is saying, \"Just play the same thing until we get it straight,\" and they don't know how to go about it. And the problem is we really don't know who the hell is leading the Democrats. You have this AOC. I don't know her at all, but I watched her the other day. She said, \"Well, if they want, they could come to my office.\" That's not leadership.\n\n(16:49)The only one that challenged her actually was Nancy Pelosi, and Nancy is not looking too good. I don't know what happened to Nancy, but she's not looking great. But she was the only one. I give her credit. She was the only one that challenged her. But AOC said that they can come to her office and negotiate the Republicans and was saying, \"Oh, I didn't know she was in leadership,\" but she's taking Hakeem Jeffries' place, and Schumer's afraid that she's going to run against him. And right now… I don't know, it can change. Life is crazy, right? But right now, I don't think he can beat anybody. He'll lose in a primary. I would say he'll retire before he loses in a primary. So I think Schumer's going to retire because he can't beat anybody. His polls are so bad.\n\n(17:36)Meanwhile, the Democrat shutdown is causing pain and suffering for hardworking Americans, including our military, our air traffic controllers, and impoverished mothers, people with young children, people that have to live not the greatest of lives. But we're doing so many tax cuts. We've cut their taxes. The Great Big Beautiful Bill, we've cut their taxes at levels that\n\nPresident Trump (18:00):\n\nNobody's ever seen. I mean, no tax on tips, no tax on social security, no tax on overtime. It's been a great thing for a lot of people. They're doing great. Despite all of the damage that is caused, the shutdown has been pretty damaging. I mean, it's not yet because it's early, but it gets a little bit worse as it goes along. And we'll be making cuts that will be permanent and we're only going to cut Democrat programs, I hate to tell you. I guess that makes sense. But we're only cutting Democrat programs. But we're going to start that. And we have Russell, we can talk to you about it if he wants to, but we'll be cutting some very popular Democrat programs that aren't popular with Republicans, frankly, because that's the way it works. They wanted to do this, so we'll give them a little taste of their own medicine.\n\n(18:50)But Chuck Schumer proclaimed this morning that every day gets better for them. Now, every day it's actually getting worse for them and they're having a rebellion in the Democrat party because they want to stop. And if you saw all of Schumer's, I watched last night like 10 different times over the years, he said, \"You can't shut down government. You can't shut down.\" And now he's the one that shut it down. So this is a confession that he's acting not to serve the people, but to serve the partisan interests of his party. And I don't think he's serving them well because they're way down. Look, they just lost an election in a landslide. It was interesting. I watched Kamala, it was a sad figure. I watched her the other day saying the election was very close. I said, \"No, the election was a landslide.\" We won the popular vote by millions.\n\n(19:38)We won the electoral college by I think three 12 or three 15 to 220 something. But there's another one that we won that's probably, that's why when you see the maps, the maps are completely red. It's counties, the counties we won at 2,505 to 525. So 2, 500 to 525, that's called one of the greatest biggest landslides in history. And that's one that people are using now as a primary, but literally when you see it colored in the entire country is red representing Republicans. So they go around, they just lie. They just lie, and everything's a big lie with them. Well, the other side, and the other thing I don't understand is Kristi, I looked at crime numbers in Chicago, they're through the roof and I have a governor stands up every day and tells us how wonderful Chicago is. Just a lie. It's like a con job.\n\n(20:43)It's like Gavin Newsom. He says how well he is doing in California and they're doing terribly. Population's getting smaller. People are leaving and other people are coming in, and I wouldn't say it's an even trade while the other side is focused on playing games, the Trump administration's focused on creating jobs, bringing down prices, and we've really brought them down a lot. That's the other thing. We're bringing down prices a lot. We're bringing down grocery prices, but the big thing is energy. When you bring down energy, everything comes down and the energy prices are way down. I see we're down to about $61 now a barrel and what we're gasoline is going to be. I think gasoline is going to be below $2 at some point in the pretty near future. It's very low, much lower than it was under Sleepy Joe. We're restoring law and order in our country.\n\n(21:37)We're restoring it here, but we're restoring it right now. We're in Memphis, we're going to Chicago, we're going to other cities. Many governors are asking us to, including Democrats are trying to ask… I don't know what the big problem is. If I were a Democrat governor, I'd be saying, \"Whatever you can do to get crime down, I'll take anybody. You can bring them in any… I don't care who it is.\" A lot of people said that they interviewed women, these beautiful women in Chicago, Black women with a MAGA hat, a red hat. They said, \"We don't care who he brings in here, but this place is really dangerous. We just want crime to stop.\" It's true. They don't care. They don't differentiate between the National Guard and the Marines. They don't care. They'll take anybody. And that's the way it is. I mean, they want to see…\n\n(22:26)They want what we did in D.C. They want to happen to them. And it's happening in Memphis already. I see in less than a week the numbers are really good and it'll be great and it will fix that. We'll go to various other places and we're going to be stopping crime in our cities, and that's a great thing and we won't get credit for it, but it's a great thing. We've launched a historic campaign to take back our nation from the gangs and the street criminals, violent repeat offenders, illegal alien lawbreakers, domestic extremists, and savage, bloodthirsty cartels. And very little by the way, is coming in by water in case you haven't known. The drugs aren't coming in by water. In fact, you can't even find any boats in the water anymore. We had boats. We were like a subway train with, loaded up with drugs.\n\n(23:13)Every boat, every single boat that you see getting taken out kills 25,000 Americans think of that because it's pretty tough stuff, but it kills 25,000 Americans. So when you hear that, it's no longer tough. But here in Washington, we've deployed federal law enforcement and National Guard to restore public safety. And we're working to replicate that in numerous places all over the country. And we have a very powerful military. We have a very powerful National Guard. I want to thank the governor of Texas who has been as usual, great Governor Abbott. He gave us 400 troops without even a question. And we have other governors likewise doing what has to be done because they know we have to confront crime. We're directly confronting the sinister threat of left-wing domestic terrorism or violence, including the terrorist group Antifa, you saw that yesterday. We had a news conference.\n\n(24:10)Antifa is out of control in Portland and other places, but mostly Portland and the case of Antifa. And we had people that were really badly affected by them. It was terrible. So one of those things, but we're knocking the hell out of them and we're looking for the people that are funding them, and those people are going to be just as guilty as the people that smack people over the head with a baseball bat. And I'd like now to ask Attorney General Bondi and Secretary Noem to discuss this a little bit and tell where we are, and then we'll go around the room. We'll go quickly. We're going to go quickly if we can because we have a lot of things to do, including I won't be spending that much time here because I'll be leaving fairly soon for the Middle East and I'm very honored to be involved with that. I'll tell you, it's a great thing, great thing for our country people are so happy about. I've never experienced anything quite like it. I've never seen such universal praise for being able to do something.\n\n(25:09)It's something that nobody thought was possible and we're going to end up having peace in the Middle East. Who would've thought? So, Pam, could you start and then Kristi, please? Sure.\n\nPam Bondi (25:18):\n\nSure President Trump, and despite the Democrats shutdown of our government, our law enforcement officers are out there working without paychecks round the clock to keep and make America safe. Secretary Hegseth and I were recently in Memphis. We had 1100 law enforcement officers in one room with us, the Memphis PD they were the happiest to see us, don't you think Secretary Hegseth of anyone? We had ATF, DEA, FBI, U.S marshals, I think. I'm not sure if our park police were there. We had Treasury Secretary, Bessent, and of course we had Secretary Noem's, Homeland Security, all working together with the Guard. They were so happy to have us there. We've been making arrests left and right so far. We've made 562 arrests and seized 144 illegal guns just in the short time we've been in Memphis.\n\nPresident Trump (26:12):\n\nAnd many of these people are career criminals. And when you take them out of a place, your crime rate just goes down. These people commit crimes every single day. They're sick and we are taking them out. In some cases, we're bringing them back to their countries where Biden allowed with the stupid open borders that we had in our country to come in, but they're being brought back to other places or they're being put in jail, but they're career criminals.\n\nPam Bondi (26:38):\n\nPresident Trump, last night alone, we made 91 arrests, 19 firearms off the streets, and one was a warrant for a homicide and four sex offenders who had active warrants. One was a sex offender on a child. Everything we did in Memphis was worth it, in my opinion, for that one arrest. Think about that. We got a child rapist off the streets, but yet we've made 562 arrests and still going strong in Memphis, just what we did in D.C., but it's because it's all of us. It's a team working for you to make America safe all together round the clock\n\nPresident Trump (27:16):\n\nThank you very much. Thank you, Pam. You're doing a great job. And it's amazing that we're not getting cooperation from Democrats. It's like it's a new issue. We have all the old issues of the wall and the border and all of the things that men playing in women's sports who they still want that transgender for everybody. All these issues are so crazy, but we have a new one. It's called crime. We stop crime, and they allow crime. They want crime. It doesn't make sense. I think it's as ridiculous as the other things that we talk about all the time, but I've added it onto our list, a five letter word called crime. We stop it and they actually incite it. It's crazy. You would think they'd want them, you'd think they'd want Kristi and Pam and all of the people. If we needed the military, Pete will be there. We've got a massive military. We have the best numbers we've ever had for recruitment. We have a lot of people now. We have people that can't get into them…\n\n(28:15)In a great economy, they want to be soldiers again. A year ago, they didn't want to even think about it. Same thing as with police and firemen, everything they want to join. They're proud of our country. Again. Kristi, go ahead, please.\n\nKristi Noem (28:27):\n\nWell, sir, thank you for your leadership and for deploying all of government to help us keep our country safe. You have talked extensively about how threatened our ICE officers are, but all of our law enforcement out there, and we saw the shooting in Dallas at that facility, so we're hardening all of our buildings and making sure that we have more security measures, snipers on the roof, people to protect our law enforcement while they're out there on the streets. But what I'm also doing, sir, is and with your authority is we're purchasing more buildings in Chicago to operate out of. We're going to not back off. In fact, we're doubling down and we're going to be in more parts of Chicago in response to the people there. And then I was there a few days ago and looked at some facilities that we can deploy more law enforcement out of because what they're trying to do with these riots and violence is distract us and keep us from going after those murderers and rapists that are out in the streets.\n\n(29:23)And then I was in Portland, went out and back on Tuesday and met with the governor, met with the mayor, met with the chief of police and the superintendent of the highway patrol. They're all lying and disingenuous and dishonest people because as soon as you leave the room, then they make the exact opposite response. So we're looking at new facilities to purchase there in Portland too, and we're going to double down. And I told them if they didn't meet our demands for safety and security on the streets and work with us, then we were going to bring in more federal law enforcement. So I want to thank Pete and the Department of War for all their help. They've been fantastic, but while we fight litigation and work with Pam on that, we're going to send more of our resources and men and women out there to keep everybody safe. So no worries. What we see in D.C. and what we see in Memphis for benefits for people in the safety and security, we'll see that in Chicago and Portland.\n\nPresident Trump (30:21):\n\nAnd the numbers in Memphis, it's only a week, but the numbers have been amazing I understand.\n\nKristi Noem (30:26):\n\nThat's exactly right.\n\nPresident Trump (30:27):\n\nThe crime numbers are way down.\n\nKristi Noem (30:28):\n\nFantastic. And it shows what a partnership can be between local law enforcement and the federal government. And if we have to do it the hard way in Portland and Chicago, we will. But the people demand the safety.\n\nPam Bondi (30:39):\n\nMy lawyers are in court right now as we speak for you arguing in Chicago and Portland to keep them safe, to bring in the guard.\n\nPresident Trump (30:47):\n\nThat's good.\n\nPam Bondi (30:49):\n\nThe government doesn't want it there, but we do. We're going to keep those citizens safe thanks to you.\n\nPresident Trump (30:53):\n\nThe people want it. I don't understand the politics of it. I don't understand why Pritzker is trying to protect people that are really bad.\n\nKristi Noem (31:00):\n\nThey're more scared of the anarchists that are on the street and the politics of it than they are of doing the right thing.\n\nPresident Trump (31:07):\n\nI think they're afraid. I think they're threatened. They don't tell us. But I think Pritzker is threatened by people, because there's no other reason that this could be possible, that they don't want to have a safe Chicago and we can solve the problem very quickly. And we're doing that anyway, regardless of if he doesn't want it or if he does want it, we're doing it anyway. So make sure-\n\nKristi Noem (31:26):\n\nI asked the mayor that himself. He said that Portland was perfectly safe, a beautiful city, no problems. And I said, \"Well, why did you clear the streets for me today then? And build out a four block radius to make sure I could get in and out of here. And these people on the street screaming death to ICE. There's graffiti that says, 'Molotov's melt ICE.' We have the guillotines, we're going to use them.'\" The things that-\n\nPresident Trump (31:49):\n\nWhat was done was different it's like anarchists.\n\nKristi Noem (31:51):\n\nIt is. It really is.\n\nPresident Trump (31:51):\n\nIt's really different than a lot of the others. This is a sick situation. But those are anarchists. Those are people that want to overthrow government. They're really degenerates and we're finding out who is supplying all of those beautiful signs and everything else.\n\nKristi Noem (32:06):\n\nThat's been fantastic. His team, finding the financial networks is great. That's what gives everybody-\n\nPresident Trump (32:13):\n\nScott will do that. That's easy for Scott.\n\nMarco Rubio (32:15):\n\nWe got a great team, sir.\n\nPresident Trump (32:17):\n\nThat's good. How about we go to Marco? You could talk a little bit about what's going on and go ahead.\n\nMarco Rubio (32:24):\n\nYeah, Mr. President, I don't know if the one day, perhaps the entire story will be told about the events of yesterday, but I suffice it to say it's not an exaggeration that none of it would've been possible without the President of the United States being involved. It really began with your trip to the Middle East where these relationships were forged with partners in the region, personal relationships, close relationships that created the foundation where all of this was possible. Where I think this really took a turn, remember a month ago, I never thought this was possible. Where it really took a turn about a month ago, less than a couple of weeks ago, is when we were at the United Nations and you convened in historic meeting, not simply of Arab countries, but of Muslim-majority countries from around the world, including Indonesia, was there, Pakistan was there, and created this coalition behind this plan.\n\n(33:18)Then on that following Monday, you met with the Prime Minister of Israel here, and that plan was presented. And then of course, our great negotiating team followed up on it. In the interim, again, perhaps the stories will be told, perhaps it will never be told. The President had some extraordinary phone calls and meetings-\n\nPresident Trump (33:39):\n\nThat's true.\n\nMarco Rubio (33:40):\n\nThat required a high degree of intensity and commitment and made this happen. And I think what's important to understand is that yesterday what happened was really a human story. There's a geopolitical aspect to it. There's no doubt about it. It creates the conditions for Gaza to one day be a normal place again, and people to have a better life and Israelis to be safe. But yesterday was a human story. And because of the work you put it.\n\n(34:04)And honestly, not only is there no other leader in the world that could have put this together, Mr. President, but frankly, I don't know of any American president in the modern era that could have made this possible because of the actions you have taken unrelated to this and because of who you are and what you've done and how you're viewed. And this weekend because of that, at some point very soon, we are going to see 20 living human beings emerge from the darkness into the light for the first time in two years. And that is because not only you used the credibility and the power and the prestige of this office and the relationships you created and you committed yourself to making it happen. And I think it will go down as a historic moment in the history of our country and something our country should be very proud of, that we have a president that's committed to not just peace, but to the human aspect of reuniting these families.\n\n(34:53)My last point on this is just a couple of days ago, Secretary Lutnick hosted us all, many of us at the Kennedy Center, and we had these families, we've interacted with them for so many years, for two years now. And the stories are heartbreaking both whose families are alive and those who were deceased as well, who want their relatives back so that they can complete the process of grieving. And we had all hoped that perhaps that was the day that we would have an announcement for them on the anniversary of the seventh. But I know you were able to speak to some of those families last night. And I just hope the whole nation understands how incredibly proud they should be of their president and of their country for the role that they've played. And I don't want to let this moment pass Mr. President with also noting the incredible work of Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner.\n\n(35:38)They're an incredible team working together, facing some substantial impediments to even being there this weekend and doing it. Let me just leave it at that. And they've done a great job on your behalf, Mr. president. They deserve a tremendous amount of credit. But thank you for what you've done for the world, for the world.\n\nPresident Trump (35:56):\n\nThank you very much, Mark. I appreciate it. I think because we have a very busy day\n\nPresident Trump (36:00):\n\n… with all that's going on, what we'll do is maybe just a few of you raise your hand if you'd like to say something that… Don't talk too long. He's doing such a great job. So good that he could talk all day. That's the problem, right? And what we'll do is just take a few hands and then we'll go back to getting peace done, okay? We'll go a little bit quicker. We'll take a few questions from the press. Go ahead, please.\n\nSpeaker 3 (36:26):\n\nPresident Trump, I just want to double down on what Marco was sharing is such a remarkable accomplishment. Agree that no other president could have done this, but what set the groundwork for you able to do that? When you took office on January 20th, you made a hundred eighty-degree turn in our military strength with Pete's leadership. You were the master class in peace through strength. So militarily, we've completely turned around. We've demonstrated that through execution against Iran and others that we have force. We want to end wars, but we'll use power if we have to. And then secondarily, peace through strength is also the prosperity, having the strongest economy and willing to wield the power of a tariff in addition to the military power to reorder the globe. Those two things that you're standing on, both economic power and military power allowed these negotiations to go forward.\n\n(37:20)And I think as you've described, the importance of these economic negotiations and all the trade deals, but that also begins with another a hundred eighty-degree turn and that was a hundred eighty-degree turn on energy. You have used energy diplomacy to bring prosperity of the American people and you've used it to bring peace abroad. The combination of those three things have been remarkable and now we're seeing the remarkable result. And we've got one more that I know you want to end with Russia and Ukraine. Energy's going to play a key role in that. And now with this historic agreement, we're in a position working with the Middle East to also and the Russian-Ukraine conflict. So again, congratulations.\n\nPresident Trump (37:55):\n\nThank you very much. I appreciate it. Maybe I'll go to you for a second. You can just cap out what he said about the military, how well we're doing and how big it is and how strong it is.\n\nSpeaker 4 (38:07):\n\nMr. President, you're exactly right at the War Department, you don't get peace without strength. And our job is to be the strength part of the equation and deliver that when necessary as you demonstrated with your order of Midnight Hammer and the entire world saw. And I just want to echo what Marco said. It is a personal honor to be able to witness the way you lead and negotiate. I wish people had a full understanding of what that looks like, that historic nature. A lot of us vets, the vice president, Tulsi, Lee, Doug, probably after decades of war and the chaos that was unleashed through reckless and foolish American policies, never thought this kind of peace would be possible. Yet with your strength, with your ability to wield trade negotiations, personal relationships, to open up that opportunity is truly historic on the world stage. And it creates a whole number of other cascading effects.\n\n(39:05)And watching Marco and the vice president and Steve and Jared, the CIA director, everybody come together to make it happen, you've formed a phenomenal team, Mr. President. And at the War Department, our job is to make sure if and when there's question about American commitment, the whole world knows we've got the biggest, strongest, most lethal and most ready War Department in the world. Which is true, which is why you've seen… We saw record recruitment in 2025, Mr. President, the first two weeks of 2026 already blows that out. FY 2026 already blows it out of the water. In fact, re-enlistment has already made its year-long goal in the Marine Corps in 2026.\n\nPresident Trump (39:44):\n\n[inaudible 00:39:46].\n\nSpeaker 4 (39:46):\n\n2 weeks. Okay. There's no other way to create that kind of love and enthusiasm than with your leadership, sir. And it is an honor to work with Pam and with Kristi in the cities across the country to make sure American citizens and law enforcement are protected with our National Guard. But that's a core mission. And last thing, Mr. President, on the Southwest border, the first group that rotated in to lock down that border to zero crossings is now rotating out. And with a new border medal, the Southwest border medal, or it's actually called the Mexican Border Medal revived from 1918 that will be pinning on their chest. So thank you for renaming the department and we're trying to live up to it every day. Thank you, sir.\n\nPresident Trump (40:25):\n\nI mean, think of this, we have record numbers of recruitment. One year ago, there was stories, front page stories that we couldn't get anybody to join the army, navy, air force, marines, coast guard, my beautiful… I call it our beautiful space force. I love our space force. It's turned out to be very important, but we couldn't get anybody to join. Nobody wanted to join, including our police and fire. They didn't want join anything. Recruitment was embarrassing. We couldn't get anybody. And now we're brimming and they're getting in based on merit now. A soldier is a soldier if they come in now based on merit, not based on woke stuff that anybody can qualify. You have to qualify for jobs, you have to qualify for certain types of jobs and it's amazing. So we were embarrassed a year ago, I think of it a little bit more than a year ago. A year ago, I think it stopped on November 5th. I think this all started on November 5th, the election day. But now everybody wants to be in, we have an overabundance and maybe we should raise it a little bit. I don't know.\n\nSpeaker 4 (41:34):\n\nI like that idea, sir.\n\nPresident Trump (41:35):\n\nWe could raise it. But we have so many people want to join and they're proud of our country again. JD, could I ask you to say any words?\n\nSpeaker 5 (41:43):\n\nYes, sir. So just a couple of things. First of all, congratulations on yesterday. It was a big day to Marco, to Susie, to the entire team, but in particular viewing it from this perspective where for months the fake news media attacked you, attacked the entire team, attacked your approach. The definition of insanity is to do the same thing again and again expecting a different result. The reason we're here is because the president actually charted a different course with a different team. He vested a lot of authority into Steve Witkoff in particular, and that's why we're here. It's because you did something different. And I think it's important to recognize that. Marco mentioned the president's personal touch being a big part of this. The one thing I would say is obviously the President of the United States, a New York real estate billionaire, one of the most famous New Yorkers in the world, has a lot of interaction with a lot of people who are very pro-Israel.\n\n(42:32)I think that was an important set of experiences and life experiences that he brought to the table. He also, of course, knew one of the most famous Palestinians in the world, Chuck Schumer. And I think without that background of knowledge, it would've been impossible to get us to this [inaudible 00:42:46]. Second thing I would say, just on Chuck Schumer, the president mentioned this, that Chuck Schumer said, \"This has been very good for us,\" this morning about the shutdown. One of the things that we talked about before all the media came in and that all of us are going to work on for the rest of the day we've been working on for days, is how to make the shutdown as painless as possible on the American people. So while Chuck Schumer brags about this being good, and I think the president is right, it's not good for him politically as much as he might think that it is, it's causing real consequences for the American people.\n\n(43:17)There's a low-income food program, the WIC program that my mom actually used when I was a baby. That program is about to be underfunded and it's about to get cut off because Chuck Schumer won't open the government. We have troops, Secretary of War mentioned how well we're doing on recruitment. We're trying to figure out how to pay our troops because Chuck Schumer is shutting down the US government. There are veterans benefits that are going to suffer. There are Americans that are going to suffer because Chuck Schumer refuses to do his job. So while we're all celebrating this incredible success that we've had on the world stage, the country could be doing so much better if Chuck Schumer did his job and opened the government. Every single Republican except for Rand Paul has voted to open the government. A few moderate Democrats, to their credit, have voted with us to open the government. We just need five more Democrats to come to their senses and let the people's government serve the American people. I hope that they'll do that.\n\nPresident Trump (44:12):\n\nThank you very much. Chris Wright.\n\nSpeaker 6 (44:14):\n\nYeah, I had to follow up on that point, Mr. President. The Democrat or Schumer shutdown did not begin eight or nine days ago. It began eight or nine months ago with your inauguration. For the first time in American history, every Senate confirmed appointee who are our deputies to run our department, every one of them has been filibustered. One of the critical parts of my department is the National Nuclear Security Administration. It maintains manufactures our nuclear weapons and our engines for nuclear submarines and nuclear aircraft carriers. We are a key supplier to Secretary of War, Pete Hegseth. The Democrats filibustered the leader, the administrator of the National Nuclear Security Administration would not let him come into my department until the Republicans two weeks ago changed the Senate rules so they could confirm them and we could have a leader.\n\n(45:07)They filibustered the leadership, now they're filibustering the funding. And the next six, seven days we're going to run out of funding and the retooling of our nuclear stockpile, the ultimate guarantor of our sovereignty is going to be underfunded and we're going to have to slow down and creep to us, crawl these efforts. Just incredibly irresponsible for Schumer to worry about his own reelection and not the 340 million Americans that count on the efforts of our military and all of our departments. It's truly offensive and we need to bring it to an end as soon as possible. Let's open the government back up.\n\nPresident Trump (45:41):\n\nAnd you're doing a great job. Thank you very much. Robbie, did you want to say something? You got a lot of things happening. A lot of very positive things actually.\n\nSpeaker 7 (45:49):\n\nMr. President, I'm glad you're getting bipartisan accolades on the Mideast Peace agreement. You should also get bipartisan accolades on the MFN agreement. It is a historic agreement that's going to benefit every hardworking American. It's going to lower the price of drugs for every American. By the time this administration is over, we will have 95% of the drugs in this country will be the lowest price in the world. It immediately begins to affect Medicaid, Medicare, Social Security, the other government programs. I remember when I went through the confirmation process and the principle preoccupation of the Democrats during that process was whether I would continue the IRA negotiations on drugs. The Democrats negotiated 10 drugs. I'm supposed to negotiate every year, 15. 10 that they negotiated, they claimed to get a 22% reduction, but it was a lie. It was 22% under the list price, which was actually higher than the price we were getting. Medicaid, Medicare ended up paying more for those drugs than they were paying beforehand. They only got a benefit on one drug, one was tied, eight of them were lower. So they should be applauding what we're doing now. We're doing something that every administration, Democrat and Republican, has been saying that it was going to do for decades. And you got it done because you understood the power of the tariffs that we had leverage over these companies. And you did it in a way which you asked us to do, to negotiate in a way that was not going to stifle innovation, that was going to make sure that those companies could bring their production home and they are doing that. And it was a profound success. It will affect every American for a hundred years and you should be getting bipartisan accolades on… I'll say one other thing about Tylenol only because of this.\n\n(47:57)This morning before I came in here, somebody showed me a TikTok video of a pregnant woman, eight months pregnant. She is an associate professor at the Columbia Medical School and she is saying, \"F Trump,\" and gobbling Tylenol with her baby in her placenta. And the level of Trump derangement syndrome has now left political landscapes and it is now in the realm of pathology. And a mother could overwhelm millions of years of maternal instinct to put her baby at risk and all you have to do is look at the studies which you and I talked about. It's not this positive that cause autism, but it is so suggestive that anybody who takes the stuff during pregnancy unless they have to, is irresponsible. There are 15 rodent studies. Every one of them shows if you give it to the mother, the babies and particularly the male babies have profound neurological behavioral changes.\n\n(49:05)There is a study from Johns Hopkins on core blood where they divided women into three categories. Those who had the least acetaminophen in their core blood and those who had the most. The ones with the most had 3.6 times the rate of autism in their children. The middle category had 2.2 times. So it's a dose related response. And there are dozens of studies that show the countries that use the most have the highest level of autism. Cuba has the lowest level in the world of acetaminophen use and it has the lowest autism rate in the world. This is not just positive, it is not proof. We're doing the studies to make the proof, but in the meantime, the precautionary principle should apply and any mother who is taking this stuff during pregnancy just to get back at Donald Trump, is doing something that is pathological and we're seeing that across the board. I got a lot of other stuff to talk about, but I know we got a short time here but thank you, Mr. President. You're making our country healthier again.\n\nPresident Trump (50:09):\n\nThank you, Robbie. Could you just say for the record, state what the autism was, let's say 20 years ago and what it is today?\n\nSpeaker 7 (50:17):\n\nIn 1970, the largest epidemiological study in history was performed. 900,000 kids were looked at. They were looking for autism in Wisconsin children. They looked at every child in Wisconsin who was eight years old. They found an autism rate of 0.7 per 10,000. So almost close to one in 20,000, less than one in 10,000. Today the autism rates are nationally, one in 31, but it's actually much worse than that. Because California, which has the best collection system reports an autism rate of one in every 19 children, one in every 12.5 boys. It is a national security issue. There is nothing more important and I'm glad, I'm grateful to you for it, Mr. President, because you know the flack that you take for even talking about this issue. You've shown courage and you've shown leadership and I can't thank you enough for letting me do this work.\n\nPresident Trump (51:17):\n\nThank you. So think of that, one in 20,000 and now it's one in 12 for boys, one in 18, 19 for girls. So obviously there's something that's artificially, I think, induce something. Whether it's the vaccines in terms of these massive vaccines that are twice the size of a jar like that, of a glass of water like that into a baby's body. And I've suggested get them in doses, get them in maybe 20%, 30%, but smaller, not such a big… I think that we had certain recommendations, the MMR, take them separately. The measles is already separate now and it works out much better, but it doesn't seem to be any impact if you take it separately. If you take it as a combination, it's not so great and some other things. But I would say don't take Tylenol if you're pregnant and when the baby is born, don't give it Tylenol. If you can avoid it at all, just don't give a Tylenol.\n\nSpeaker 7 (52:24):\n\nI'll say this-\n\nPresident Trump (52:26):\n\nWhat do you have to lose? You really don't have much to lose.\n\nSpeaker 7 (52:29):\n\nAlso, just there's many, many other confirmation studies. There's two studies that show children who are circumcised early have double the rate of autism and it's highly likely because they're given Tylenol. So none of this is this positive, but all of it is stuff that we should be paying attention to.\n\nPresident Trump (52:51):\n\nBut there's a tremendous amount of proof or evidence. I would say as a non-doctor, but I've studied this a long time ago. I met Bobby in my office 20 years ago. We were talking about the same thing 20 years ago, and I was a real estate developer. It bothered me that it seemed to be getting worse, but it's so bad now when you hear these numbers, it's not even really sustainable. I don't know how people do it, but there is some very strong evidence on Tylenol. In fact, at one point, I guess the company gave a warning. They gave a…\n\nSpeaker 7 (53:24):\n\nThey still don't recommend it during pregnancy. That's the weird thing.\n\nPresident Trump (53:28):\n\nThey're not recommending it and that's the company itself. So just don't take it. Don't take it if you're a woman, don't take it and don't give it to the baby when the baby's born. And I think that's going to have an impact. But I'd also get the shots in smaller doses. And there are a few things, we gave a few things that just seemed to be… And I think you'd get that number way back up. Think of it, you have one in 20,000 and it's not even believable when you\n\nPresident Trump (54:00):\n\nWhen you think the 20,000 drops to 12. 12 children. So that's induced by something that's given or taken and it should be able to be stopped. And you're talking about the Pennsylvania Dutch, you were talking about the Amish, where they don't take any of this stuff and they have virtually none. Right? They have no autism. No autism. So we're doing something very bad. Somebody's been given some bad things. Other countries, by the way, we have, I think, we have 82 vaccines that we give. And I'm a vaccine believer, by the way. I believe in the polio vaccine. I believe in a lot of vaccines, but when you give 82 vaccines in a shot to a little baby that hasn't even formed yet, it's a lot of vaccines. And in Japan they give a much smaller number. In Germany, they give a much smaller, like 28 vaccines. It's a lot too, but 28s a lot different than 82. But I would say, on the Tylenol, don't take it. And that, I think, it's going to be a big factor. I think it'll be a very good result and I hope we're going to be able to see that result in the not too distant future. Because certainly people have heard us loud and clear. That's why I bring it up again. That's why I asked you to talk about it, because this is a horrible thing and if you don't take it, I mean you have to tough it through sometimes. There are other things you can do, but you have to tough it out. It's easy for me to say. But I think you're going to see numbers that, it will be so significantly improved and maybe fully improved. I mean, there's something there. There's something going on and we have to address it. And so I'm addressing it the best I can as a non-doctor, but I'm a man of common sense. Okay, any other questions?\n\nSpeaker 8 (55:55):\n\nI'd like to comment on the workforce.\n\nPresident Trump (55:56):\n\nYeah, please.\n\nSpeaker 9 (55:56):\n\nMr. President, a lot of people are calling to give you the Nobel Peace Prize after this peace deal that you managed to achieve in the Middle East. First of all, your opinion on that, and I was wondering about your trip to the Middle East. If you can tell us if you are considering to speak at the Knesset, at the Israeli Parliament.\n\nPresident Trump (56:13):\n\nWell, they asked me to speak at the Knesset and I've agreed to, if they would like me to, I will do it. It's the first time a president has ever done that, so that makes it very interesting. Right?\n\nSpeaker 9 (56:25):\n\nYeah. Of course.\n\nPresident Trump (56:25):\n\nBut yeah, so I will do it if they want me to. They have asked me to do that. Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 9 (56:32):\n\nFamilies of hostages are out in the streets in Israel, dancing and crying tears of joy.\n\nPresident Trump (56:35):\n\nThey're all dancing in the streets. Right now, they're dancing in the streets. They're so happy. Everybody's happy. They're dancing in the streets of Arab countries, Muslim countries. I've never seen anything like it. Everybody is happy. It's been really amazing. Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 10 (56:52):\n\nPresident Trump on the international peacekeeping force that's going to deploy to Gaza soon, do you expect that Pakistan, Turkey, other countries to contribute forces, has that become formed up and also the shutdown? It seems like in the house there's a majority support for temporary extension of the Obamacare subsidies perhaps minus the funds for illegal immigrants. Is that how you see the deal to end the shutdown happening?\n\nPresident Trump (57:16):\n\nWell, I see the deal just getting extended as we continue to talk, but we're willing to pay because we're paying. It's very simple. We're paying. The Democrats are the ones that caused this problem and it's a big problem for them and they have a lot of break in their ranks, so I see that. I think that'll get worked out, but we want to get back before we do this. We don't want to have a gun held to our head. We don't like that. And the public doesn't like it either. So we want to get back and I think it's going to work out. I think it's going to work out very well. It's something that shouldn't have happened. This was supposed to take place before the election. This was supposed to take place on September 28th before the election. We shouldn't even be talking about this right now. This is actually something that shouldn't have even happened. Yeah, please.\n\nSpeaker 11 (58:04):\n\nMr. President looking ahead, what guarantees Hamas disarms and that Israel doesn't resume bombing once the hostages are released?\n\nPresident Trump (58:10):\n\nWell, the first thing we're doing is getting our hostages back and that's what people wanted more than anything else. They wanted these hostages back that have lived in hell like nobody has ever even dreamt possible. And after that, we'll see, but they've agreed to things and I think it's going to move along pretty well.\n\nSpeaker 11 (58:31):\n\nBut what is phase two?\n\nPresident Trump (58:33):\n\nWell, I'm not going to talk about that because you sort of know what phase two is, but there will be disarming, there will be pullbacks, there'll be a lot of things that are happening. I gave you a whole list of 22 different things that will take place and I think it'll take place and I think you can end up with peace in the Middle East, but we have to get our hostages back and we weren't going to do it at the end. We're going to do it at the beginning. We said we want them at the beg… We got the hostages back. We did as a group, with Steve and Jared and Marco and me and all of us.\n\n(59:06)We got the hostages back. We got many of them back. Many unfortunately were dead, but we got many back that are now living with their families, with their parents in many cases and with their husbands, families, wives, many of them, they celebrate all over. They're the ones that are celebrating the loudest. They're all over. There are a lot of them that we got out, but the last 20, and I always said the last ones are going to be the most difficult, but it's been a very big deal getting the hostages out, but the rest is going to take place too.\n\nSpeaker 11 (59:43):\n\nAnd can you promise Palestinians they will be able to stay?\n\nPresident Trump (59:48):\n\nWell, they know exactly what we're doing. We're going to create something where people can live. You can't live right now in Gaza. The places, it's a horrible situation. Nobody's ever seen anything like it. So yeah, we're going to create better conditions for people. Yeah, please.\n\nSpeaker 12 (01:00:04):\n\nMr. President. Excuse me. What kind of security guarantees is the United States going to make for Gaza?\n\nPresident Trump (01:00:09):\n\nWell, we're going to work with very wealthy countries that love people, frankly. I know them very well. They love people, but they love Arab people and they love Muslims and I think right now they love everybody and they're immensely wealthy and they're going to be involved in putting up money and for them it's a small amount of money. For somebody else, it's a large amount of money, but these are the wealthiest countries in the world and they'll be very much involved in making it as good as possible.\n\nSpeaker 12 (01:00:40):\n\nWhat's your take now on the two-state solutions, sir? Just to follow up on that.\n\nPresident Trump (01:00:43):\n\nOn what?\n\nSpeaker 12 (01:00:44):\n\nWhat is your view now on a two-state solution today?\n\nPresident Trump (01:00:46):\n\nI don't have a view. I'm going to go with what they agree to.\n\nSpeaker 13 (01:00:50):\n\nMr. president. Given that there are some tough provisions for Israel in this agreement, are you at all concerned that Bibi Netanyahu may not continue on his post [inaudible 01:01:01]?\n\nPresident Trump (01:01:01):\n\nThat Bibi may go a little bit out of whack?\n\nSpeaker 13 (01:01:05):\n\nThat he may no longer be prime minister?\n\nPresident Trump (01:01:09):\n\nLook, that's politics. It could be. I don't know. I think he's very popular right now. He's much more popular today than he was five days ago. I can tell you that. Right now, I think maybe people shouldn't run against him. Five days ago it might not have been a bad idea. This has been a very good thing. I don't think he did it for that reason, okay, but I think just looking as an analyst would look at this. I think Bibi should be very popular right now. Yeah, please.\n\nSpeaker 14 (01:01:40):\n\nWhat will happen if Hamas says that it cannot locate or was not able to find all the deceased hostages bodies within the timeframe?\n\nPresident Trump (01:01:46):\n\nWell, we'll have to see. I think that's largely been answered. We know where most of them are. Actually the bodies are a bigger problem because some of the bodies are going to be a little bit hard to find. It's a terrible thing to discuss even. But you understand we're all people, we're grownups. We understand life. Nobody can understand this though, because that this could have taken place, but we have the hostages for the most part. And so I don't think it's going to be overly big. The situation with the bodies, they say 28, some are going to be a little bit hard to find, but we're going to do the best we can. Yeah, please. Behind you. Yeah, behind you.\n\nSpeaker 15 (01:02:35):\n\nThank you, sir. Regarding Jared Kushner's role in negotiations, can you explain a little bit about why he came on at the last minute and then in regards to the WIIP program that the vice president mentioned, do you know on the funding that you promised through the tariff revenue will actually go through to communities reports that big providers are actually starting to close down today?\n\nPresident Trump (01:02:55):\n\nWell, okay, let me just answer the Jared. So Jared's a very smart guy. He did the Abraham Accords. Some people say the Abraham, which I love the way that sounds, but he did the Abraham Accords. It was a great thing. Four big countries joined. If I were president, if the election would've been a correct election, which it wasn't, you'd have every country and then maybe even Iran would've been in there frankly. But you'd have every country and now, by the way, that's going to be filled up rather quickly. People want to join the Abraham Accords and I put Jared there because he's a very smart person and he knows the region, knows the people, knows a lot of the players and the combination of him and Steve Witkoff and Marco and Cooper who as I hear has been fantastic and others that were involved.\n\n(01:03:53)JD was very much involved. I mean we had a very smart group of people working. We had a lot of different players, different countries and very diverse countries, very different from each other. They had certain things in common, but they had a lot of things, mostly things that were not at all common to their country. So we had a very smart group of people. These are high IQ people. Okay? I talk about how many low IQ people we have in our government. We got some real low ones, but some shockingly low. But these are very high IQ people and that's what we want. I like high IQ people.\n\nSpeaker 16 (01:04:31):\n\nMr. President. Thank you. Can I ask you about the China. You're meeting with President Xi, the Chinese have now set to put in new export controls on rare-earth minerals and they've stopped buying soybeans from the U.S. What do you hope to get out of that meeting now with President Xi?\n\nPresident Trump (01:04:44):\n\nWell, we'll see. I mean I just heard this a little while ago before we came in, so I haven't been briefed on it. The export, I mean, look, we have the ultimate export. We have import and we have export. We import from China, massive amounts and maybe we'll have to stop doing that, but I don't know exactly what it is. Neither do you. Neither does anybody. It's a little bit soon. I just heard about it. So Scott and Howard will figure that out and I'm sure we'll be able to handle it.\n\nSpeaker 16 (01:05:17):\n\nCan I ask you about the soybeans. What is the plan to help farmers? Is it direct checks? Is it tax, have you sorted that out yet?\n\nPresident Trump (01:05:23):\n\nWell, what happens with soybeans is we're going to see more and more I think opening up. And part of the reason, he's got things that he wants to discuss with me and I have things that I want to discuss with him. And one of the things is soybeans. I had a great deal with China where they would buy $50 billion worth of our farm product and manufacturing and other things, but farm product and it was going along well. Then when the election turned out to be a rigged election and we had the wrong guy get in there, he didn't do anything about it. I used to call up President Xi every two weeks or I'd call up people in China and say, you got to keep going. You're not buying the amount that you agreed to. And this went on ever since we signed the agreement.\n\n(01:06:05)It was a great agreement. So they used to do 15 billion and I got it up to 50 billion. 50. And it was great. Then when Biden got in, they just never adhered to the agreement and nobody in Biden's group, as you can imagine did anything about it. So it just sat there for four years and they didn't adhere to the agreement and it's hard to go back after four years of nobody calling them, but I used to call them every two weeks. I'd say, you're a little low. Or I appreciated [inaudible 01:06:38]. Oftentimes I'd say, thank you very much. You are totally adhering to the agreement, but we had an agreement they would buy $50 billion worth of our product, mostly farm product. And the farmer, you remember I said to the farmers, buy larger tractors and more land. And that's exactly what happened. They did well, but we do suffer. I'd like you to discuss that maybe for a second, Brooke, very quickly, by the way.\n\nBrooke (01:07:00):\n\nYes, sir.\n\nPresident Trump (01:07:02):\n\nBut would you just talk about how Biden let us down. Biden, every single thing, every problem the farmer has is because Biden didn't do anything for four years. Go ahead.\n\nBrooke (01:07:14):\n\nNo, I think that's right. This president has been unequivocal in his support of the farmers. First of all, in term one, we worked on it so hard and opened up markets, but especially this term. But here's what everyone has to understand. The farm economy is in a very uncertain time, but that isn't because of the current trade negotiations, although certainly the China part is part of that. But we inherited a slew of issues. First of all, as the president said, when we left, Trump one, we had an agriculture trade surplus when we came back for Trump two, it was a fifty-billion-dollar ag deficit. That isn't everything. That's just agriculture. The second part is the cost of inputs for our farmers increased on average between 30 and 38%. But that includes fertilizer, it includes fuel, it includes interest rates, it includes labor. All of this came about under Joe Biden, a 47% increase in the cost of labor that now Secretary Chavez-DeRemer and Noem and I are working on. Fuel is coming down.\n\n(01:08:14)Thank you. Interest rates, thankfully are coming down to 73% increase in interest rates for our farmers. They couldn't get loans to make sure that they could move forward. So that's all really, really important. And I think we have to realize what the president's commitment is, is this, that we are moving into an era of rural prosperity, of a golden age for our farmers in rural America. The trade re-negotiations and the trade realignment that Jameson and Scott and Howard have led with the President's leadership is unlike anything that's happened in the history of our country.\n\n(01:08:46)And those that will benefit the most are the original Americans, our farmers, and our ranchers. The president has committed if we need a bridge, he has talked about that to get us from the Biden years to the new Trump era, that's what we're working on every day. We've got to get the government reopened so that we can move forward on that, and once we do, we'll be able to move out a significant program to help our farmers. Long-term, have to change this hamster wheel of government. We've got to ensure that the farmers have the market to sell and it's a national security issue in on-shoring a lot of the food as well. Thank you.\n\nPresident Trump (01:09:23):\n\nThank you. Thank you everybody. I think that's enough.\n\nSpeaker 17 (01:09:26):\n\nThank you press, thank you, press. Let's go. Thank you.\n\nPresident Trump (01:09:27):\n\nThe country is doing very well. Thank you very much everybody. Thank you.",

    "transcript": "Donald Trump (00:00):\n\nThank you very much. I was just dealing with people from the Middle East, our people and other people on the potential peace deal for the Middle East. Peace for the Middle East. It's a beautiful phrase and we hope it's going to come true, but it's very close and they're doing very well. We have a great team over there, great negotiators, and there are unfortunately great negotiators on the other side also, but it's something I think that will happen, got a good chance of happening. I may go there sometime toward the end of the week, maybe on Sunday actually, and we'll see. But there's a very good chance that negotiations are going along very well. We're dealing with Hamas and many of the countries. As you know, all of the Muslim countries are included, all of the Arab countries are included, very rich countries and some that are not so rich, but just about everybody's included. It's never happened before. Nothing like that's happened before. Our final negotiation, as you know, is with Hamas, and it seems to be going well. So we'll let you know. If that's the case, we'll be leaving probably on Sunday, maybe a little later than Saturday evening. But that seems to be our schedule. It should be clear to all Americans that we have a very serious left-wing terror threat in our country. Radicals associated with the domestic terror group, Antifa, that you've heard a lot about lately, and I've heard a lot about them for 10 years. And other far-left extremists have been carrying out a campaign of violence against ICE agents and other officials charged with enforcing federal law. In Chicago, anarchists have surveilled at least four local ICE facilities and posted diagrams of the buildings online, meaning nothing but bad, accompanied by photos of specific ICE agents that they're targeting, one in particular who's a top person and a great person, a great patriot.\n\n(02:09)In July, approximately a dozen Antifa-aligned militants stormed the ICE facility in Texas and then lured officers out of the building before firing dozens of rounds at police. They were crazy, frankly. Shooting one Texas officer in the neck. And in Portland, Oregon, Antifa thugs have repeatedly attacked our officers and laid siege to federal property in an attempt to violently stop the execution of federal law. Everything we're doing is very lawful, what they're doing is not lawful and what the governor and the mayor, as an example, you could say of Portland, and you can say certainly of Chicago, it's not lawful what they're doing. They have to be very careful. In addition, two weeks ago, radical left terrorists in Dallas conducted a sniper attack on a local ICE facility, killing two people and leaving behind a note that read, \"Hopefully this will give ICE agents some real terror.\" That's bad.\n\n(03:12)This attack came the very same month that Charlie Kirk was assassinated by a far-left extremist who inscribed the words, \"Hey, fascist, catch.\" Meaning, catch the bullet, onto the bullet shelf itself. The epidemic of left- wing violence and Antifa-inspired terror has been escalating for nearly a decade. At universities, Antifa has organized riotous mobs to attack campus speakers. I see it all the time. And these are agitators, anarchists, and they're paid. You'll be finding it out very soon, you should see what we have on these people. These are bad people. These are people that want to destroy our country. We're not going to let it happen. They've used armed gangs to assault local police in cities nationwide, and they have attacked journalists reporting on their crimes. So the journalists that report on their crimes, don't worry, you're very safe. I hope that's not going to turn you around, but they have been very threatening to people, but we're going to be very threatening to them, far more threatening to them than they ever were with us. And that includes the people that fund them.\n\n(04:21)Probably some of the people I know, some of the people I dine with. But if they do, they're in deep trouble. So we're going to be looking very strongly at the people that are funding these operations. When you see the signs and they're all made out of a beautiful paper, beautiful, nice, stiff, very expensive paper with beautiful wood handles all the same, all the same color, they come from very expensive printing machines. These are not people that write out their signs in a basement that believe in something. These are paid anarchists. At least three of these courageous journalists have personally been victims of Antifa attacks. Andy Ngo has been repeatedly beaten by Antifa thugs for his work in cruel… Andy is a very serious person too, I have to tell you. I've been watching him for a long time.\n\n(05:12)Is Andy here? That's what I thought. Hello, Andy. I thought that was you. You're looking better than you do out on those streets, huh? You look much better. It's nice to have you. You feel a little safer here, I think, maybe. Well, not that safe because you have them. You have to worry about that. But thank you very much. Andy Ngo has been repeatedly beaten by Antifa and including one assault that left him with a brain hemorrhage. Only days ago, Nick Sortor was assaulted in Portland by a flag-burning mob, and we've made it one-year penalty for inciting riots. We took the freedom of speech away because that's been through the courts, and the courts said, \"You have freedom of speech.\"\n\n(05:57)But what has happened is when they burn a flag, it agitates and irritates crowds, I've never seen anything like it, on both sides, and you end up with riots. So we're going on that basis. We're looking at it, not from the freedom of speech, which I always felt strongly about, but never passed the courts. This is what they do, when you burn an American flag, you incite tremendous violence. We have many examples of it, many, many examples of it, and it's actually down on tape and you see things happen that just don't happen unless it's the flag that's burning. Very recently, Katie Daviscourt was hit in the face with a flagpole in Portland by an Antifa radical leaving her with a very blackened eye. So Katie, thank you very much. And I'd like to also say that I watched Nick. Where's Nick? Is Nick here?\n\nPam Bondi (06:49):\n\nRight there.\n\nDonald Trump (06:51):\n\nNick? Hi, Nick. That was a rough time you went through. I watched. I hope you got my little note. I wrote you a note.\n\nNick Sortor (06:57):\n\nYeah, I really appreciated that. It helped a lot because it was a difficult situation. It was very stressful and your note helped a lot. I truly appreciate you, sir.\n\nDonald Trump (07:06):\n\nI thought it was terrible, actually. I thought it was terrible. So we'll talk about it a little bit. Under the last administration, the Department of Justice targeted faithful Catholics, Christians and patriotic parents as domestic extremists, they said, \"Oh, they're extreme because they believe in God. They're extreme because they go to a Catholic Church,\" or evangelicals, where everybody was under the gun. Unless you are a really bad sick person, then they left you alone. Under the Trump administration, we're going after Antifa criminals and all who fund and support their campaigns are in serious trouble. And we have a lot of records already, a lot of bad surprises. It's people that you would never think. I want to thank Attorney General, Pam Bondi, who by the way, yesterday was incredible in Congress, who was amazing and she just did it from the heart and the brain, because she's very smart in all fairness.\n\n(08:03)But she did it from the heart and everybody was talking about it. She exposed some of these fake senators, these terrible senators, people like Blumenthal that had a phony war record. For 20 years, he talked about what a hero he was and it turned out he never went to Vietnam. For 20 years he talked about being a hero in Vietnam, then it was exposed when he said what platoon he was with and it was exposed that somebody was watching from that particular platoon. They said, \"He was never with us.\" And then he went out and he cried and he was ready to drop out of the election. Disgraceful. And then he looks at people like Pam and he starts criticizing her and she's a patriot, and they ought to do something with that. We have a young congressman that's right now in jail for lying about where he went to college and other things.\n\n(08:55)It was frankly not good. It was pretty bad, but it was nothing compared to Blumenthal. I mean, what Blumenthal did, he was for 20 years a great war hero. And then he sits back, and sanctimonious kind of a guy, looks down, \"How dare you do this to the American public?\" What a fake. But I thought Pam was incredible yesterday, as well as Secretary Kristi Noem, who's really out there courageously. I appreciate it, Kristi, amazing what you're doing.\n\n(09:23)FBI director, Kash Patel, who's really coming up with some great information, Kash, it's great. Keep it coming because there's plenty of it. Deputy Attorney General, one of the best lawyers you'll ever find. Todd Blanche, who I know personally is a good lawyer because I'm here. Thank you very much, Todd. Good job. Let me ask Attorney General Bondi to say a few words and then we'll follow it up with Secretary Noem and Director Patel. And we're going to have some of the people around the table, very courageous people, and they're going to be talking journalists, almost all, and they're going to be talking and we'll take some questions from the press at the end. Okay, Pam, please.\n\nPam Bondi (10:07):\n\nThank you, President Trump. And as you made clear, Antifa is a domestic left-wing terrorist organization. We've seen them on video for years because they wanted to be seen and they got away with it. They beat journalists, they attack courthouses, they attack police stations, they dox and assault our law enforcement officers. The Biden administration, let them commit these crimes with total impunity for years, so did Democrat leaders like Pritzker and Mayor Brandon Johnson. Last week, independent journalist, Nick Sortor, was arrested just for protecting himself against Antifa. I saw it online and I called Nick. I couldn't believe what happened. He did all this just trying to save our American flag from being burned. He was pushed down and assaulted, yet the local police arrested Nick, not the Antifa thugs who did this to him. Antifa feels empowered to operate in the open because weak Democrats have turned a blind eye to their actions, their hatred for President Trump and for law and order agendas fuels their violence.\n\n(11:18)We've seen more than a thousand percent, a thousand percent, increase in attacks against our ICE agents since January 20th. Secretary Noem is out there fighting for you firsthand to keep our federal officers safe, to keep our federal buildings safe and we're not going to have it anymore, these thugs. We saw what's happening in Portland and Chicago and you saw what happened in Dallas. No longer. This is not activism, it's anarchy. We can't and we will not let mask terrorists burn our buildings, attack our law enforcement, and intimidate our communities. Under your leadership President Trump, we're deploying the full might of the federal law enforcement to crack down on Antifa and other domestic terrorist organizations, led by Stephen Miller and Stephen, thank you for everything you're doing. Last week I issued a memo ordering our federal law enforcement agents, DEA, FBI, US Marshals and ATF to protect ICE officers from Antifa and other radical left-wing violence.\n\n(12:25)Director Patel has been going nonstop, he and Deputy Attorney General Blanche were in Chicago yesterday, while Secretary Noem was in Portland. We are around this country fighting against this domestic terrorism. We had Apple and Google take down the ICEBlock apps. Hope they continue to comply with that. It's threatening the safety of our federal law enforcement officers. We're not going to stop at just arresting the violent criminals we can see in the streets. Fighting crime is more than just getting the bad guy off the streets. It's breaking down the organization brick by brick, just like we did with cartels. We're going to take the same approach, President Trump, with Antifa, destroy the entire organization from top to bottom. We're going to take them apart. Thanks to your bold leadership and the designation of Antifa as a terrorist organization, which is exactly what they are, Americans will no longer tolerate their unhinged violence. Thank you.\n\nDonald Trump (13:33):\n\nThank you very much, Pam. Kristi.\n\nKristi Noem (13:37):\n\nWell, thank you, Mr. President, and thank you for hosting today and focusing on Antifa and the terrorists that they are. Let's not make any mistake, these individuals do not just want to threaten our law enforcement officers, threaten our journalists and the citizens of this country, they want to kill them. Their agenda is to destroy the American people and our way of life, and this president is standing in their way. He is stopping them from bringing their death, and their destruction to the individual citizens in this country that just want to raise their kids and their grandkids in peace and in safety. I want to also thank everyone around this table for being so bold and so brave, for standing up and recognizing the threat that Antifa is to our way of life, by recognizing how advanced they are, how sophisticated their networks are, how they've infiltrated our entire country, and we're seeing them play out with their tactics from city to city and how they have built out their funding mechanisms.\n\n(14:32)And sir, I also want to thank our treasury secretary for his work and getting to the bottom of these funding mechanisms and individuals who are perpetuating this violence on our American cities. I was in Portland yesterday and had the chance to visit with the governor of Oregon and also the mayor there in town, and they are absolutely covering up the terrorism that is hitting their streets. While you talked about some of the stories of our ICE agents, our border patrol agents, how they have been attacked, how they have been shot at, injured, the damage that they've done, these leaders in these local cities, along with Pritzker and Johnson, ignore what's going on. Or sir, they're helping Antifa cover it up. We have arrested dozens of individuals that are Antifa members or affiliated with them, and I want to thank our Attorney General for prosecuting them and making sure they never see the light of day again.\n\n(15:25)They have been so bold in making sure we're bringing those individuals to justice. One of the individuals we arrested recently in Portland was the girlfriend of one of the founders of Antifa. And we are hoping that as we go after her, interview her and prosecute her, we will get more and more information about the network and how we can root them out and eliminate them from the existence of American society. I want to thank the new journalists here today for telling their stories and for being able and willing to go to the streets and to cover what's happening here in America. Many times the legacy media has looked the other way, refused to tell the stories, the networks have not really focused on what this is and what damage it is doing to our country and how this network of Antifa is just as sophisticated as MS-13, as TDA, as ISIS, as Hezbollah, as Hamas, as all of them.\n\n(16:16)They are just as dangerous, they have an agenda to destroy us just like the other terrorists we've dealt with for many, many years. And today is the day that we have a president that won't tolerate it and will stand up and fight for the American people. So thank you for being here, for being so bold and for standing in the gap at such a time as this. It will matter. It will make a difference and your life will be one of significance because of what you've done today. So with that, God bless you and thank you, Mr. President.\n\nDonald Trump (16:42):\n\nThank you very much. Thank you. Kash, please.\n\nKash Patel (16:46):\n\nThank you, Mr. President. Mr. President, the American people gave you a sweeping mandate in your victory in this election cycle and they demanded safety and security for our citizens and your administration, with your leadership has provided us with the resources that we need, which is a whole- of-government approach to go after criminals absolutely everywhere, not just outside of this country, but within this country. And that takes a whole-of-government approach. The interagency seated up here with the Department of Homeland Security, our Attorney General, our Deputy Attorney General and your White House staffers and including Stephen Miller's leadership, has allowed us to go out there and map out these networks. What we are doing at the FBI is simple, it does not require rocket science. We are following the money. Money never lies. And that's what it's going to take to bring down this network of organized criminal thugs, gang bangers, and yes, domestic terrorists because that's what they are.\n\n(17:39)They're harming everyday citizens in every single one of our communities. And the folks you see here on the right and left, they're some of the bravest men and women we have today. They're reporting the stories live time because the mainstream media won't cover it. They're putting their lives on the line, they're standing up for the flag. The least we can do is stand up for them. So you have my thanks. I read more of your stories than I do theirs because you guys are putting out the truth. And we deserve a country where you are protected as equally as they are. We in this FBI will go after the criminals with a vengeance. We will not rest until we find every single seed, money, donor, organization and funding mechanism that we have. And I want to echo the secretary's comments on Scott Bessent, who's allowing us to map out these networks through their financial criminal activities, which has been going on for decades.\n\n(18:26)And I would like to remind the American public, they built this diseased temple of corruption over decades, and in eight short months, Mr. President, you have crippled their foundation because of your leadership here, because of the interagency, because of people like Deputy Attorney General Blanche and because of Attorney General Pam Bondi's fearless leadership to go after criminals wherever they are. They will not be able to hide. They were able to hide and conspire with prior administrations and we are exposing their corruption from within. And we will go to every single city in this country under Operation Summer Heat, and the other operations we are doing at the FBI to bring these criminals to justice. We will arrest every single one of them from whatever perch you sit in, private or public, no matter how high your goal or your ambition is, it will be crushed by the Constitution because the American people deserve law and order, and that's what we're going to give you.\n\nDonald Trump (19:14):\n\nThank you very much, Kash. Great job. Maybe we'll start over here. Would any of you like to say something? Feel free. You can say it in front of a fine group of people, also, journalists and reporters. Do you want to start?\n\nKash Patel (19:30):\n\nSure.\n\nDonald Trump (19:30):\n\nGo ahead.\n\nNick Sortor (19:30):\n\nAbsolutely. President Trump, members of the Cabinet, really appreciate you guys bringing this together. And the fact that we are here today on such short notice shows how serious you guys are taking this issue of trans-terrorists, and frankly, the cities and police departments that are cooperating with Antifa, such as Portland. I mean, the Portland politicians are literally willing to sacrifice their own citizens just to appease these Antifa terrorists. It's sickening. I've seen it firsthand, obviously. When I went to jail that night, never expected it to happen, I thought that they were maybe removing me for my own safety.\n\n(20:14)It never crossed my mind that I was the one that was being arrested for a crime after I was just thrown into a hole. I heard from the Department of Homeland Security after I had gotten out of jail, and one of your… I won't say exactly who it was, but somebody very close to Secretary Noem over here said that they were legitimately worried for my safety in the Portland jail, but luckily the Portland jail was… I was the only one there, essentially, because they don't actually arrest people in Portland besides conservative journalists, I guess.\n\n(20:47)It was not a good night for me, let's just say that. It was not fun sitting in that jail, but I'm glad to see what has come of it. And I've been able to talk to a bunch of FBI agents, ATF agents, DHS agents that I didn't even know existed until I went there and went to that ICE facility. And the morale is at an all time high. It is so exciting to see these guys know now that they have the backing of the Secretary, the DOJ as well as the President of the United States, and they are there to do their job. They are going to fulfill this mission and deport these violent criminals. I did a ride along with Secretary Noem yesterday, President Trump, and there was a pedophile that had come into the country five times over the past seven years, seven years, and apparently under the Biden regime, that was just allowed to happen. That was fine. No problem.\n\n(21:48)It's concerning to me that you're seeing the Portland Police Department as well as the governor of Oregon and the mayor, of course, coming out and running defense for pedophiles that have entered the country illegally five times. It's crazy. I'm glad it's taking a front row seat in the media and they're being forced to talk about it in reality, because we are the ones that were on the ground, we are the ones that are actually reporting what's going on. And much of the legacy media has been either ignoring it or covering for Antifa for years now. So thank you guys so much for taking this seriously. And President Trump, you mentioned that flag. So remember, you put out a truth right after. I-\n\nDonald Trump (22:35):\n\nThat's right. I said…\n\nNick Sortor (22:37):\n\nTook this flag from that man that was burning it in the street.\n\nDonald Trump (22:40):\n\nDo you know who he is?\n\nNick Sortor (22:41):\n\nOh yeah, I know exactly who it is.\n\nDonald Trump (22:43):\n\nSo why don't you give it to Pam? Give it to the Attorney General and let's start prosecutions.\n\nNick Sortor (22:49):\n\nYeah. I actually have a second flag that he tried to burn as well. So I have two of them from the same guy.\n\nDonald Trump (22:53):\n\nSo what happened when that flag started burning? Everyone went crazy.\n\nPam Bondi (22:57):\n\nThat's right.\n\nDonald Trump (22:57):\n\nAnd that's when it started, when they started burning the flag. So thank you. If you could give the information, it would be great.\n\nNick Sortor (23:02):\n\nAbsolutely. I'll-\n\nDonald Trump (23:03):\n\nAnd at least that horrible night made you famous.\n\nPam Bondi (23:08):\n\nHe was already famous.\n\nNick Sortor (23:08):\n\nI got a text from the President of the United States, so I appreciate that.\n\nPam Bondi (23:11):\n\nAnd President Trump, after that happened to Nick, I called Harmeet Dhillon and we opened a pattern and practice investigation into the Portland Police very publicly as to how they let this happen.\n\nDonald Trump (23:22):\n\nThank you very much.\n\nNick Sortor (23:22):\n\nThank you, sir.\n\nDonald Trump (23:22):\n\nThank you.\n\nBrandi Cruse (23:23):\n\nMr. President, Brandi Kruse, you're going to hear us be very fired up today, and you can tell, and it's because some of us have been covering Antifa for 15 years and have never had anyone in a position of authority even acknowledge their existence. And I'll also tell you that I think that had you not done… The single most powerful thing you've done to deal with this scourge has been acknowledging that Antifa is a real thing. I genuinely believe there would be people at these tables who would be dead today and would've been killed in Portland had you not called them a terror organization and said, \"We're going to bring the full weight of the federal government to bear.\" I talked to Katie Daviscourt in Portland\n\nBrandi Cruse (24:00):\n\nAnd the other day, she'd been assaulted all summer and she said the same thing. They didn't seem quick to violence as soon as you made that designation. So, they're thinking in their heads, they're worried there's been two dozen or so arrested in Portland. They don't want to go to federal prison. There's this video of them, one of them who is in the face of an ICE agent and then he's in custody shaking. Once you take the mask off, they're nothing. And I was told by probably a dozen people not to tell you this, I'm going to tell too anyway, because it's relevant to what we're talking about. I'm living proof that you can recover from TDS. I had strong Trump derangement syndrome for probably eight years.\n\n(24:44)This is one of the reasons I recovered from it. And by the way, it's much better to not have TDS. I'm happier, I'm healthier, more successful. I even think I got a little more attractive after I got rid of my Trump derangement syndrome. Yes. I'm a reporter in Seattle and frankly, I could not care any less what any of you have to say about this meeting, could not care any less. We're not here for you. I'm not here to convince any of you that Antifa is a real thing because if you have not come to that conclusion by now, you are never going to come to that conclusion because you don't want to see it.\n\n(25:15)And you're going to go and you're going to say it's a bunch of right-wing conservative influencers who are here spinning a tale, I was one of you. I was a mainstream reporter in Seattle for 10 years. I was a TV reporter on the streets doing my job and I was still assaulted by Antifa. So, it's not about being conservative, it's about people who go there and show what they're doing. And when I saw after all those years that the media wouldn't be honest about what was happening, that democratic politicians wouldn't be honest about what was happening, I thought, \"Well, gosh, if they're not being honest about that, maybe they're not being honest about President Trump either.\"\n\n(25:51)And it opened my mind to just looking at things for what they were. And now I find you quite funny actually. No, I said I'm much happier about it. But for me, again, I could not care any less the stories that they go to print. This is what I care about. We have three and a half years. Nothing is guaranteed, although I think if Democrats keep it up, we'll probably have Republican presidents for the next three decades, but nothing is guaranteed. And so, what I want to see over the next three and a half years is a full court press to dismantle Antifa once and for all in a meaningful way. I know Andy, we talked before this about some ideas. I don't care what the media says, I don't care what Democrats say.\n\n(26:29)They will never wake up to this fact. So, we want the federal government to take as many of these cases as possible, look at the interstate travel between Portland and Seattle when it comes to these people who are committing violent acts. And hopefully in three and a half years, they will be a shell of their former selves.\n\nDonald Trump (26:46):\n\nWell, I'm very close to that. And it's Antifa and many others unfortunately.\n\nBrandi Cruse (26:50):\n\nYes.\n\nDonald Trump (26:50):\n\nThere are many others, bad ones. Most have been named terrorist organizations. There are a couple that we're going to, but I think we've got it pretty well covered. But there are many others, but very specifically today's Antifa and it's really bad and we're going to get it cleaned up. Andy, do you have something? Thank you very much. I'm glad you no longer have TDS. I feel very good about that.\n\nBrandi Cruse (27:12):\n\nFully recovered.\n\nDonald Trump (27:13):\n\nThank you.\n\nAndy (27:14):\n\nThank you Mr. President and members of the Cabinet. I have a lot of gratitude and a little bit about my background. I'm born in Portland, Oregon from there and growing up, it's always been left-wing, very progressive and I liked it. It had cafes and artists and those who lived at Bohemian Lifestyle. And in 2016, I was a graduate student at Portland State studying political science. I was an editor at the student paper there, a very progressive paper. And I was assigned to cover the election night demonstrations. Well, the elections night protests turned to riots, three days of violent rioting in Portland. And it was the first time that I saw groups dressed in black with their faces covered. This was four years before COVID.\n\n(28:01)Some of them were waving the black flag of anarchism some the red flag of Marxism. And within seconds, they would ravage one street to another, to another to another. And the next day I would read the legacy media, which I still read at that time and looked forward to. And I looked up to those journalists and I was really shocked to see that the narrative was that these, in my view, anti-democratic political violence was legitimate acts of protest because they were concerned about racism or all these other lies. And so, for the next four years, I just continued going out with my video camera. I thought, look, people can ignore what I write because of spin, but videos can quite speak for themselves.\n\n(28:54)And in 2019, it led to me nearly losing my life. I was covering another Antifa protest and riot at that point, had been routine in Portland. And then I was ambushed in a mob beating and I had never been in a fight. I didn't even realize that I was being assaulted until seconds in. And the punches came from everywhere on my head and my face, and I was bleeding out of my eyes and ears. And then they threw all the drinks in my eyes to humiliate me further and to laugh at me. And I was rushed to the hospital in an ambulance and CT scan, and I had subarachnoid hemorrhage, which is bleeding in the brain and nearly died.\n\n(29:41)And after surviving that, the reporting that I saw in liberal media, it seemed to suggest that I had deserved it because they branded me far right. And some even went so far as to suggested I maybe faked my injuries. A BuzzFeed reporter asked for my medical records, which I did provide. But this felt so it's like because I didn't die in that attack, there was another round of people who wanted to finish me off, but I continued. And then 2020, Portland was really the epicenter of the longest political violence. Those months of riots, I was on the ground, undercover and there was an assassination there.\n\n(30:25)There was a supporter of Donald Trump named Aaron Danielson, who was shot dead by a self- described Antifa member who then fled out of state and died in a shootout with US marshals. In 2021, I returned undercover naively thinking that enough time had passed and was chased through the streets of downtown and beaten, nearly choked out. The person who was trying to choke me out held me so tightly that I had the vessels in my eyes burst. So, one of the symptoms where my eyes were completely red after that and I was hospitalized. So, thank you so much for acknowledging Antifa and for directing your administration.\n\n(31:10)To treat them as domestic terrorists is going to be really challenging because how they organize is that they are decentralized, autonomous, and they operate on deception. And we're still to this day, told that they don't exist, that it's a figment of our imagination. I think the DOJ could look at federal conspiracy charges. The State of California and San Diego County last year broke up an Antifa cell in San Diego, and I think maybe perhaps the State Department should designate Antifa its international arm as a foreign terrorist organization FTO. So, thank you so much for this invitation, Mr. president.\n\nDonald Trump (31:49):\n\nThank you. Thank you very much, Andy. Great. That's a rough time you had. So, the choke-out was almost the end, you felt?\n\nAndy (31:58):\n\nYeah, that was my only near- death experience in my life, and I'm quite shaken when I think about it now. It really feels unbelievable to me that on the streets of America that this type of violence against citizens could become so routine and accepted and cheered on by people. Although in the immediate aftermath of Mr. Kirk's assassination, we saw again that type of depravity play out on quite large swaths of the left. So, there's a deep sickness that's in this country right now, and it means me a lot to acknowledge it.\n\nDonald Trump (32:33):\n\nYeah, the amazing thing is you look at Portland and you see fires all over the place. You see fights and I mean just violence. It's just so crazy. And then you talk to the governor and she acts like everything is totally normal. There's nothing wrong. It's almost like are you waking up from a dream or something? You see it on your network, you see it all over the place, and it's so bad, it's so crazy. It's like the movies you see for the kids, I guess not only the kids, adults also where you have these bombed out cities and these bombed out people. It's like worse than that. I don't think they could make a movie as bad and then the governor will get up and say, \"I don't know why they're coming here. It's such a wonderful place.\"\n\n(33:16)And the amazing thing is the people want us to be there. The people, when they get the real people that live there, many of them have left, but the real people want us to be. The same thing in Chicago. So, they've had 60, 70 murders over a short period of time. Murders, people that got shot, they've had hundreds of people shot. And then a guy like Pritzker or this low IQ mayor gets up. I mean, he got up, he's got a 5% approval rating and the people are all against him. They want people to come. Beautiful black women are wearing a MAGA hat last night on television, beautiful people. And once they said, \"We don't care who comes, just stop the crime.\"\n\n(33:59)They don't care. Frankly, they don't care if it's National Guard and military, send in anybody you want, stop the crime. And they're afraid to go out. They can't even go out. And then a guy like Pritzker, think of that 50, 60, 70 people over a short period are murdered, actually murdered, mostly gun violence, but knives, but gun violence, they're murdered. And hundreds of people shot. They had one weekend with had like 18 murdered and 71 shot, but they said, you know what their excuse is, yeah, but it was a long weekend. In other words, it was a long weekend, so that was okay. And then Pritzker gets up and he says, \"I don't know what they're talking about. We don't have crime here.\n\n(34:40)They're crazy. I think actually they're petrified. Their families live there, everything else. I actually think they're scared. Pritzker was a failure in his family. They throw him out of the family business. The guy's a loser. But you know what, actually, I believe they're scared. They're actually frightened for their lives. Jack, please say a few words.\n\nJack (35:04):\n\nMr. President, thank you so much for having us here today and holding this roundtable. Antifa is real. Antifa has been around in various iterations for almost a hundred years in some instances going back to the Weimar Republic in Germany, and it's now been just under one month since we saw a far leftist murder, Charlie Kirk. And we saw thousands upon thousands of people, other far leftists and people in positions of authority, people like nurses and pilots and doctors and HR departments celebrating the death and the murder of Charlie Kirk. This sickness that's out there is absolutely real and Mr. president, thank you for mentioning the fact that one of the bullet casings read, \"Hey, fascist, catch on it.\"\n\n(35:56)One of the other bullet casings right next to that had Bella Ciao written on it. Now, Bella Ciao is a song that is known in Antifa circles as the international anthem of Antifa. And all of us around this room that have studied Antifa, were very familiar with these symbols. And Mr. President, I think the situation is getting worse. When you look at people like Luigi Mangione in his 20s, Thomas Matthew Crooks, of course, who took a shot at you, sir, the ICE shooter in Dallas, and now this Tyler Robinson. We're starting to see a pattern of more and more murderous violence. And this same violence is not just random, it is targeted assassinations which are getting worse.\n\n(36:44)And every single one of us in this room that goes out there, and obviously you as well, sir, and all the staff, we are now under that threat every single day and working there at Turning Point USA. And I've spent just about the last month out there in Phoenix with Erika, with the family, with the team. And I will tell you this, Mr. President, even though going through something like that, which is an absolute nightmare, and people say, \"What was it like to speak in front of all those people,\" it's horrible. Every second of it was horrible, but we're not going to quit.\n\n(37:19)And Turning Point USA is continuing the tour that Charlie was on. We had 6,000 people when we went back to Utah. We had 5,000 people last night in Montana if you can believe that. We are continuing to organize on campus. We are getting more and more people coming out in the face of this threat knowing what happened to Charlie. But Mr. president, we need to do something about this because I fear that the next one who could be killed could be sitting at this table right now and we're not going to stop. But they need to stop and they will not stop until they are stopped. Thank you.\n\nDonald Trump (37:56):\n\nThank you, Jack. I appreciate it very much. One thing I have to say is that Washington DC was almost as bad. I don't know what could be worse than Portland. You don't even have stores anymore. They don't even put glass up. They put plywood on their windows, but most of the retailers have left. But Washington DC was so bad, and Pam, I'd say it took 12 days to really make it pretty good and a month to make it great. And now people are going out to dinner, the restaurants are booming, they don't have enough seats. They're opening up new restaurants because many of them closed and people are walking down the street, totally safe. A reporter, I'm not sure if she's there, I can't see. Somebody reported, there she is.\n\n(38:35)She was violently assaulted. And I don't know, she tends to be somewhat liberal, but she wasn't liberal on this one. I appreciated your honesty, but that won't happen again. It won't happen again. You're lucky, you're alive, frankly, with what happened. I know exactly what took place. So, Washington DC, our capitol, we thought we'd start there appropriately and it's safe. And people are so happy, they're so happy. And now it's a couple of months. I went to dinner there, I felt totally safe. I gave a press conference right in the middle of the street, which I don't think Secret Service was thrilled about, but I'll tell you what, I wouldn't have wanted to do it six months ago. It's incredible what happened.\n\n(39:18)Now, we're in Memphis. As you know, we're having a great impact in Memphis. It's been only a week, but Kash, I hear it's been amazing what's happening there just very early. But you take a look at DC and you take a look at some of the other, we've had a big impact there. What we haven't said, because Pritzker said, \"Well, crime is going down in Chicago.\" Well, five months ago, Kash went to Chicago with a lot of FBI agents just to prepare it so that we went in with, I guess you could call a surge, call it whatever you want, but would be even more effective. And we're going to be doing that and very, very strongly doing that because Chicago is a very unsafe city. It's a great city.\n\n(39:57)The head of the Union Pacific Railroad said, \"Sir, please save Chicago. It's a great city. It can be saved.\" Other cities are gone. I mean, they're lost. They can get better, but they're just really, they've been so decimated. But I'm so proud of what they've done so quickly in DC and it's taking place quickly in Memphis, where we were asked to go by the mayor and by the governor, and it's really incredible what we can do and how fast we can do it. Let's go for two more. Would you like to go? And then Katie, you'll go, okay, please.\n\nSpeaker 1 (40:30):\n\nYep. Thank you Mr. president for having us here. And not to sound like a broken record, but it needs to be said that Antifa is real. It's real, it's a threat. I just saw him last weekend over in Portland while they're causing mayhem over there. And the reason why there's such a big problem is because we have Democrats and a lot of people in the mainstream media refusing to acknowledge that they even exist, right? So, how can we as a country begin to address it if we have large swaths of these people who are supposedly decision-makers and people who are supposed to inform? They don't want to say that it exists because the common argument is like, \"Well, they're not a real organization because there's no national leadership.\n\n(41:07)They don't have a national headquarters. So, how can law enforcement go after a group that doesn't exist like that?\" Well, law enforcement goes after criminal groups that organize to rob banks or do smash and grabs. They don't have a registered LLC. They don't have official membership cards. They don't have a business address, but law enforcement still goes after them because they're working as a group. These people don't just show up randomly at the same time to do the same thing, dressed in a very similar fashion, espousing the same ideology. And they say, \"Well, it's an ideology. It's like, well, yes, it's an ideology because there's people alive present that believe in it and they're acting on it.\n\n(41:44)And so, I've been very well aware of what Antifa has been doing. I was very busy during the riots in 2020. That was probably my most exposure to them prior to this year. I've been at the ICE facility at Broadview. I'm originally from the Chicagoland area, unfortunately. But that's where I grew up around. Like I said, I was in Portland. I was covering the riots in Los Angeles as well. And probably one of the most disturbing parts about that is in addition to Antifa being present, they were tagging the streets with CJNG, which is Cartel Jalisco Nueva Generación, which is a cartel.\n\n(42:24)So, you have these people who are working basically in concert with other terrorist groups to say that we are here, we're present, and we're going to attack federal agents and people who are going to expose what we do. And so, to be clear, sustained political violence that we're seeing in this country is not both sides issue. I was at Charlie Kirk's memorial in Glendale recently, conservative gathering, totally peaceful. It was the most peaceful gathering that I've been at. Every other time that I've been covering violence in the streets, just this year, it's always been from left-wing people, radical left-wing people. And it's not even just Antifa anymore.\n\n(43:07)The defensive shooting that happened in the Chicago area that wasn't someone dressed in black block, that was just somebody that had taken upon themselves to go out and try to interfere and ram federal vehicles. So, people are becoming more and more radicalized. And it was to be expected, unfortunately. And the reason why we're in this position today is because after I was done covering the riots, I was at the border from the San Diego sector all the way down to the Rio Grande Valley sector, covering the border crisis month after month. And we all knew the solution to that. We all knew why it was happening. It's because, well, it's racist to have a border. It's like, well, actually it's not, but okay.\n\n(43:44)And so, it required you to come back into office and to fix the problem, but it's no longer just a border issue. It's a nationwide issue. And that's one of the reasons why you got elected back into office because thankfully the American people said, \"We're not going to deal with it anymore.\" But unfortunately, there's a lot of people, as we've seen, who are willing to take to the streets to do violence. And that's a scary thing because typically when I was in 2020, I was covering Minneapolis, Los Angeles, Portland, Seattle, I was over in Chaz, and that was to be expected. But now, because the issue of illegal immigration is so widespread, riots can happen anywhere, attacks can happen anywhere.\n\n(44:22)So, that's why it was weird going back to my home state to cover this violence. I mean, just after the Dallas shooting, they were chanting outside Broadview, \"Shoot ICE, shoot those efforts, shoot those efforts.\" So, I'll just leave that. Thank you so much again for having this. This is very dangerous. We don't work for companies that have billions of dollars. We're running and gunning often on our own. We became friends. A lot of us are friends because we would see each other all the time. And we became friends because we wanted to have someone watch our back while we're out there. Because like I said, we're just out there, but we'll continue to do it because it's an important topic, it's an important issue.\n\n(45:07)The American people deserve to know what's happening in these chaotic situations, and we're more than happy to do it. So, thank you, sir.\n\nDonald Trump (45:12):\n\nGreat job. Thank you very much. Katie, please.\n\nKatie (45:17):\n\nHi, Mr. President. It is an honor being here today and I first wanted to start by thanking you guys for designating Antifa. A terrorist group is exactly what this group is. It's a long time coming. I'm an investigative journalist from Seattle. I work for the Post-Millennial alongside Andy Ngo and Jack Posobiec. I have been infiltrating Antifa cells in Seattle and Portland for the past decade. I know their inner workings and Antifa uses extreme political violence to crush the civil rights of their political enemies and believes that violence is justified by any means necessary. But today, I want to focus on what is happening in Portland at the ICE facility.\n\n(45:58)I've been covering this for the past four months, and this is a call-out to corporate media who has completely ignored this story, or has falsely reported on it. This is nothing short other than a sustained attack on the United States, which is being supported by Democratic-elected officials. The Portland Police Bureau has completely abandoned several blocks outside the ICE facility, giving away their jurisdiction to a terrorist group who has spent the past four months harassing, assaulting and intimidating anyone they perceive to be against their cause.\n\n(46:33)Not only have federal agents been, agents been relentlessly assaulted for more than 100 consecutive days, black-clad anarchist militants concealing their identities behind black facial coverings have been assaulting reporters just for trying to cover their crimes. Today, I'm sitting here with a black eye and a concussion after being violently hit in the face with a metal pole while reporting outside the ICE facility. Just this past week after the attack, I immediately went to three Portland police officers who refused to detain the suspect. I took the time to chase down the suspect in the streets, had her held for 35 minutes. I was waiting for Portland Police to come and they never came then.\n\n(47:19)That's what opened my eyes to what this group is actually doing. I watched 20 Antifa militants help my assault suspect escape into an Antifa safe house that is one block away from the ICE facility. And this safe house is where Antifa-affiliated protesters are conducting parliamentary operations. It's where they're resting, they're showering, they're eating to continue this occupation. I have staked out this safe house and have observed shift changes. This group is highly organized. It is being funded through mutual aid groups, and they have no plans of stopping. Residents living across the ICE facility\n\nKatie (48:00):\n\n… have been held hostage by Antifa. They're begging for federal intervention. The city refuses to help, and they want you, President Trump, to come in and restore law and order. I want to stress the importance of taking this situation seriously because when I first started reporting on this occupation, I went undercover in Black Bloc. I talked to these Antifa militants. I lasted for about a month. They believe that ICE agents are the Nazi Gestapo who need to be killed, they told me that directly. And I think that if this situation is not taken as seriously as it is, it's just a matter of time before someone gets killed. And thank you for having me.\n\nDonald Trump (48:38):\n\nThank you, Katie. That's pretty incredible. The only question nobody can answer is why? Why are they doing this? They're like insurrectionists. They're terrible people, but you really wonder why. Why are they doing it? What are they gaining? Other than they're obviously paid. They're paid a lot of money. Go ahead, please.\n\nSpeaker 2 (48:56):\n\nMr. President, if I can answer that question, the reason why they're doing it is because the same media that's sitting in this room with us has declared all of us at this table, Nazis and fascists, and they've been doing this for years. This is why Antifa feels emboldened to attack us.\n\n(49:11)Now, almost every single person at this table has been threatened with a steel bat. We've been assaulted, we've been harassed, we've been threatened. And that is, in huge part, due to the media. So, my message right now is for you guys because back in 2020, by the way, I was censored for my reporting on Antifa here in Washington DC. You were talking about how safe it is now, Mr. President. It wasn't so safe back then. Back in 2020, I watched as a father was being mobbed and surrounded by Antifa members as his terrified crying children looked on the police here did nothing. I watched as a woman had her hair violently ripped out of her skull simply for waving an American flag on the streets of Washington DC.\n\n(49:53)And by the way, if you guys try to go and find any of this footage, you won't find any of it because Twitter deleted all of it because our president shared my reporting and they deleted my entire account immediately after. So, now, if you want to know what happened in 2020, all you're going to see is the media headlines that said that, \"It was fiery, but mostly peaceful.\" Thanks for that one, CNN.\n\n(50:13)The reality is that it was an extremely violent period of time. And for the last 10 years, Antifa has been wrecking havoc on law-abiding and innocent American citizens, and it needs to end. Now, I'm with Turning Point USA. It's an honor to be here. Mr. President. Thank you guys so much, everybody in the administration, for giving us a seat at the table. Because the media has not only been demonizing us for so long, but immediately after the brutal assassination of our founder, Charlie Kirk, our Turning Point USA chapters have seen an uptick in violence across the nation, as Antifa chapters that are embedded in our universities go and target them.\n\n(50:52)It's been extremely difficult to report on the ground. And for a long time, I was afraid to go to Portland because I knew that the only people who would have my back, like Julio said, were one of my friends on the ground because there was no police force there. I was terrified to go because I knew if I got shot or stabbed, and I have been assaulted, I've been mobbed and robbed in Austin, Texas by Antifa, that nobody would come to help me.\n\n(51:13)So, my plea to the entire administration, especially to the DOJ, is every single radical left-winger who is in front of the ICE facility in Chicago, in New York, in Portland, please make sure that you use the full force of the law to come after each and every single one of them because it is us being soft on left-wing violence that has fomented all of the terror that we have seen in this country. And it is the left-wing getting away time and time again with assaulting law-abiding American citizens that has led us to this place. So, truly, to the Americans that I speak to on the ground, they feel completely abandoned by their state and local government. So, please step in. We have Americans begging for the National Guard.\n\n(51:54)And to the media over here, please report on the truth. Please do your jobs. I'm an American citizen. Everybody at this table simply views ourselves as American citizens who have an iPhone and the will to actually tell the truth. So, please take your job seriously and tell the truth to the American people. And thank you for letting me be here on behalf of Charlie to continue his legacy of cleaning up the country. Thank you, Mr. President.\n\nDonald Trump (52:17):\n\nThank you very much. Appreciate it. Wow, you feel very strongly I can see.\n\nSpeaker 2 (52:21):\n\nI'm mad. I got beat up so many times, Mr. President. My friends have gotten beaten up. And I want to cry right now from happiness because we have been completely ignored for so long. For almost 10 years, we've been getting assaulted on the streets. I have watched children cry as their parents have been attacked on the streets. That should not be happening at our nation's capitol. So, please, again, the DOJ, please utilize the full force and go after each and every single one of these people.\n\nDonald Trump (52:45):\n\nFantastic. Thank you very much. Great job. Impassioned. That's important because you should feel like that. Please, go ahead.\n\nJack (52:54):\n\nMr. President, thank you for having us here-\n\nDonald Trump (52:56):\n\nThank you.\n\nJack (52:56):\n\n… and bringing together this panel of brave, brave journalists, everybody on this side of the room. And no one can speak to the violence better than these people here. So, I think we know that this is not just a story about violence and chaos, as you alluded to Mr. President, this is a money story. And at the Government Accountability Institute, my colleague and I, Peter Schweitzer and our team, we followed the money and we followed it to the top of what we call the protest industrial complex, Riot Inc. and we found a network of NGOs. It's not just the Soros Network, the Open Society Network, it's other funding networks, the Arabella Funding Network, the Tides Funding Network, Neville Roy Singham and his network, foreign cash. And it's also big left-wing funders, some of them are not citizens of this country. Mr. [inaudible 00:53:50] of Switzerland.\n\n(53:51)They're pouring money into this entire ecosystem. And so, I want to share three money facts with you about what we call Riot Inc. Number one, like any corporation, Riot Inc. has many divisions. It doesn't just have the Antifa Boots on the ground division, it has PR divisions, it has marketing divisions. It has a very well-funded legal division to get these boots on the ground back on the streets as quickly as possible, but it does have those investors that I mentioned.\n\n(54:17)Number two, we have identified dozens of radical organizations, not just the decentralized Antifa organizations, but dozens of radical organizations that have received more than $100 million from the Riot. Inc. investors. These would be the lawyer groups, these would be the groups that advocate for calling good, honest Americans, fascists, et cetera.\n\n(54:40)And then, three, I think the most shocking thing is that we have found that more than $100 million in US funding has flowed into these funding networks, including at least $4 million to these very groups themselves. Not just Antifa types, but there was an event in Atlanta called Stop Cop City. Over 60 rioters were charged with domestic terrorism. These groups received money for that from, both the billionaire class as well as taxpayer money.\n\n(55:10)So, one other thing, this money helps fund the decentralized crowdfunding platforms. These are ways that Antifa, the John Brown Gun Club of Elm Fork, which had links to that attack on the ICE facility, the Socialist Rifle Association. And just because they don't have LLCs or EIN numbers doesn't mean they can't get paid. Some of these crowdfunding platforms are funded by this network that we call Riot Inc.\n\n(55:38)So, again, I want to thank you for your leadership, for the whole cabinet's leadership on this. We're going to keep following the money and appreciate everything you're doing, sir.\n\nDonald Trump (55:48):\n\nDo you know the name of any of the funders? Do you know the names? Because if you do, I'd like you to give them to Kash or Pam.\n\nJack (55:54):\n\nAbsolutely.\n\nDonald Trump (55:55):\n\nOr Christie.\n\nJack (55:56):\n\nYeah, we'll do that.\n\nDonald Trump (55:57):\n\nAs soon as you can. That's all of you, because you probably know the names. After a certain period of time, you tend to find out. But these are people that do not have good intention for the country, and that's treasonous, probably. So, very important. If you could do that, it would be great. Nobody would know better than you. You'll figure it out. Thank you. Please, go ahead.\n\nSpeaker 3 (56:21):\n\nYeah, my name's Nick Shirley. I'm 23 years old. I'm a 100% independent YouTube journalist. And over the past year or so, I've been able to go to 15 countries. I've hung out with people in the gangs of Brazil in favelas, in the prisons of CECOT, but yet the most dangerous places I have been here in the United States, unfortunately. And I've had the opportunity to show people about the protest Antifa here in the United States, and there's nothing organic about what they are doing here in the United States. I've watched people be bussed in from states. I've watched the same lady at a protest in Atlanta be bussed the protest in DC and then in New York City. There's nothing that is honest about what they're doing, and they have signs. I've seen the same signs here in DC and in London as well. It's a big corporation that they're running.\n\n(57:12)And people may wonder, \"What's the threat to us as Americans if we go?\" Well, you'll be labeled as a fascist, you'll be labeled as a Nazi, and they'll wish death upon you because they wish death upon me. And just last week in Portland, Oregon, I watched a lady get trapped in her car, surrounded by Antifa, and her sister messaged me after seeing the video. She said, \" The only reason I think my sister was safe is because you were there recording.\" I also was chased out by a member of Antifa who said he would smoke me. And next thing he knew, a DHS sniper had lasers on his chest. If he was not there, who knows what would've happened that day.\n\n(57:48)These people are very dangerous and people wonder how they're able to do it. The reason is because these cities are not enforcing the law. And why should these people be worried if the law is not being enforced? And we are not far right, nor are we far wrong, we're just right. And the truth about what's happening here in America with these groups is very dangerous. And I thank you, Mr. President, and your administration as well for acknowledging that.\n\nDonald Trump (58:14):\n\nThank you very much. It's too bad you have to go through it, but thank you very much.\n\nSpeaker 3 (58:18):\n\nI know. It's so crazy, right, Mr. President?\n\nDonald Trump (58:19):\n\nWell, you're going to get to the bottom of it, so it's a very important thing you're doing. Thank you very much. Please, Cam.\n\nSpeaker 4 (58:25):\n\nYeah, I've just got something very short. I'm attacked every time I do my job. When I leave my house to go to work, I'm violently assaulted. I've had guns pulled on me. I've been bear sprayed. I've been beaten down. I've been almost killed. So, my question for all of you is how would you feel if every time you showed up to work, masked militants tried to kill you? Because that's how we feel. That's our lived reality. And you guys go and tell us that we're liars, the riots aren't that bad, right? I've never seen any of you guys on the ground. In fact, I've never seen anybody representing the companies you work for on the ground. You guys come to us for interviews that never get published. Stop saying we're lying, we're not. We risk our lives every day to do the job that you guys are too afraid to do.\n\nDonald Trump (59:10):\n\nWhat network would you say is the worst that I could ask?\n\nSpeaker 4 (59:14):\n\nOh man, that's a real tight spot-\n\nDonald Trump (59:16):\n\nHonestly. It's a simple question and it's-\n\nSpeaker 4 (59:18):\n\nThere's a lot of people in this pool, and I would say, I'm not talking about Fox, I'm not talking about Newsmax or any outlet that resembles them. So, I'll let you guys put the pieces together on who I'm exactly talking about.\n\nDonald Trump (59:28):\n\nWho would you say? Which network is-\n\nSpeaker 4 (59:29):\n\nMSNBC, for sure.\n\nDonald Trump (59:31):\n\nOh, they're terrible. I agree.\n\nSpeaker 4 (59:32):\n\nCNN close. Yeah.\n\nDonald Trump (59:34):\n\nYeah, I'd rate it that way. MSNBC, Brian Roberts. That he allows that to happen is a disgrace.\n\nSpeaker 4 (59:43):\n\nAbsolutely.\n\nDonald Trump (59:43):\n\nAnd CNN is second.\n\nSpeaker 4 (59:44):\n\nYeah.\n\nDonald Trump (59:45):\n\nI would say CNN is not quite as bad as MS.\n\nSpeaker 4 (59:48):\n\nMSNBC's not really a news site anymore.\n\nDonald Trump (59:50):\n\nOh, MSNBC is sick. They're sick.\n\nSpeaker 1 (59:53):\n\nWell, sir, it's also just the stories that they publish about the ICE enforcement operations that are so heavily slanted that it's no longer, as I was saying, no longer just Antifa, but Americans that are becoming radicalized. So, they've been very irresponsible with how they've been reporting on-\n\nDonald Trump (01:00:07):\n\nWho is that?\n\nSpeaker 1 (01:00:08):\n\nMSNBC, for example, they-\n\nDonald Trump (01:00:09):\n\nWould you rate them the worst?\n\nSpeaker 1 (01:00:11):\n\nProbably. They ran a story-\n\nDonald Trump (01:00:12):\n\nWho would you rate as second?\n\nSpeaker 1 (01:00:13):\n\nWell, they ran a story about an operation in Southern California about how a father of three Marines was arrested, and they made it seem like they just did it because he's brown, but there's video of that same man charging at the agents with a weed whacker. Now, I've worked with weed whackers back in the day, and you don't want to be in the receiving end of one of those, so that's why he was arrested. But the story was presented as if it's a brown guy just simply being arrested. And I've been around ICE agents and I'm a citizen, so I feel fine. But that's why. It's not just Antifa. It's not happening in a vacuum. It's multiple things.\n\nDonald Trump (01:00:47):\n\nNo, I think they work in conjunction with some of the media. I think ABC is very bad. I think NBC is very bad and CBS has a new owner. So, we have hope for CBS. CBS has a great new owner, my opinion. But I will tell you, ABC is terrible. NBC is terrible. NBC is MSNBC 2. They changed it. They moved it over legally, so they couldn't be tainted by the words MSNBC, but they are absolutely terrible. There are a lot of them. What about independents?\n\nSpeaker 1 (01:01:21):\n\nIndependents?\n\nDonald Trump (01:01:21):\n\nIndependent networks?\n\nSpeaker 1 (01:01:23):\n\nThey're a little bit better, but I would say that we're an example of how you don't need to be part of a super large company to be able to do just basic journalism. All you got to do is sit and record and you'll let the story play out, and that's why they hate us. That's why Antifa targets us.\n\nDonald Trump (01:01:37):\n\nWell, I watched a level of dishonesty that's incredible, where answers are changed. Just before the election, an answer was changed by Kamala. She gave a horrible death-defying, election-defying answer, and they took the answer out and they replaced it with another answer that she gave five minutes later having to do with a different subject, but at least it wasn't election- defying. No, the level of dishonesty with the media is incredible, whether it's on Antifa or many of the other groups. You're talking about Antifa, and I know that's close to your heart because that's the one that's most affecting you, but there are others that are as bad or almost as bad as Antifa having to do with different people, different sections of the world, but it's terrible. We're not going to let it go on in this country. We're not going to let it go on. And a big problem is not all of them, but some of the networks out there. And you do wonder why, you really do.\n\n(01:02:33)Okay, please. Go ahead. Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 5 (01:02:37):\n\nMr. President, thank you, again.\n\nDonald Trump (01:02:39):\n\nThank you.\n\nSpeaker 5 (01:02:39):\n\nThank my name's Jonathan Cho. I'm an investigative reporter for Frontline's Turning Point USA. I'm also a senior fellow at Discovery Institute in Seattle. And I cover far left extremism well, as the homeless drug crisis in America. And I find it oftentimes those worlds intersect. And hot off the press is what I wanted to bring to your attention today is a report from a Capital Research Center here in DC, in conjunction with Discovery Institute. They just put out this study right now. And what it shows is that Antifa is heavily embedded in the homeless and housing nonprofit sector. In many cases, the homeless industrial complex is running cover for Antifa. Antifa is benefiting from American tax dollars, and they're essentially being used as the muscle.\n\n(01:03:31)Let me give you an example. There's a group called Stop the Sweeps in many US cities right now. They get in front of encampment sweeps. What they're doing quietly is they're bringing in Antifa militants to manufacture a crisis to make the police look bad. Another group right now that is behind Antifa and working with Antifa very closely, based on the research that we have right now that we're going to give to you and your team, are the Democratic Socialists of America, also known as DSA. Again, these far-left progressive groups tend to be aligning themselves with Antifa.\n\n(01:04:08)So, finally, in closing, what I wanted to thank you again, Mr. President, is that a few months ago, earlier this year, you put out an executive order on homelessness and the drug addiction crisis in America, and that's sent the entire homeless industrial complex on the run. You have absolutely moved the needle and changed the game. But what's also come out, again, is that there is a connection, a deeply-embedded connection with the homeless housing nonprofit game in America connected to Antifa and the far-left activists.\n\n(01:04:40)And finally, I just wanted to say that all of our resources at Turning Point USA and Discovery Institute are at your disposal. And we will continue again to carry on the legacy of Charlie Kirk. He would've wanted us to pursue and chase this story.\n\nDonald Trump (01:04:54):\n\nYep. Well, he was a good friend of mine, as you know, and he helped us get elected. Us, it really is us. It's even some of them, but not too many of them. Not enough of them. And did you notice when we mentioned CNN and MSDNC? The cameras went off, two of the cameras immediately went off, but they're not going to cover it anyway. The problem we have is that this is a very important meeting, but you'll see very little press about it. These are major statements being made by major people, including the people right here. And you're not going to see too much about it. They don't like to cover this kind of thing. It's very dishonest what's going on there. I think the press is a big factor. Please, go ahead. Thank you, James.\n\nSpeaker 6 (01:05:33):\n\nMr. President, thank you so much for having us all here to bring attention to this matter. You did mention MSDNC, CNN, a handful of those other outlets that have been lying about, I mean, various things, but especially what the brave men and women over at ICE have been doing. I was talking to Antifa members in Portland the other day, and a lot of these people genuinely believe, they buy these lies, and they genuinely believe that they're fighting against literal Nazis and not brave men and women that are putting their lives on the line to basically enforce basic immigration law, that everyone seemed to agree with up until maybe a few years ago, a handful of years ago.\n\n(01:06:11)So, once again, thank you so much for having me. My name's James Klug. While my primary job is traveling around the country, having conversations with Americans about various political topics and issues, I have had a lot of run-ins with Antifa over the last five years. And I do think that Antifa is a primary reason why many conservatives are afraid to go out and protest and make their voices heard, and maybe bring friends and family to a demonstration and exercise their First Amendment right, because they're literally deathly afraid, and I talk to these people all the time. They're afraid of militants showing up in Black Bloc and hurting them and their families.\n\n(01:06:50)And I've personally witnessed Antifa assaulting hundreds of police officers. I've witnessed them firebombing police departments and federal property. I've witnessed them making death threats against federal agents, police officers, journalists. I think I've witnessed every single person here, maybe, maybe not personally, but I've seen them get hunted down and attacked. And so, this is a group that is responsible for a good percentage, if not a majority of the violent riots in 2021 and 2020, when Democrat mayors had a a hands-off approach with these left-wing militants. Just as a quick reminder for everybody, we're talking about dozens of murders that happened in those riots. We're talking about billions of dollars of damage to property and communities all over the country. We're talking about thousands of officer injuries. So, this isn't just like some little thing that they're, \"Oh, they punch a journalist here and there.\" No, they're responsible for a lot of damage and a lot of people that have, unfortunately, died and basically suppressing people's voices. And so, what I did want to talk about is almost every single person in the room here, to get this footage you have to go undercover because you are at risk of being beaten or worse. You have to go undercover. You have to film low-key to capture them committing crimes. This is stuff that the mainstream media was not doing and has not been doing. They'll show when Antifa is, maybe, it's a little bit more peaceful and they'll show when it's more mellow, but they'll remove the cameras when things get violent and it's actually dangerous to be here.\n\n(01:08:30)And I have personally witnessed legacy media vans showing up at a riot 300 yards away, getting out of the vehicle filming for 30 seconds saying something like, \"Fiery, but mostly peaceful.\" Packing up. And to add insult to injury, you have Democrat politicians that are saying, \"It's just an idea. That's all this is.\" So, it's just an idea after all of this chaos, it's just an idea. Well, that idea has threatened to kill me and many of my friends that are here today.\n\n(01:08:57)So, Mr. President, thank you so much for bringing this to the forefront, and it's definitely making a big change. Really appreciate you.\n\nDonald Trump (01:09:05):\n\nOne question. So, there are numerous groups. I mean, Antifa's terrible, but you have other groups that probably are almost as bad or just as bad. Not one other group was mentioned, I'm sort of surprised at that. You just come into contact with Antifa? It seems to be that you mostly come into contact with Antifa? Please.\n\nBrandi Cruse (01:09:26):\n\nThere's a lot of overlap. And I would say that, for instance, Jonathan brought up the Democratic Socialists of America. They're basically the same thing. I mean, there's a lot of Democratic Socialists of America who are out there in Black Bloc hiding their faces. And so, I think we use… And I do understand, for the record, I do understand the challenge, as Andy pointed out, with Antifa as a graspable entity, I do. But at the end of the day, when you look at behavior, you prosecute behavior, right? We're not prosecuting ideas or ideology, you're prosecuting behavior. So, whether you can prove that this amorphous thing is Antifa or someone has a patch that says, \"Antifa,\" it doesn't matter. Did they assault someone? Did they assault a federal agent? Were they engaged in rioting? What is it? And so, they're always using that, \"Oh, well, they don't call themselves Antifa,\" even though some of them literally do. It's called Rose City Antifa. How long has it been around in Portland, Andy?\n\nSpeaker 7 (01:10:25):\n\nSince 2007.\n\nBrandi Cruse (01:10:26):\n\nThey call themselves Antifa. In Seattle, I was outside the federal building, and they were yelling, \"There's no police here. This is Antifa land.\" And then, the same time Democrats, like our governor, \"Oh, Antifa is an idea.\" But yeah, I think Antifa can overlap with a lot of other entities and organizations.\n\nDonald Trump (01:10:45):\n\nOkay. Very good. Thank you.\n\nNick Sortor (01:10:48):\n\nPresident Trump, I just wanted to add this real quick because you were asking which mainstream media outlet is the worst? What I think, it's any of them that decided to call Kilmar Abrego Garcia, \"Maryland dad.\" Because when I'm out there on the street talking to these people, they call him, \"Maryland dad.\" He's actually a human trafficking MS-13 gang member that's illegally in the country. But the amount of people on the street that I spoke with that thought that he was a US citizen that was being deported to Uganda is dangerous. These people genuinely believe, based on what comes out of the garbage standing over here, that you guys are deporting US citizens. So, that's what's causing problems.\n\nDonald Trump (01:11:29):\n\nSo, when you have a governor like Pritzker in Chicago, where you have Illinois, which is in a lot of trouble, Chicago's there. Potentially great city again. It's not great now, but it could be great again. That's why we have to get there soon, because eventually, you can't do that. What makes a man like that say that, \"Things are wonderful\"? Why doesn't he say, \"We love that President Trump is going to come and help us clean up Chicago and make it safe again,\" as opposed to fighting us and pretending\n\nDonald Trump (01:12:00):\n\nThat there weren't 50 murders and 200 shootings and all of that. Why is that? Go ahead, Nick.\n\nNick Sortor (01:12:06):\n\nTo spite you. To spite you. To spite the administration. That's simply what it's about at this point. Because if you go and talk to some of these citizens… I'll use Portland as an example again, because I've been there for so long now. You talk to the neighbors that live in the apartments next door to the ICE facility, there are veterans with PTSD that live there and they're hear all night long screaming, fireworks being lit off by these rioters, children crying because they can't sleep at night and they're scared of all the noise outside. And they can't leave. They got a lease, you can't just leave. These people aren't wealthy individuals.\n\n(01:12:47)And that's one of the major problems here. And these people are afraid to come out and speak out, and they're getting no help from their government at all. They've been begging for the noise ordinance to be enforced outside of their apartment complex for months now, and the city of Portland has ignored them every single time. The victims are, as I said, they're afraid, but the governments aren't doing anything because they want to spite the administration. It's all political.\n\nDonald Trump (01:13:14):\n\nAnd the politicians make you feel like you're foolish, like there's something wrong with, \"How could President Trump be saying that about Chicago?\" And yet the night before you see that 11 people were shot, five people died, and you have him talking about like it's a wonderful situation. They make you feel guilty. And a lot of people don't get over that. They just don't get over it. I think they convinced the people. Do wealthy people leave too or not? Places like Portland, are the wealthy people leaving? People that can leave, are they leaving?\n\nBrandi Cruse (01:13:49):\n\nI think that they are moving to the areas that have been gentrified. The Oregon governor when she was saying, \"We don't need Trump here,\" she's walking around. It's a very tight shot, if you notice that, and she said, \"Portland's just fine. Look at me.\" And they'll focus on the couple areas of Portland that are very nice.\n\nDonald Trump (01:14:04):\n\nWell, she was saying that, and there were explosions in the background.\n\nBrandi Cruse (01:14:06):\n\nYeah. There was a reason they cropped it in.\n\nDonald Trump (01:14:09):\n\nWe don't need… and there's explosions in the background.\n\nBrandi Cruse (01:14:11):\n\nSir, I-\n\nDonald Trump (01:14:11):\n\nAnybody have anything else to say over here?\n\nSpeaker 8 (01:14:13):\n\nYeah. Well, just the co-presenters that you felt… Sorry. Mind if I [inaudible 01:14:17].\n\nDonald Trump (01:14:19):\n\nAnd then we get, should we be taking questions or is it just a waste of time? Because they're going to ask questions, but… Well, there's Brian. He's good. But you know what? In a way, it's a waste of time because if you give a great answer, they don't put it on. If you give a horrendous answer, or even if you give a great answer, they make it sound like it's not a great answer. They're very dishonest. Go ahead, Nick.\n\nSpeaker 3 (01:14:40):\n\nYeah, and I think part of that dishonesty comes from what they see. For instance, I've never been asked to go on any other show besides Fox News. My clips go viral everywhere, but they've never even asked. CNN's never asked. MSNBC's never asked. And a lot of times when I go to hotels, I'll stay and I'll watch MSNBC.\n\nDonald Trump (01:14:55):\n\nFortunately, their ratings are terrible.\n\nSpeaker 3 (01:14:57):\n\nThey are terrible.\n\nDonald Trump (01:14:58):\n\nMSNBC is dying and CNN is dying like a dog. Poor CNN. It's so pathetic.\n\nSpeaker 3 (01:15:04):\n\nIt is very pathetic.\n\nDonald Trump (01:15:05):\n\nYou ever see their anchors in the evening? Nobody ever heard of them. Where do these people come? I could take anybody off the street in Washington DC that do a better job. It's amazing.\n\nSpeaker 3 (01:15:15):\n\nYeah, it's not hard to show what's going on these days. You literally have an iPhone and you can post it on X.\n\nDonald Trump (01:15:18):\n\nThey don't believe in the star system. It's just one of those things, right? Okay, Nick. You finished, Nick?\n\nSpeaker 3 (01:15:23):\n\nYeah. Thank you very much.\n\nDonald Trump (01:15:24):\n\nAre you finished, Nick? Good job.\n\nSpeaker 9 (01:15:24):\n\nCan I-\n\nDonald Trump (01:15:26):\n\nThank you very much. Well, you've been through hell, I tell you that. But you're really incredible. Patriots are incredible people. Go ahead, please, Brian. Brian, go ahead.\n\nSpeaker 10 (01:15:36):\n\nI'm so thankful for each and every one of you here right now, and I'm very grateful that my network, Real America's Voice, has partnered up with many of you, Jack [inaudible 01:15:44]. You have a show in network. Many of you, Savannah, have appeared on a network as well. So thank you for being here.\n\n(01:15:49)My question is this, in terms of following the money, I would just notify that the city of Austin is clear to vote tomorrow to basically waive $120,000 fee so that a no kings, basically an anti-Trump rally can occur in their city. They're bypassing the fees, rolling it to the taxpayers. So my question is to you, what can the people of Austin, Texas do right now to make sure that their tax dollars don't fund a no kings anti-Trump rally coming up?\n\nDonald Trump (01:16:22):\n\nWell, you just tell me. I would love to do something about that. Bring a lawsuit, do something. The best thing you can do is have honest elections because the elections are totally rigged in so many of these places. You take a look, the people, they're all loving you. They can't breathe, they love so much. Every one of them, you don't see one negative. Then all of a sudden you lose the election by 20 points. The elections are so rigged, and we proved that in 2020 more than any other time. But even the last election, there were areas that I won by much more. We won in a landslide, but I actually wanted more of a landslide than we thought. I said, \"You got to get out. Make it too big to rig.\" And fortunately, the people made it too big to rig. They tried. They tried. But the biggest thing you can do is have honest elections. If you don't have… And you need great media, you need great-\n\nReporters (01:17:12):\n\nMr. President-\n\nDonald Trump (01:17:12):\n\nYou need borders. You need borders. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. You need borders. You need honest media. You need honest elections, and you have a great country. And you need all three of them. Yeah, go ahead.\n\nSpeaker 10 (01:17:24):\n\nI was told that [inaudible 01:17:27] and Times to along these radical groups that you talked about inside here. So thank you for removing them.\n\nDonald Trump (01:17:31):\n\nI would like you to make a big deal, though, if they're waiving a fee. But I guarantee they wouldn't waive it if it was… It's not Trump. If it were a conservative rally, they wouldn't be waiving it. So maybe you can look into that, Pam. Todd-\n\nReporters (01:17:42):\n\nMr. President-\n\nDonald Trump (01:17:43):\n\n… that sounds like that sounds like one for Todd, Pam. Go ahead, Todd. Good luck. Thank you.\n\nReporters (01:17:55):\n\nMr. President-\n\n(01:17:55)Proof that [inaudible 01:17:55]\n\n(01:17:55)[inaudible 01:17:55] cease fire.\n\n(01:17:55)There's proof [inaudible 01:17:55] actually insisted on-\n\nDonald Trump (01:17:55):\n\nWho are you with? Who are you… What network?\n\nSpeaker 11 (01:17:57):\n\nI'm with Al Arabiya. It's an Arabic network based in Riyadh in Saudi Arabia, but I am the foreign puller today. Mr. President, you said that you might go to the Middle East on Sunday. Do you mean Egypt and Israel? And would you consider going to Gaza to see what things on the ground?\n\nDonald Trump (01:18:14):\n\nI would. Yeah, I would. I might do that. I may do that. We haven't decided exactly. I'll be going to Egypt most likely. That's where everybody is gathered right now, and we appreciate that very much. But I'll be making the rounds, as the expression goes. I probably will.\n\nSpeaker 11 (01:18:29):\n\nSee [inaudible 01:18:30]\n\nReporters (01:18:33):\n\nMr. President.\n\n(01:18:33)Mr. President.\n\n(01:18:33)Cease fire from you, President. Mr. President.\n\nDonald Trump (01:18:33):\n\nGo ahead.\n\nSpeaker 12 (01:18:33):\n\nMr. President.\n\nDonald Trump (01:18:34):\n\nGo ahead.\n\nSpeaker 12 (01:18:35):\n\nJust to clarify, you said you might go to Gaza. You're saying on-\n\nDonald Trump (01:18:38):\n\nWho you with?\n\nSpeaker 12 (01:18:39):\n\nI'm representing the TV pool, but I'm with NBC, sir.\n\nDonald Trump (01:18:43):\n\nThat's too bad.\n\nSpeaker 12 (01:18:44):\n\nOkay.\n\nDonald Trump (01:18:44):\n\nGo ahead.\n\nSpeaker 12 (01:18:45):\n\nWell, just to clarify, you said you might go to Gaza? And then the second question I had, earlier today you said the mayor of Chicago and the governor of Illinois should be jailed. Have you asked the Justice Department to look at possible charges and-\n\nDonald Trump (01:18:56):\n\nNo. I've seen the law. And when you have a group of people where the police call off the safety for ICE officials, I've understood that, and I've read it today in numerous journals that that's illegal. What they did is the… I guess it was ICE, Kristi, right? They were under threat-\n\nKristi Noem (01:19:17):\n\nYes, Mr. President.\n\nDonald Trump (01:19:17):\n\n… and the police were helping beautifully, and it was fine. And then all of a sudden a woman was on the line saying, \"Everybody, move back, move back. Get out. Get out.\" And they were given an order by the second person in the police department. And the governor knew about it. The mayor knew about it. I understand that's a criminal offense. Do you want to comment on that, Kristi?\n\nKristi Noem (01:19:41):\n\nYes, sir. We're seeing that kind of pattern happen with local law enforcement and state law enforcement, not just in Illinois, but also out in Oregon too. In fact, in Portland, I was there yesterday, but some of the ICE officers were telling me that as they drove by the rioters that were saying, \"Kill ICE agents. Molotov cocktails melt ICE,\" that the Portland police were cheering them on, and had their fists in the air cheering on the rioters that were threatening their lives.\n\n(01:20:06)So in Chicago, we had a 10-car caravan trail our ICE officials and pin them down, and those ICE officials to get out of their vehicles, a woman tried to ram them and run them over, and shots were fired to get them to safety. So it's happening on a regular basis and any elected official that allows this to happen and gives cover to those kinds of-\n\nDonald Trump (01:20:27):\n\nIt's criminal.\n\nKristi Noem (01:20:27):\n\n… individuals who are perpetuating murder should absolutely be prosecuted, in my opinion.\n\nReporters (01:20:31):\n\nMr. President [inaudible 01:20:33]\n\nDonald Trump (01:20:31):\n\nDaniel.\n\nSpeaker 13 (01:20:32):\n\nThank, Mr. President.\n\nSpeaker 14 (01:20:35):\n\nThank you, thank you, thank you.\n\nDonald Trump (01:20:37):\n\nAnd by the way, we have Marco Rubio. Marco, come on up here, please. He's going to bring a little stability to this group. Come on up. Does everybody know Marco Rubio? Is there anybody that does it? Some of the reporters don't, that's why they shouldn't be reporters.\n\nNick Sortor (01:20:51):\n\nWhich job is he here for today, sir?\n\nDonald Trump (01:20:53):\n\nCome on up here, Marco. Anything we should know about the Middle East?\n\nSpeaker 14 (01:20:57):\n\nThat's what we're hoping to talk to you about here, Mr. President, once they leave.\n\nDonald Trump (01:21:02):\n\nHe's doing a good job. He was born for this job. I can tell you. Daniel, please.\n\nReporters (01:21:06):\n\n[inaudible 01:21:08]\n\nSpeaker 13 (01:21:07):\n\nMr. President, thank you very much. I have two questions for you, if that's okay. Shane has talked a little bit about the money aspect of this. Do you believe if you go after where the money is coming from with Antifa, in regards to Antifa, do you believe that would be similar to cutting the head off the snake, so to speak? And I have a question after this.\n\nDonald Trump (01:21:22):\n\nIt would help. I don't know that it would be totally complete, but it would certainly… You'd knock out 75%, 80%, 85%. These people, a lot of don't believe it. When they… I watch them and I see. I can almost tell a pro by they're like professionals. That's all they do. And they get paid by somebody. I think it would knock out a lot of it, yeah. Not all of it, maybe, but a lot of it.\n\nSpeaker 13 (01:21:45):\n\nAnd then a follow-up to that is a lot of the people who we've listened to over the last hour, they've emphasized that Antifa, it's not necessarily this big organized thing. It's a bit ambiguous. It's de-organized, I think that's one of the words that Andy used. What is the challenges of going after a group that makes it intentionally difficult to go after and find? That could be for you, the Attorney General, anyone up there.\n\nDonald Trump (01:22:06):\n\nWell, they're smart people and they deceive. A lot of them are crooked people. A lot of them have been staying out of trouble their whole lives, and they've been bad from the day they were born, frankly. But these are sick people. Pam, go ahead, please.\n\nSpeaker 15 (01:22:19):\n\nWell, they're smart, but they're not smart enough. Oh, my microphone's broken. They're smart, but they're not smart enough. They have been covered by these liberal cities for so many years, and that's why we're all working with Treasury, with all these different departments to find the criminal conspiracy.\n\nDonald Trump (01:22:41):\n\nOkay.\n\nSpeaker 13 (01:22:43):\n\nThank you.\n\nDonald Trump (01:22:43):\n\nI'm just giving-\n\nReporters (01:22:43):\n\nMr. President [inaudible 01:22:47]\n\nDonald Trump (01:22:47):\n\nI was just given a note by the Secretary of State saying that we're very close to a deal in the Middle East and they're going to need me pretty quickly. So I will take a couple of more questions.\n\nReporters (01:22:57):\n\n[inaudible 01:22:58]\n\n(01:22:57)Mr. President, Mr. President [inaudible 01:23:04]\n\nDonald Trump (01:22:57):\n\nPlease.\n\nSpeaker 16 (01:23:06):\n\nThank you, sir. I also have two questions for you, if I may. Have you given any more thought to possibly suspending habeas corpus to not only deal with these insurrectionists across the nation, but also to continue rapidly deporting illegal aliens?\n\nDonald Trump (01:23:19):\n\nYeah, suspending who?\n\nSpeaker 16 (01:23:22):\n\nHabeas corpus.\n\nDonald Trump (01:23:24):\n\nOh. I don't know. I'd rather leave that to Kristi. What do you think?\n\nKristi Noem (01:23:28):\n\nNo. Sir, I haven't been a part of any discussions on that.\n\nReporters (01:23:30):\n\nMr. President [inaudible 01:23:34]\n\nDonald Trump (01:23:30):\n\nAll right. Go ahead.\n\nSpeaker 17 (01:23:30):\n\nAre you personally participating in the ceasefire negotiations-\n\nDonald Trump (01:23:40):\n\nThis is CNN speaking, by the way.\n\nSpeaker 17 (01:23:41):\n\nAre you personally participating-\n\nDonald Trump (01:23:42):\n\nYeah, this is one of the worst reporters that you'll ever… I don't even want to take her question. It's a waste of time.\n\nReporters (01:23:47):\n\nCall on me next, Mr. President.\n\nDonald Trump (01:23:48):\n\nGo ahead.\n\nSpeaker 18 (01:23:48):\n\nOn shutdown, Mr. President, how will you decide which workers get back pay and which workers do not?\n\nDonald Trump (01:23:54):\n\nWell, we're going to see. Most of them are going to get back pay, and we're going to try and make sure of that. But some of them are being hurt very badly by the Democrats and they therefore won't qualify.\n\nReporters (01:24:03):\n\n[inaudible 01:24:06]\n\nDonald Trump (01:24:06):\n\nGo ahead, please.\n\nSpeaker 19 (01:24:07):\n\nWhat will the administration do to foreign and people organizers and funders who are located overseas?\n\nDonald Trump (01:24:12):\n\nIt's… Go ahead. In the yellow, please.\n\nSpeaker 20 (01:24:14):\n\nThank you, Mr. President. So the Nobel Peace Prize will be announced on Friday. You've been nominated by many world-\n\nDonald Trump (01:24:22):\n\nBy many, many countries. That's right.\n\nSpeaker 20 (01:24:24):\n\nBy many countries as well as the hostage families. Do you think you will win?\n\nDonald Trump (01:24:29):\n\nI have no idea. I mean, look, I did settle. Marco would tell you we settled seven wars. We're close to settling an eighth, and I think we'll end up settling the Russia situation, which is horrible. 7,000 people died last week, by the way, in Russia, between Russia and Ukraine. I think we'll settle that. So I don't think anybody in history has settled that many. But perhaps they'll find a reason not to give it to me, you know? Perhaps they will.\n\nReporters (01:24:55):\n\nPresident Trump.\n\nSpeaker 17 (01:24:55):\n\nAre you participating in the-\n\nReporters (01:24:55):\n\nPresident Trump.\n\nSpeaker 17 (01:24:55):\n\n… ceasefire negotiations?\n\nSpeaker 21 (01:24:58):\n\nMr. President. Thank you so much, Mr. President.\n\nDonald Trump (01:25:00):\n\nThank you.\n\nSpeaker 21 (01:25:01):\n\nGoing to the shutdown quickly, what is your position on the extension of healthcare subsidies, which is what Democrats are asking for?\n\nDonald Trump (01:25:08):\n\nAll I want to do is very simple. I want to get the country open and then we're going to discuss that. And Obamacare is a horrible mess, and it has been from the beginning. We want to make it better, stronger, even if it costs more money, costs more money, we want to make it better. The Democrats want to make it worse. The Democrats want to prove healthcare for illegals coming into our country. Many of them coming in from prisons and mental institutions and drug dealers, they want to give them healthcare. We don't want that for our people because that's going to destroy the healthcare that we already have. We'd like to make Obamacare better for people. Less expensive and better healthcare. Yes, ma'am?\n\nReporters (01:25:47):\n\nPresident Trump-\n\nSpeaker 22 (01:25:49):\n\nMr. President, I'm wondering if you've been briefed on the organization and funding of Antifa. And if so, what have you learned?\n\nDonald Trump (01:25:56):\n\nI have been, and they have pretty good knowledge, but they're going to have a very good knowledge. And I really ask these very brave patriots that we're surrounded with today to let us know because I think you probably have some pretty good ideas. And even if you're not sure, let us know and we'll figure it out. Okay? If you could do that.\n\nReporters (01:26:11):\n\nPresident Trump. President Trump.\n\n(01:26:11)President Trump.\n\n(01:26:11)[inaudible 01:26:12]\n\nSpeaker 23 (01:26:12):\n\n[inaudible 01:26:12] Middle East, can you specify-\n\nDonald Trump (01:26:19):\n\nYou're from Italy?\n\nSpeaker 23 (01:26:20):\n\nNo, I'm from France. Can you specify how close we are to the deal? Would that be announced today, tomorrow? And do you want to see the hostages released before you travel to the region?\n\nDonald Trump (01:26:30):\n\nNo, I think I'll probably go maybe before the hostages are released or shortly thereafter. Pretty much shortly thereafter. Yeah, please.\n\nReporters (01:26:37):\n\nPresident Trump.\n\n(01:26:37)Mr. President.\n\n(01:26:37)[inaudible 01:26:39]\n\nSpeaker 17 (01:26:38):\n\n[inaudible 01:26:39] participating in the negotiations?\n\nDonald Trump (01:26:39):\n\nGo ahead. Who you with? Who you with?\n\nSpeaker 24 (01:26:42):\n\nThe Center Square. I had the honor of asking you originally if you would designate Antifa, a terror organization. And I stand here before you today and I'm echoing what Andy said over here. Are you going to work with your administration, as the Secretary of State's here, are you going to work with your administration to designate a foreign terror organization?\n\nDonald Trump (01:27:01):\n\nYou mean it a terror?\n\nSpeaker 24 (01:27:03):\n\nAntifa-\n\nDonald Trump (01:27:04):\n\nAntifa?\n\nSpeaker 24 (01:27:05):\n\n… a foreign terror organization.\n\nDonald Trump (01:27:06):\n\nWell, has that been done?\n\nSpeaker 24 (01:27:07):\n\nNo.\n\nDonald Trump (01:27:08):\n\nPretty close, right? Would you like to see it done?\n\nSpeaker 25 (01:27:10):\n\nYes, Mr. President.\n\nDonald Trump (01:27:11):\n\nDo you think it would help?\n\nSpeaker 25 (01:27:12):\n\nThey have foreign links-\n\nDonald Trump (01:27:13):\n\nI'd be glad to do it.\n\nSpeaker 25 (01:27:13):\n\n… all across Western Europe-\n\nDonald Trump (01:27:14):\n\nI think it's the kind of thing I'd like to do. If you'd like to?\n\nSpeaker 25 (01:27:16):\n\n… and Middle East.\n\nDonald Trump (01:27:16):\n\nDoes everybody agree? If you agree, I agree. Let's get it done, okay? Let's get it done, Marco. We'll take care of it.\n\nSpeaker 17 (01:27:22):\n\nMr. President-\n\nDonald Trump (01:27:23):\n\nThat's international, you mean? International.\n\nSpeaker 24 (01:27:25):\n\nYes. Yes [inaudible 01:27:26]\n\nSpeaker 17 (01:27:25):\n\nMr. President?\n\nDonald Trump (01:27:26):\n\nSounds good to me.\n\nSpeaker 24 (01:27:26):\n\nForeign terror organization.\n\nDonald Trump (01:27:26):\n\nSteve, are you okay with it?\n\nSpeaker 26 (01:27:31):\n\nYes, it's true, there are extensive foreign ties, and I think that would be a very valid step to take.\n\nDonald Trump (01:27:35):\n\nGood. I think so too.\n\nSpeaker 26 (01:27:36):\n\nYes.\n\nSpeaker 17 (01:27:36):\n\nPresident Trump.\n\nDonald Trump (01:27:36):\n\nGood. I think it's a-\n\nSpeaker 17 (01:27:36):\n\nPresident Trump.\n\nDonald Trump (01:27:38):\n\n… good point. Thank you.\n\nReporters (01:27:39):\n\n[inaudible 01:27:40]\n\nSpeaker 17 (01:27:39):\n\nPresident Trump, are you participating participating in this?\n\nSpeaker 27 (01:27:43):\n\nOn the shutdown? We are now about one week away from military service members missing their paychecks. Would you-\n\nDonald Trump (01:27:49):\n\nWe'll always take care of our military.\n\nSpeaker 27 (01:27:50):\n\nWould you encourage Congress to pass a standalone bill to pay our service members?\n\nDonald Trump (01:27:56):\n\nYeah, that probably will happen. We don't have to worry about it yet. That's a long time. You know what one week is for me? An eternity. One week for me is a long time. We'll take care of it. Our military is always going to be taken care of.\n\nSpeaker 17 (01:28:09):\n\nMr. President-\n\nDonald Trump (01:28:09):\n\nYeah, please.\n\nReporters (01:28:10):\n\nMr. President.\n\n(01:28:10)Mr. President.\n\nDonald Trump (01:28:11):\n\nBlue dress. Blue.\n\nSpeaker 28 (01:28:14):\n\nThank you, Mr. President. Rebeka with Blaze News. I'm curious to know, you're talking about the money funding these Antifa organizations and somebody brought up Roy Singham, I think it was you, who by the way, is married to one of the co-founders of Code Pink, this infamous left-wing organization. I'm curious to know the administration's-\n\nDonald Trump (01:28:30):\n\nWho is that? Who is that?\n\nSpeaker 28 (01:28:31):\n\nRoy Singham? He's married to-\n\nDonald Trump (01:28:33):\n\nNo. Did you say they're here?\n\nSpeaker 28 (01:28:34):\n\nNo, he's not. A journalist brought him up, but he is-\n\nDonald Trump (01:28:37):\n\nOh, I see. Okay.\n\nSpeaker 28 (01:28:37):\n\nYeah. James, thank you.\n\nDonald Trump (01:28:40):\n\nGood bring-up.\n\nSpeaker 28 (01:28:40):\n\n[inaudible 01:28:42]\n\nDonald Trump (01:28:42):\n\nGo ahead.\n\nSpeaker 28 (01:28:42):\n\nHe's somebody who's been reported on extensively, and I'd love to know what the administration is going to do to actually bring consequences to some of these names. You mentioned-\n\nDonald Trump (01:28:50):\n\nWell, I don't know the name, but I would like to ask Pam to take a look at it. A lot of the best information we find are through you and other people like you. So I'd like you to look at it, Pam.\n\nReporters (01:29:01):\n\nMr. President. Mr. President.\n\n(01:29:01)Mr. President [inaudible 01:29:02].\n\n(01:29:01)President Trump.\n\nDonald Trump (01:29:07):\n\nIn the back, please.\n\nSpeaker 29 (01:29:07):\n\nThank you so much. President Trump, it's been actually very compelling proof that Antifa did infiltrate on January 6th, dressed up like Trump supporters and incited violence. Is that something that you would want the new J-6th committee at Congress to look into?\n\nDonald Trump (01:29:21):\n\nWell, I've heard that they dress up like they're fresh out of MAGA-\n\nSpeaker 29 (01:29:24):\n\n[inaudible 01:29:24]\n\nDonald Trump (01:29:24):\n\n… but they have nothing to do with MAGA, and they make trouble and they try and blame it. And we know some of that and we will be acting on some of that. We've seen it. We've seen it. So I think you could say a little longer, but the problem is, although you have some very honest journalists in here, you also have some mostly largely dishonest journalists like MSDNC and CNN. I think they're very dishonest. Unbelievably. Like a waste of time even talking to him. But I have to go now to try and solve some problems in the Middle East, although I'm very well represented by our Secretary of State. He could probably do an even better job than me. But who knows? We don't want to take any chances. So we're going to go and do that.\n\n(01:30:07)If you'd like, Pam, would you like to stay for another five minutes, 10 minutes while we have all these great people? And I'll let Pam and Kristi take over and get some good points out.\n\n(01:30:17)I just want to thank the people around the table in particular. You've been amazing. You've been brave. You're real patriots. You're real patriots. And at some point we're going to have to look into, at least in certain cases, rewarding you with some very important medals and honors, okay, as we have done and will be doing what Charlie Kirk. Charlie is getting the Presidential Medal of Freedom, which is our highest award outside of the Congressional Medal of Honor.\n\n(01:30:40)And I think there's sort of even one's civilian and one's military, but unfortunately the civilian sometimes is military also because of what we have to go through on the streets of this country. I can only tell you this, we have a great nation. We have a nation that's right now the hottest in the entire world. We're the hottest nation in the world, despite all of the things we've been saying today. But that's going to make your job easier because nobody's doing better than we are financially. We've never done better.\n\n(01:31:11)We've had, I think 58 stock market increases since I've been top, meaning record increases. We have never seen anything like it, and we're going to keep it going. That makes it a little bit easier for what we're doing. I guess maybe it also makes some people crazy because they don't want to see us do well. But we're the hottest nation anywhere in the world, and we were a dead nation one year ago. I say it all the time, we were a dead nation, now we're the hottest nation in the world.\n\n(01:31:38)And that's said to by every leader. One of the reasons that we have every country already signed up or just about to sign, every country in the world on this whole mess we have going over with Hamas in the Middle East and all of the things you see is they respect our nation. A year ago, you wouldn't have been able to get it. You certainly couldn't have gotten it with Biden. He didn't know where the hell he was. But a year ago, you wouldn't have been able to have a situation like this.\n\n(01:32:04)So I just want to thank the people around this table, and certainly the officials around the table because they've been incredible, they've been brave. And I watched yesterday Pam, and I watched a little bit. I thought it was so good. I rounded up and I watched it late in the evening because I thought you were fantastic yesterday.\n\nSpeaker 15 (01:32:20):\n\nThank you.\n\nDonald Trump (01:32:20):\n\nYou really… Look, you had some wonderful senators, some great politicians asking you very fair questions, and you had some real, real slime balls, but I thought you were amazing. So thank you very much.\n\nSpeaker 15 (01:32:32):\n\nThank you, President.\n\nDonald Trump (01:32:32):\n\nAnd, Kristi, thanks for the great job. Kash, thanks for the great job. Always my man back down there. He's the silent type, but he's a hell of a lawyer. Thank you all. We're going to get peace in the Middle East. That's what we want to do. Thank you very much everybody.\n\nReporters (01:32:45):\n\nThank you, Mr. President.\n\n(01:32:46)Thank you. [inaudible 01:32:49]",

    "transcript": "President Trump (00:09):\n\nWell, thank you very much everybody. It's an honor to have the Prime Minister of Canada, Mark Carney, who I have made very popular. He's an extremely popular prime minister and I'm very honored to do it because I like him. Right from the beginning I've liked him and we've had a good relationship. We have some natural conflict, but we will probably work that out. But we've had a very strong relationship. Your hosting of the various countries that showed up, that was a beautiful job you did and I appreciate it very much.\n\n(00:41)We're going to be talking about trade, we're going to be talking about a lot of different things. We'll certainly be talking about Gaza. We're in very serious negotiations to, I guess you could say, depending on the way you count, 3,000 years, you could say 500 years, you could say… It's been raging for a long time and I think there's a possibility that we could have peace in the Middle East. It's something even beyond the Gaza situation. We want a release of the hostages immediately, et cetera. And so our team is over there now, another team just left and other countries, literally every country in the world has supported the plan.\n\nPrime Minister Carney (01:20):\n\nYep.\n\nPresident Trump (01:20):\n\nI don't think there's anybody that hasn't actually, not that I've seen, but there's a real chance that we could do something. So you may have some questions on that later. But in the meantime we'll spend some time and we'll make some deals and we'll do some things that are good for both of our countries. And Mark, it's an honor to have you. Thank you very much.\n\nPrime Minister Carney (01:39):\n\nThank you very much, Mr. President, if I may, you kindly hosted me and some of my colleagues a few months ago and I said, at the time, you are a transformative president. And since then, the transformation in the economy, unprecedented commitments of NATO partners to defense spending, peace from India-Pakistan, through to Azerbaijan- Armenia, disabling Iran is a force of terror. And now, and I'm running out of time, but this is many respects, the most important. What you created-\n\nPresident Trump (02:10):\n\nThe merger of Canada and the United States.\n\nPrime Minister Carney (02:12):\n\nNo.\n\nPresident Trump (02:12):\n\nI'm only kidding.\n\nPrime Minister Carney (02:14):\n\nThat wasn't where I was going. No. But on this solemn day of commemoration of the horrific attacks of October 7th, for the first time in decades, hundreds of years, thousands of years, this prospect of peace that you've made possible, Canada stands foursquare behind those efforts and we'll do whatever we can to support that.\n\nPresident Trump (02:37):\n\nVery nice.\n\nPrime Minister Carney (02:37):\n\nYep.\n\nPresident Trump (02:37):\n\nThank you, Mark, very much. Any questions?\n\nSpeaker 2 (02:38):\n\n[inaudible 00:02:39]\n\n(02:38)Mr. President, is there any… What would it take for you to draw or lower your tariffs on Canadian sectors including aluminum and steel?\n\nPresident Trump (02:50):\n\nWell, we're going to be talking about that with the Prime Minister and we'll be talking about tariffs, we'll be talking about a lot of that. But that's for a little bit later on.\n\n(02:59)I want to just acknowledge our great ambassador. Is he doing a good job?\n\nPrime Minister Carney (03:03):\n\nHe's doing a good job.\n\nPresident Trump (03:04):\n\nOtherwise I'll get him out of there so fast. No you have a [inaudible 00:03:11]-\n\nSpeaker 1 (03:12):\n\nIs it the White House's position that furloughed workers should be paid for their back pay?\n\nPresident Trump (03:18):\n\nI would say it depends on who we're talking about. I can tell you this, the Democrats have put a lot of people in great risk and jeopardy, but it really depends on who you're talking about. But for the most part, we're going to take care of our people. There are some people that really don't deserve to be taken care of and we'll take care of them in a different way. Okay? Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 3 (03:36):\n\n[inaudible 00:03:36]\n\n(03:36)Mr. President, in your opinion, why has Canada and the United States failed to reach an agreement up until now?\n\nPresident Trump (03:46):\n\nWell, it's a complicated agreement. More complicated maybe than any other agreement we have on trade because we have natural conflict. We also have mutual love. We have great love for each other. I love Canada and the people of Canada, and Mark feels the same way about here. The problem we have is that they want a car company and I want a car company, meaning the US wants a car company, and they want steel and we want steel. So in other countries they're very far away and there's no problem, you can compete and you can do. We don't like to compete because we sort of hurt each other when we compete. And so we have a natural conflict. It's a natural business conflict. Nothing wrong with it. And I think we've come a long way over the last few months actually, in terms of that relationship.\n\n(04:36)So when it comes to trade, the United States was always giving everything, they gave everything to Canada, they would let car companies leave here and go to Canada. But that hurts the United States. And other presidents didn't see that, they weren't business oriented, they might've been good politicians in some cases, not in all cases, they were bad at both. But it's a very natural conflict and it's something that we're working on.\n\n(05:04)Yes.\n\nSpeaker 4 (05:09):\n\n[inaudible 00:05:07]\n\n(05:09)Mr. President, Canada has offered a lot of compromise this summer. Are you willing today to offer some compromise to Canada maybe on steel and aluminum?\n\nPresident Trump (05:15):\n\nWell, we've made compromise and we've made some compromise even on steel, but we have the same basic authority and the same basic… This could be also a little bit of a conflict with other countries all over the world on steel because we want to make our own steel. We don't want to bring steel in for the most part. But we will bring it in and we do bring it in, we continue to bring it in from Canada, but there is a tariff to pay. And I think that would be a normal thing to say. But we've come a long way. I think, Howard, we can truly say. Do you want to make a comment on that?\n\nHoward (05:48):\n\nWell, I think the opportunity to work together, but as you've said, there's conflict. Why do we make cars in Canada? You've called that out and you've addressed that. So there are places we should work together and there are places that we have natural conflict.\n\nPresident Trump (06:02):\n\nIt's a tough situation because we want to make our cars here. At the same time, we want Canada to do well making cars. So we're working on formulas and I think we'll get there.\n\nSpeaker 5 (06:20):\n\n[inaudible 00:06:17]\n\n(06:20)Canadians are refusing to go to the US, the numbers are down like 23% in the first seven months of the year. What do you say to Canadians that don't want to go to the US now because of your 51st state talk, because of the trade war, the tariffs, and fear [inaudible 00:06:36]-\n\nPresident Trump (06:36):\n\nI understand that. Look, I understand that. And Americans don't want to buy cars that are made in Canada. I mean, we have the same conflict. So, it's something that will get worked out. There's still great love between the two countries, but American people want product here, they want to make it here. Detroit was emptied out and moved to Canada and moved to Mexico, moved to other places, not just Canada. And now they're all moving back. They're moving back.\n\n(07:06)Right now, I was just telling Mark, we have 17 trillion, but it's really much higher, that was as of a couple of months ago.\n\nPrime Minister Carney (07:12):\n\nYep. Yep.\n\nPresident Trump (07:13):\n\nWe have over $17 trillion being invested now in the United States. As an example, Biden, he was the worst president we've ever had, but they had less than 1 trillion in four years. We have more than 17 trillion in eight months. Eight months. And I think that number is going to be 21, $22 trillion. There's never been anything like that in the history of the world for any country. Not even close. If you did 1 trillion in a year, that's pretty good. We're going to do over 20, and it's coming in with AI, it's coming in with auto plants. We're building auto plants, a lot of auto plants in the US. It's coming in for a lot of reasons. It's coming in because of the fact, I think the November 5th election was a big factor and I think the tariffs are a big factor.\n\n(08:02)And again, we want Canada to do great, but there's a point at which we also want the same business. We're competing for the same business. That's the problem. That's why I keep mentioning one way to solve that problem is a very easy way, but we're competing for the same business. He wants to make cars, we want to make cars, and we're in competition. And the advantage we have is we have this massive market. So it's quite an advantage.\n\nSpeaker 6 (08:36):\n\n[inaudible 00:08:31] Mr. President, can we talk about Portland for a second? Are you planning to invoke the Insurrection Act and that would be a very long-standing war of law that's been on the books?\n\nPresident Trump (08:47):\n\nYeah. Well, it's been invoked before, as you know. If you look at Chicago, Chicago is a great city where there's a lot of crime and if the governor can't do the job, we'll do the job. It's all very simple.\n\nPresident Trump (09:00):\n\nThey probably had 50 murders in Chicago over the last five, six, seven months, many people were shot. And then, the governor gets up and he says, \"Well, we can handle it.\" They can't handle it, they don't know what they're doing. The mayor is grossly incompetent, he's at a 4% approval rating in Chicago. He's at a 4% lowest approval rating, lower than even de Blasio had, which is hard to believe, in New York. I thought de Blasio would always maintain that record, but the Chicago guy is even lower.\n\n(09:31)So I think that we want safe cities. If you look at D.C., you would, right now, Mark, you could go out, take your family out to dinner, you could walk right down the middle of the street, there is no crime in D.C. When I got here, this place was a raging hellhole, where people would come from Canada, people would come from other places, and end up getting shot. Nobody's being shot. The National Guard's been unbelievable, they are strong, tough guys.\n\n(10:04)We won something at the Supreme Court, which is a big deal, merit. Everything now in this country is merit-based. I didn't think I'd ever see it again. And we have our soldiers are merit-based too, and they're central casting. And they walk through that town, and I'll tell you what, this place is safe, it's beautiful. Now, we're in Memphis and the same thing's happening, you're getting the reports, the bad guys that say, \"We don't want anything to do with this.\"\n\n(10:29)And we're removing many people. In D.C., we took out 1,700 career criminals and sent them back to the countries from which they came, mostly let out by Biden and his people that had an open border policy. And Canada, you suffered because of that too, because they'd come here and they'd go into Canada also. So we're like a buffer for that in terms of… Canada suffered greatly by Biden and the policy of open border, totally unchecked, totally unvetted, and these people were… If you got 5%, 2%, now you were getting a lot of bad people.\n\nPrime Minister Carney (11:10):\n\nAnd now we're tightening the border, yep.\n\nPresident Trump (11:11):\n\nAnd we now have a closed border. Yep, you've done well. We have a closed border, and it's a really closed border. In fact, for four months, I don't even know if this is possible, but the figures were released, zero people were able to come into the United States from the southern border, zero. And as you know, we've taken a very hard stand on drugs, this is also benefiting you. We call them the water drugs, the drugs that come in through water. They're not coming, there are no boats anymore. Frankly, there are no fishing boats. There's no boats out there, period, if you want to know the truth. We're saying, \"Does anybody go fishing anymore?\" The fact is we've probably saved at least 100,000 lives, American lives, Canadian lives, by taking out all those boats coming in. And now they don't come in that way anymore, now they'll come in other ways, and we're not going to allow that either.\n\nSpeaker 7 (12:06):\n\n[inaudible 00:12:08]\n\nPresident Trump (12:07):\n\nSo we've done a great job on that.\n\n(12:10)But on crime, Chicago's a great city, but you can't be a great city if you have murders and if you have a lot of problems, and they do. And they have an incompetent policy, just like they had open border policy, anybody could come in. They came in from prisons, they came in from mental institutions, drug dealers, they came in from all over the place, and we don't have that anymore. This country is becoming very… We're a very strong country.\n\n(12:37)Look, financially speaking, I would say that because of the tariffs, because of the election, because of the policy, because of the Great Big Beautiful Deal, I added the word great, because it really is, it's the biggest bill ever passed in the history of our country, we don't need another bill. It's the biggest tax cuts, the biggest… When you think no tax on tips, no tax on Social Security, no tax on overtime for the people. But far beyond that, what it does is it incentivizes auto plants and AI and all of the things that… Nobody's ever passed a bill like it. We don't need another bill, we don't need any more bills. I said, \"Let's get it all at once.\"\n\n(13:16)I was greatly helped by our speaker, Mike Johnson, and by the Senate. I'll tell you what, John Thune's been… Both of those guys have been incredible. And we got a bill passed that we really… I said, \" Let's see if we can get it all done,\" because these Democrats are like insurrectionists, they're so bad for our country, their policy is so bad for our country. I said, \"Let's see if we can get it all done in the…\" And everybody said, \"It's not doable.\" Because it's the biggest bill ever passed in the history of our country, and we got it all done. We don't need anything else, we've got everything we want.\n\n(13:51)And now, because of that, that's a big reason why the companies are coming in, one-year depreciation, one-year write-off, one-year expensing. Nobody's ever seen anything like it.\n\nAudience (14:03):\n\nMr. President, Mr. President.\n\nPresident Trump (14:05):\n\nSo they're coming in from all over the world. But to have a great country, you can't have crime, and we don't have crime. But we have cities where there's tremendous crime, and Chicago's one of them, and if the governor can't straighten it out, we'll straighten it out. Thank you.\n\nAudience (14:20):\n\n[inaudible 00:14:22]\n\nPresident Trump (14:25):\n\nA question for the Prime Minister?\n\nSpeaker 8 (14:27):\n\n[inaudible 00:14:28] Mr. President, do you remain committed to-\n\nSpeaker 9 (14:30):\n\nMr. Prime Minister, I'd like to know, how come the UK and the European Union have succeeded to sign deals and bring the tariffs down, and Canada still hasn't been able to do the same?\n\nPresident Trump (14:39):\n\nYeah, because they're not located right next to each other. In many cases, it's much better and easier, but… Please.\n\nPrime Minister Carney (14:47):\n\nYeah, if I may, let's be clear about the relationship as it stands right now. We are the second-largest trading partner of the United States. We do a lot of trade going across the border where we're cooperating, first thing. Secondly, we are the largest foreign investor in the United States, half a trillion dollars in the last five years alone, probably $8 trillion in the next five years if we get the agreement that we expect to get. Thirdly, there are areas, as the President just said, where we… Conflict, maybe not so much conflict, we compete, there are areas where we compete, and it's in those areas where we have to come to an agreement that works. But there are more areas where we are stronger together, and that's what we're focused on, and we're going to get the right deal, the right deal for America, the right deal, obviously, from my perspective, for Canada.\n\nAudience (15:34):\n\n[inaudible 00:15:36]\n\nPresident Trump (15:45):\n\nIncluding one thing that… Easy. Wait, wait, wait. So one thing where we are working very closely is the Golden Dome, that's the protective mechanism, and you see how that works, it's unbelievable. Ronald Reagan wanted to have it, and at that time, they didn't have the technology, even close to the technology, but he was advanced. And we'll be working together on a Golden Dome for the two countries, and it's something that I think is going to be very important, especially when you look at the world, you look at what's happening, we want to have that protection. It's really amazing, the technology is unbelievable.\n\nAudience (16:19):\n\n[inaudible 00:16:20]\n\nSpeaker 10 (16:19):\n\nMr. President, why do you say some federal workers should not get their back pay, why do you say some-\n\nPresident Trump (16:28):\n\nWell, you're going to have to figure that out, okay? Ask the Democrats that question.\n\nAudience (16:32):\n\n[inaudible 00:16:33]\n\nPresident Trump (16:32):\n\nGo ahead.\n\nSpeaker 10 (16:34):\n\nMr. President, just to follow up there, the law says that when the government is reopened, that workers will receive their back pay, so are you going to defy the law there or what-\n\nPresident Trump (16:43):\n\nI follow the law, and what the law says is correct, and I follow the law. I always-\n\nAudience (16:51):\n\n[inaudible 00:16:51]\n\nSpeaker 11 (16:51):\n\nMr. President, will Canada be leaving empty-handed, or Mr. Carney be leaving Washington with a deal on tariffs?\n\nPresident Trump (16:58):\n\nI think they're going to be very happy. We have a lot of things that we're working on that people don't talk about. They talk about competitiveness, he's a very competitive person, and they talk about things that we don't necessarily agree on. But I think they're going to walk away very happy, I think so.\n\nAudience (17:17):\n\n[inaudible 00:17:18]\n\nSpeaker 12 (17:23):\n\nMr. President, on all your trade deals that you've signed, there's been a minimum tariff that countries have got. When USMCA gets renegotiated, do you want a minimum tariff on goods between Canada and the US?\n\nPresident Trump (17:33):\n\nWell, we're going to have tariffs between Canada, and they have them with us. I will say, with our pharmas, as you know, they went up to as much as 400%, 250%, 300%, and even one at 401%, we found one, having to do with a very small product, but it was high.\n\nSpeaker 12 (17:50):\n\nBut you [inaudible 00:17:51] Canada.\n\nPresident Trump (17:51):\n\nSo we've always had tariffs between the two of us. And actually, Canada was charging us very high tariffs on our agricultural things, a lot of our agricultural\n\nPresident Trump (18:00):\n\n… agricultural product, and that's one of the things that we talk about for bringing that down. So this is a mutual thing, but we've been charged tariffs. Look, we are the king of being screwed by tariffs, just so you understand, and I'm not talking about with Canada, I'm talking about with countries all over the world. When you look at Europe, when you look at China, when you look at all of the… Almost every country charge the U.S. We didn't charge them because we were led by stupid people, in many cases. Stupid people. They took advantage of our country. They're not taking advantage of us anymore. If you looked at European Union, they're all my friends. I don't blame them. I blame our presidents. I blame our past presidents and business leaders. But we are the king of countries that have been taken advantage of for many, many years. We've been paying trillions and trillions of dollars and receiving nothing. Nothing at all.\n\n(18:59)As an example, prior to the deal with Europe where they pay a lot of money, but they're happy and I'm happy, the deal was good. It's a fair deal. But it wasn't fair. You couldn't put a car into Europe. You couldn't sell your agriculture into Europe. You couldn't do anything. And now we have it so that it's open. We charge them tariffs. We didn't charge them tariffs for car. They charge us tremendous. I said to Angela Merkel once, I said, \"How many cars have gone to Germany from the United States?\" And she said, \"Well, I don't believe any.\" And I said, \"You're right. You're right. Well, that doesn't happen anymore.\" And they're paying a fair amount. It's just a fair amount. It's not… I could ask for much more. It's a fair amount.\n\n(19:42)But the United States now is using the same thing that they've used on us. And I just can't believe it's taken presidents so long to do this. And again, we're going to treat people fairly. We're going to especially treat Canada fairly, but I can't believe it's taken so long where we get charged and don't charge them.\n\n(20:01)Japan was a good example. We made a deal with Japan.\n\nPrime Minister Carney (20:03):\n\nYeah.\n\nPresident Trump (20:04):\n\nYou saw that, Mark.\n\nPrime Minister Carney (20:04):\n\nYeah.\n\nPresident Trump (20:05):\n\nA deal with Japan. It's a much different deal than we've had in the past, but they would send us millions of cars. No charge. We weren't allowed to send them cars. We sent them no cars. I doubt you had one car go into… Because we were restricted. They didn't want our cars. Same thing with Europe, same thing with other places. All we do now is fairness. But fairness leads us to the most successful country there's ever been. We have some advantages over other countries, and we do have a great market. We have an amazing market. But you know what? If I let this go, if we didn't win this election, if we had these people that were running, that were ruining our country, destroying our country with their open borders and men playing in women's sports and transgender from everybody and windmills all over the place, if we allowed that to go on for another couple of years, we would be… I'm not sure that we'd even have a country.\n\nSpeaker 13 (21:05):\n\n[inaudible 00:21:06].\n\nPresident Trump (21:13):\n\nYeah, Brian? By the way, I'm not sure we would've even had a country. And now we have the most successful country in the world. Brian?\n\nBrian (21:21):\n\nYes, sir. What is your message to Democrats ahead of a next vote to open up the government? The American people are saying, \"Open the damn government.\"\n\nPresident Trump (21:29):\n\nRight.\n\nBrian (21:29):\n\nWhat's your message to them right now?\n\nPresident Trump (21:30):\n\nWell, they're the ones that started it. They're the ones that have it. And it's almost like a kamikaze attack by them. You want to know the truth? This is like a kamikaze attack. They almost… They have nothing to lose. They've lost the elections. They've lost the presidential election in a landslide.\n\n(21:51)I saw the other day where Kamala said, \"This was a very close election.\" This was one of the biggest sweeps that anybody's ever had. Won the popular vote by millions, won the electoral college by a massive amount. They said if I got 270, that would be great. But I got, I think, 312 or 315 and they got 220. So we won that. But we won counties. The big thing is counties. So out of all of the counties, thousands and thousands, we got 2,500. They got 525. It was a landslide and we listened. Oh, yes, it was close. It was one of the greatest victories ever. And it was a mandate to do what we're doing.\n\n(22:36)And I hope, and Mark wants this as much as I do, we are very close to making a deal on the Middle East that will bring peace to the Middle East. After all of these years of millions and millions, tens of millions of people being killed, there's a chance to bring peace to the Middle East.\n\n(22:54)In addition to that, I made seven other deals and they were great, and where things are happening with respect to Russia, Ukraine. That's one that last week, Mark, 7,812 people were killed.\n\nPrime Minister Carney (23:10):\n\nThat's terrible.\n\nPresident Trump (23:10):\n\nSoldiers.\n\nPrime Minister Carney (23:11):\n\nYep.\n\nPresident Trump (23:11):\n\nMostly soldiers.\n\nPrime Minister Carney (23:11):\n\nYeah.\n\nPresident Trump (23:11):\n\nBut 7,000… More than 7,000, almost 8,000 soldiers were killed. It's a crazy thing. I thought that would've been one of the easy ones. I get along very well with Putin, and I thought that would've been… I'm very disappointed in him because I thought this would've been an easy one to settle. But it's turned out to be maybe tougher than the Middle East. We'll see what happens with the Middle East. The Middle East-\n\nSpeaker 13 (23:34):\n\n[inaudible 00:23:38].\n\nPrime Minister Carney (23:34):\n\n[inaudible 00:23:38].\n\nPresident Trump (23:34):\n\n[inaudible 00:23:38].\n\nPrime Minister Carney (23:34):\n\n[inaudible 00:23:38].\n\nPresident Trump (23:41):\n\n[inaudible 00:23:38]. Go ahead. Behind. Yes?\n\nSpeaker 14 (23:45):\n\nIs the fentanyl crisis over with Canada, which is the Canadian border?\n\nPresident Trump (23:49):\n\nIs what?\n\nSpeaker 14 (23:49):\n\nThe fentanyl crisis.\n\nSpeaker 15 (23:50):\n\nFentanyl.\n\nPresident Trump (23:52):\n\nNo, it's not over. I think it's never going to be over, frankly. But they've done… Canada's worked hard and they've done a much better job than in the past.\n\nPrime Minister Carney (24:00):\n\nYep.\n\nPresident Trump (24:00):\n\nWe have very few people coming in through our southern border, too. We've worked with Canada and we've worked with Mexico, so we've made it a lot better.\n\nSpeaker 13 (24:08):\n\n[inaudible 00:24:09].\n\nPrime Minister Carney (24:09):\n\nLook, any is too much. Any is too much [inaudible 00:24:13].\n\nPresident Trump (24:15):\n\nYeah. Wait.\n\nPrime Minister Carney (24:17):\n\nOn Fentanyl, any amount is too much. So we've gotten it down. It's down substantially. It's less than 1%, but look, it's still too much. It's too much at home in Canada.\n\nPresident Trump (24:26):\n\nA lot of people.\n\nPrime Minister Carney (24:26):\n\nYeah. We got to stamp it out.\n\nSpeaker 13 (24:27):\n\n[inaudible 00:24:28].\n\nSpeaker 16 (24:27):\n\nOn USMCA, are the two of you both committed to seeing it through in the renegotiation of that deal that you made?\n\nPresident Trump (24:37):\n\nWell, we can renegotiate it and that would be good. Or we could just do different deals. We're allowed to do different deals. If we were, we might make deals that are better for the individual-\n\nSpeaker 16 (24:45):\n\nWhat's your preference?\n\nPresident Trump (24:47):\n\n… countries. I don't care. I want to make whatever the best deal is for this country and also very much with Canada in mind.\n\nSpeaker 13 (24:52):\n\n[inaudible 00:24:53].\n\nPresident Trump (24:56):\n\nYeah, go ahead, please. Go ahead, sir.\n\nSpeaker 5 (24:58):\n\nSir, on China, what more can the United States and Canada do together to counter China?\n\nPresident Trump (25:06):\n\nWell, you have to be able to compete. They're a great competitor. And Mark and I both know that, and you have to be able to compete. We have big advantages over China for lots of different reasons, and I think we're doing very well with China. I get along very well with President Xi. I'm going to be meeting him in a few weeks, as you know. I'll be meeting him in South Korea. But we've had a very good relationship for a long time. But you have to be able to compete. To do well with China, if you can't compete, you're not going to do well with China. And Canada's very competitive. I can tell you that. Canada's a very competitive country, and I think Canada's done very well over the years with China.\n\nPrime Minister Carney (25:42):\n\nYeah. Yeah, we have, but we'll do better together-\n\nPresident Trump (25:45):\n\nYeah.\n\nPrime Minister Carney (25:45):\n\n… on that.\n\nSpeaker 13 (25:45):\n\n[inaudible 00:25:46].\n\nSpeaker 17 (25:45):\n\nOn the Middle East, what guarantees are you giving your Arab partners that Israel will not resume its offensive after the hostages are released?\n\nPresident Trump (25:59):\n\nWell, the primary guarantee is once this deal happens, if it does happen, look, they're in negotiations right now, we are going to do everything possible. We have a lot of power, and we're going to do everything possible to make sure everybody adheres to the deal. Okay?\n\nSpeaker 13 (26:12):\n\n[inaudible 00:26:13].\n\nSpeaker 18 (26:17):\n\nAre you concerned about the delays at airports? And how do you see the shutdown lately?\n\nPresident Trump (26:20):\n\nOh, sure. I mean, they're all Democrat delays. There are delays at the airport. That's standard. And again, this is something that we've… Every day we put forth a bill, just a continuation, it's a very simple thing to sign and very simple to do. And I really think that these are people that I think they have nothing to lose. They have a party that's out of control. They have no leader. Nobody knows who the leader is. I look at people with very low IQs, like Crockett, this woman, Crockett, I never met her, but she's a low-IQ individual. I look at AOC talking about how, \"If they want to negotiate, they can come to my office.\" She's not in that position to do that, and\n\nPresident Trump (27:00):\n\nWho the hell is she to say that? And then I watched Nancy Pelosi not knowing what to do. I watched their leadership. Look, Schumer is petrified of a primary because he's not going to win probably against anybody in a primary. Schumer did the right thing, but he handled it badly. Originally, a year ago, he did probably the right thing, but he handled it badly. I think Schumer is incapable of making a deal. They are a mess. They're a party that has no leadership. And they have no policy. I think we have great leadership, but we also have great policy. We have strong borders. We have no men in women's sports. I mean, basic things. We're not going to take your child away and change the sex of your child. We're not going to do things like that. What they're doing to the country is so incredible, and they got away with it with all their woke crap, and now it's stopped. And we have a country that's based on common sense, and strength, and intelligence.\n\n(28:06)The United States of America, and I say it all the time, other leaders have told me this, Mark hasn't yet, but I think he would, a year ago we were a dead country, and now we are the hottest country anywhere in the world. Maybe Canada. I'll give Canada, because I do like Canada. But we're the hottest country in the world right now. There's never been a country that has the kind of money coming into it. There's never been anything like this. There's never been a country that, if you get take a trillion dollars, that would be unbelievable. We're going to have over $20 trillion invested in this country. There's never been anything like what you're seeing, and it's based on good policy, and common sense, and leadership. Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 19 (28:53):\n\nMr. President, what is Canada giving you in return? You say Mr. Carney is going to be leaving Washington happy. What's Canada giving you in return?\n\nPresident Trump (28:58):\n\nWell, you'll find out, but I think the people of Canada, they will love us again. Most of them still do. If you say only 25%. I assume a lot of them. I think they love us.\n\n(29:16)And you know what, I'm not the biggest hockey fan, but I like it a lot. And I watched some of the greatest hockey games I've ever… How good were those games, right?\n\nSpeaker 20 (29:25):\n\nYeah, very good.\n\n(29:26)We're coming down for the World Series, Mr. President.\n\nPresident Trump (29:28):\n\nOh good.\n\nSpeaker 20 (29:28):\n\n[inaudible 00:29:29].\n\nPresident Trump (29:34):\n\nYeah, go.\n\nSpeaker 21 (29:34):\n\nMr. President, will you sign a trade deal with Canada that doesn't include supply-managed goods like dairy, for example, the federal government's-\n\nPresident Trump (29:47):\n\nWell, a deal would include dairy. I mean, it's going to include everything. We'll do a comprehensive.\n\nSpeaker 22 (29:51):\n\nMr. President, have you identified programs to eliminate under this shutdown?\n\nPresident Trump (29:58):\n\nOh, sure, sure.\n\nSpeaker 22 (30:00):\n\nWhich ones?\n\nPresident Trump (30:01):\n\nI'm not going to tell you, but we'll be announcing it pretty soon. But we have a lot of things that we're going to eliminate, and permanently eliminate. One of the things that we have as some advantage, you could say, but because of the shutdown, which I think they made a big mistake, we're able to take out billions and billions of dollars of waste, fraud, and abuse. And they've handed it on a silver platter. And Russell Vought, he's a serious person, very serious person. And he's sitting there and he's getting ready to cut things. And this is something that was handed to us by, I assume, Schumer. I just don't know if Schumer has any power anymore. I look at your leadership. I don't know who to speak to.\n\n(30:42)I'll tell you what, I'm getting calls from Democrats wanting to meet. I never even heard their names before, and they're claiming to be leader. The Democrats have no leader. They remind me of Somalia. And I met the president of Somalia. I told him about the problem he's got. I said, \"You have somebody from Somalia who's telling us how to run our country from Somalia.\" I said, \"Would you like to take her back?\" He said, \"No, I don't want her.\"\n\n(31:10)Okay, you know who I'm talking about?\n\nSpeaker 23 (31:11):\n\n[inaudible 00:31:12].\n\nPresident Trump (31:14):\n\nSay it again.\n\nSpeaker 23 (31:15):\n\nHow many permanent jobs are you talking about [inaudible 00:31:18]-\n\nPresident Trump (31:17):\n\nWell, I'll be able to tell you that in four or five days if this keeps going on. If this keeps going on, it'll be substantial, and a lot of those jobs will never come back. You're going to have a lot closer to a balanced budget, actually.\n\nSpeaker 24 (31:39):\n\nIs there anything the Prime Minister has done that's making it more difficult to reach a deal?\n\nPresident Trump (31:42):\n\nSay it?\n\nSpeaker 24 (31:43):\n\nIs there anything that the Prime Minister has done that's making it more difficult or easier to reach a deal?\n\nPresident Trump (31:48):\n\nNo, I think he's a great prime minister. He could represent me anytime. No, he is a very strong, very good leader. He's a nice man, but he could be nasty. He could be very nasty. Maybe as nasty as anybody.\n\n(32:06)Let me put it this way, I can tell you this, because I deal with lots of leaders all over the world, he is a world-class leader. He's a man that knows what he wants, and I'm not surprised to see that he won the election, and won it substantially. And I would think he's more popular now. He's a good man. He does a great job, and he's a tough negotiator.\n\nSpeaker 25 (32:33):\n\nSo then, what's holding things up? If he's a great man, and you want to do a deal with Canada, why aren't you?\n\nPresident Trump (32:38):\n\nBecause I want to be a great man, too. Thank you very much. Thank you, everybody.\n\n(33:05)[inaudible 00:33:05].\n\nSpeaker 20 (33:05):\n\nI think you got that one.\n\nPresident Trump (33:05):\n\nThat could have been [inaudible 00:33:05].\n\n(33:05)Thank you very much.\n\n(33:05)Thank you.\n\n(33:05)Thank you very much.\n\n(33:05)[inaudible 00:33:07].",

    "date": "",
    "transcript": "Donald Trump (00:16):\n\nWell, thank you very much everybody. We have a very big signing today having to do with Alaska, a place that I'm very familiar with. And we're making it greater, bigger, and more powerful, and job- producing. It's an economic gold mine, so to speak. And I signed this years ago, and Biden unsigned it for me. This was something that should have been long operating and making billions of dollars for our country, and supplying a lot of energy and minerals and everything else that we're talking about. And they undid it, and wasted a lot of time and a lot of money, a lot of effort. And now we're starting again, and this time we have plenty of time to get it done and it's going to be done properly. I'd like to ask your Department of Interior Head, who has done a fantastic job, Doug Burgum, to say a few words about it. And we'll go to Chris after you, and anybody else that wants to say something. And it's a very powerful deal, very, very big deal from the standpoint of minerals and energy. So thank you all for being here. Doug, please go ahead.\n\nDoug Burgum (01:22):\n\nWell, thank you President Trump. Yesterday is a historic day. President Trump, as he promised when he was running in the election to the American people, that he was going to unlock the potential of this country, he was going to unlock America's mineral wealth. He was going to generate… he was going to… Supply chains around critical minerals for our country. On Day 1 he signed a very important executive order, unleashing Alaska's extraordinary resource potential. And this is part of the continuation, there's a number of things that have already happened with Alaska that are moving forward, there's more to come, but big milestone today.\n\n(02:03)In reversing this Biden decision about the Ambler Road, this is a 211-mil-long road that begins over 200 miles north of Fairbanks off the Haul Road that goes up to the north slope. This road goes through an area where there's no roads. Ambler Mining District at the end of that has some of the richest mining deposits in all of America and in all of the world. And these are minerals that are absolutely essential to defense to industry moving forward today. Just take copper alone, this is one of the richest copper locations in the country. And of course, today to build a data center, you can have tens of thousands of tons of copper required for that. Even a single family home today may have as much as 400 pounds of copper in a home.\n\n(02:54)And we have, as a nation, in the past basically gotten out of the mineral and energy and mining area. President Trump, when he said, \"Drill, baby, drill,\" he also was, mine, baby, mine. We've got to get back in the mining business. China controls 85 to a 100% of all the mining and refining of the top 20 critical minerals. And in this mine area up there, we got copper, lead, zinc, gold, silver, gallium, germanium. So rich in all of the minerals that we need to win the AI arms race against China, and to prosper as a country. And so again, today this was history being made. When some of this was set aside in 1980 by Jimmy Carter there was a special authority created for presidents to decide if there was a dispute. And so for the first time in history, a president is actually using that authority, President Trump as he does, using his authority for the benefit of the American people. And the appeal came in from the state of Alaska asking that this road be built. Alaska is not a colony, they're a state. They have an opportunity to build roads like any other state. With this signing, President Trump, Alaska can go ahead and build this road. It'll be a toll road, not a public road. It's a toll road, so it'll be controlled in terms of traffic. It's a gravel road. It'll be sensitive to the environment. There'll be collaboration with the native Alaskan corporations in terms of how it's built and how it's used, supporting the Alaskan native tribes with subsistence hunting regulations on either side of this. But this opens up a wealth resources. In addition, there's going to be an announcement made later today that is part of this announcement, that the Department of War, the United States Government is making an investment in Trilogy Minerals. They're one of the companies that has mining claims in this area that is remote wilderness right now. And again, making that investment so we can make sure that we're securing these critical mineral supplies, and that ownership in that company will benefit the American people. With that, I'll kick it over to Chris Wright.\n\nChris Wright (05:04):\n\nThank you, Doug. And what a huge thank you to the president today. This is a tremendous achievement for the people of Alaska. We were in the North Slope of Alaska a few months ago, celebrating energy development there. They want jobs and opportunity to develop the resources on their lands. This is another major step forward. We say energy's the lifeblood of society, the circulatory system. Minerals and metals, they're the skeletal infrastructure, the physical upholding of everything we do, everywhere we walk and operate, your cameras, everything you hold are made out of minerals and minerals. President Biden thought it was appropriate to offshore both of these industries outside of our country, that has not left us in a strong place. President Trump in his first term, and even more strongly in his second term, is bringing those industries back to our country.\n\n(05:55)America was a mining powerhouse for a long, long time, and our mining industry got squelched. Now, we're seeing it come back to life. You saw the President's truth not long ago about a deal for lithium production in Nevada just a week or so ago. This will more than tenfold increase American lithium production. And this infrastructure, this mining road in the Ambler Mining District, will just have immense impact on future mining opportunities for our country's security and economic opportunities for the people of Alaska. Our critical minerals and mining expert within the administration is standing right next to me, David Copley. I'll see if he wants to add new words.\n\nDavid Copley (06:34):\n\nThis is a really big deal for the American mining industry. And I think it shows the President's seriousness about getting this industry going, and making sure we have the critical minerals we need for our defense industrial base and for our broader economy.\n\nDonald Trump (06:45):\n\nThank you very much. And I think we want to get this going by a certain time-\n\nWill Scharf (06:49):\n\nYes, sir.\n\nDonald Trump (06:49):\n\n… so I signed it. And Will, I'm going to give it to you, and you get it filed.\n\nWill Scharf (06:53):\n\nYes, sir.\n\nDonald Trump (06:54):\n\nGood job.\n\nWill Scharf (06:54):\n\nThank you, sir.\n\nDonald Trump (06:55):\n\nIt's a big job. Thank you very much.\n\nWill Scharf (06:56):\n\n[inaudible 00:07:02].\n\nDonald Trump (07:02):\n\nSo we created a great deal of wealth for that part of the world and that part of our country by doing this long, very difficult road to build. And we'll be talking about that sometime later. But it's a great deal for our country, it's a great deal for the people of our country and for the taxpayers of our country. And if you have any questions on that, let me know, Steve.\n\nSteve (07:25):\n\nWhen do you expect the road that we've constructed, and how quickly will I get underway?\n\nDonald Trump (07:28):\n\nGo ahead.\n\nDoug Burgum (07:30):\n\nWell, this road, I said industrial road, it'll have ownership. It'll likely be split between the state of Alaska, the federal government, and the native Alaska corporations. We would expect that construction would begin next spring with planning throughout this winter. The 211-mile-long road will be a gravel road with a solid design base to handle the weight of the trucks that are going in and out. This is typical design that far north because asphalt with a freeze-thaw cycle, very difficult with asphalt or concrete. So gravel, a fantastic gravel road, is going to have the least impact on the environment, it's going to be the best-suited purpose.\n\n(08:09)Alaska's done this in the past with the Red Dog Mine. They built a toll road that again has ownership. The companies that use the road pay to transit that road, so this is an economic model used around the world in mining districts, we'll apply it right here. And again, it's going to generate revenue for the American people and for the citizens of Alaska as opposed to a cost.\n\nDonald Trump (08:32):\n\nAnd also two bridges. We're going to build two bridges that will be-\n\nSteve (08:36):\n\nIt'll probably [inaudible 00:08:37]-\n\nDonald Trump (08:36):\n\n… able to complete, and we'll get them up very quickly.\n\nSteve (08:39):\n\nAnd how long do you complete? I mean, 211 miles, I suppose [inaudible 00:08:42]-\n\nDonald Trump (08:41):\n\nYes. We'll get it done in less than a year.\n\nDoug Burgum (08:44):\n\nIt's going to come in, yeah, three phases. The first road, as President Trump said, we'll go quickly, which is, they call it a pilot road. We'll build a single-lane, gravel road through the full duration of it. That'll be then expanded to a second phase and then a third phase over time. But again, we want to get that pilot road built because then we can help get materials back to help the mine get started quickly as well.\n\nCaitlyn (09:09):\n\nMr. President, there's negotiations happening with your team in Egypt right now over your proposed peace plan. It was reported by Axios over the weekend that you had a call with Prime Minister Netanyahu, where you told him to stop being so negative, and to take the win when it came to Hamas's response to that. Is that true, and what else did you say to him?\n\nDonald Trump (09:25):\n\nNo, it's not true. He's been very positive, he's been very positive on the deal, everybody is. I think every nation is. We have just about every nation working on this deal and trying to get it done. Something that you could say 3,000 years if you look at it in certain ways, or you could say centuries. But this is a deal that, incredibly everyone just came together, they all came together. No, Israel's been great. They've all been good, Caitlyn.\n\nCaitlyn (09:50):\n\nAnd in the negotiations, do you have any red lines in terms of Hamas, disarming and whatnot? Are there any places you're willing to negotiate?\n\nDonald Trump (09:56):\n\nNo, I have red lines. If certain things aren't met, we're not going to do it. But I think we're doing very well. And I think Hamas has been agreeing to things that are very important.\n\nSpeaker 1 (10:09):\n\nMr. President.\n\nSpeaker 2 (10:09):\n\nMr. President.\n\nSpeaker 3 (10:09):\n\nMr. President.\n\nSpeaker 2 (10:10):\n\nMr. President, the government shutdown. Mr. President, if the vote today fails in the Senate, will that trigger layoffs?\n\nDonald Trump (10:14):\n\nIt could. At some point it will. And the Democrats are the ones that started this. And if you think about, it's about healthcare to a large extent. We want great healthcare for people, we don't want to give the money away to other people that come pouring into our country. And they've already poured because nobody's coming into our country now, we have the border totally stopped. In fact, numbers, we just announced again, we're at another zero. So we have zero for four months in a row. Zero people coming into our country illegally, that's a pretty good number.\n\n(10:42)I'm not sure, even I can believe that, Doug, if you want know the truth. Zero, we went from millions of people to zero, but it's pretty close to that number. And the way you stop them is not to give away, not to announce that you're giving everybody free healthcare, free this and that. But what that does, it affects the American people because the American people are unable to get good healthcare.\n\n(11:05)Obama Care has been a wreck, as you know. And to do that, we have to keep it propped up and do the best you can with it. It's a mess. But a lot of things are going on in that. We talk about Hamas, we talk about negotiations that we have going on right now. We have a negotiation going on right now with the Democrats that could lead to very good things.\n\nSpeaker 3 (11:27):\n\nWhat kind of negotiations? Are you speaking Democratic leaders?\n\nDonald Trump (11:29):\n\nAnd I'm talking about good things with regard to healthcare.\n\nSpeaker 3 (11:31):\n\nAre you speaking with Democratic leaders? What kind of negotiation's going on?\n\nDonald Trump (11:33):\n\nWell, I don't want to say that. I don't want to say that, but we are speaking with the Democrats. And some very good things could happen with respect to healthcare.\n\nSpeaker 4 (11:42):\n\nWould you make a deal with them on the ACA subsidies?\n\nDonald Trump (11:46):\n\nIf we made the right deal, I'd make a deal, sure.\n\nSpeaker 4 (11:47):\n\nSo you would [inaudible 00:11:48]-\n\nDonald Trump (11:48):\n\nI mean, You have right now subsidies. You have subsidies, that's the problem with Obama Care. The subsidies are so much, it's billions and billions of dollars is being wasted. And we can have a much better healthcare that\n\nDonald Trump (12:00):\n\n… That we have right now and we're talking to them. I'm not saying that's going to happen because this has also been going on, not for 3,000 years, but it's been going on for a long time. But yeah, we're talking to the Democrats.\n\nSpeaker 5 (12:10):\n\nYou would work to make a deal with them on [inaudible 00:12:13]?\n\nDonald Trump (12:13):\n\nI'd like to see a deal made for great healthcare. I want to see great health… I'm a Republican, but I want to see healthcare much more so than the Democrats.\n\nSpeaker 6 (12:21):\n\nSo, Mr. President, on all of this, as you know, the American people are experiencing a lot of pain with any kind of government shutdown. And while you're dealing with Democrats, and of course, Republicans are standing their ground, what is your message directly to the American people who may encounter some of this pain and despair? How do you give them hope?\n\nDonald Trump (12:39):\n\nWell, up until now, there hasn't been a great deal of pain. There could be a great deal of pain, but up until now there hasn't been. I will say this, just hang in there because I think a lot of good things are going to happen. That's all I can say. I think a lot of good things could happen and that could also pertain to healthcare.\n\nSpeaker 7 (12:55):\n\nMr. President.\n\nSpeaker 6 (12:57):\n\nA follow-up question.\n\nJournalists (12:57):\n\nHave seen a surge in attacks on ICE agents across the country, including the shooting in Dallas and over the weekend in Chicago, we saw 10 cars boxing in on ICE agents and another one ramming into an ICE vehicle. We have heard Secretary Noem saying that some of these attackers are actually organized and they're planning to carelessly ambush these officers. What are the consequences for these [inaudible 00:13:18]?\n\nDonald Trump (13:18):\n\nVery severe. We're going to have very severe… We're going to find out who is going after our federal agents. So when you look at Chicago, they've had probably 50 murders in the last six or seven months, eight months. Many, many people shot, like 30, 40, 50 people shot. Didn't die, but they've been shot. It's like a war zone. And then I listened to the governor and the mayor get up and say how they have it under control. They don't. It's probably worse than almost any city in the world. You can go to Afghanistan, you can go to a lot of different places, and they probably marvel at how much crime we have. Then you go to Memphis where we are right now. Now, just like in Washington… Washington D.C., right now, you people know better than I do because you have to live right inside, and so many of the press have come to me, they've said, \"I can't believe it. It's changed so much.\"\n\n(14:13)We have a safe city in Washington. Memphis will very soon have a safe city. Chicago can be very, very safe. It's going to be very safe, but Chicago is going to be very safe. And you say, \"Why is it that a governor wouldn't accept free help?\" From regardless, whether it's National Guard or the military or anybody if women raped and beaten and knocked to hell and the same with men where they're being shot all over the place in large numbers. We had a week in Chicago where 11 people were murdered and 38 people were shot. And then we have a governor get up and say, \"Oh, it's safe. We can handle it.\" He can't handle it. He's an incompetent guy. That's why they threw him out of the family business. They threw him out. I knew the family business very well and they threw him out and now he's the governor. And he should say, \"We'd love to have a safer place.\"\n\n(15:06)Chicago is a great city potentially. I told you, the head of the Union Pacific Railroad said, \"Sir, save Chicago. It's a great city. It's going to be lost if you don't do it.\" We have no choice but to do this. And when judges give us rulings that you don't have to do it… Portland is on fire. Portland has been on fire for years and not so much saving it. We have to save something else because I think that's all insurrection. I really think that's really criminal insurrection. So I appreciate the question. These are unsafe places. We're going to make them safe. So you see what's going on in Memphis, not pretty, but you know what? We're doing a pretty job because it's going to be a very safe place in a little while. And the people of Memphis are so happy that we're there.\n\n(15:51)And the people of Chicago, so you have Black women with MAGA hats on in Chicago all over the place, they want the guard to come in. Or they don't care who comes in, they just want to be safe, and they really don't care. There was one woman, she was great today, she said, \"You know what? I don't care if it's a national guard, the Army, the Marines, the Air Force, I don't care who comes in as long as we're safe.\" And that's the way most of the public feels. We're going to make Chicago really great again and we're going to stop this crime. Then we're going to go to another one and we're going to go city by city. We're going to have safe cities.\n\n(16:31)And it was so great that we started with our nation's capital. One of the worst… So many people, every week somebody was killed. They'd come from Iowa, they'd come from Indiana, they want to see the Jefferson Memorial, the Lincoln Memorial, they want to see something and they'd get shot. And you'd call their parents, \"I'm sorry, but your son is dead.\" And they go, \"What do you mean he's dead?\" Came to Washington, D.C. Not anymore. That's not happening anymore. We have a safe place. We have a safe capital. It's as safe as we have, probably almost just about, in the country. And if you look back six months ago, seven months ago, this was a death trap. You look back during the Biden, what they did, how badly they managed things. And almost all of these cities, most of these cities are Democrat run. And we don't care, Democrat, Republican, we're going to make them safe. So we have to save Chicago. It's very important. And you can't have a governor getting up and saying it's good. When 11 people were shot over a weekend.\n\nPress Corps (17:35):\n\n[inaudible 00:17:36].\n\nSpeaker 5 (17:35):\n\nUnder what condition… Mr. President, the Insurrection Act, under what conditions or terms would you [inaudible 00:17:41]?\n\nDonald Trump (17:40):\n\nWell, I'd do it if it was necessary. So far it hasn't been necessary, but we have an insurrection act for a reason. If I had to enact it, I'd do that. If people were being killed and courts were holding us up or governors or mayors were holding us up, sure I'd do that. I want to make sure that people aren't killed. We have to make sure that our cities are safe. And it's turning out. And we started with D.C., it's been so successful. Think of it, people wouldn't go to restaurants, the restaurants were closing. We're losing a lot of restaurants, as you all know. And now restaurants are opening and they're thriving. And I went two weeks ago and it was great. I'm going to go again. I felt very safe. Very safe. Forgetting about guards and Secret Service, I would've gone. It would've been very safe.\n\n(18:28)D.C. is a great… And look at the cleanliness of D.C. Look at how it's clean. You don't have tents all over the place. We had parks where you couldn't even walk through the park. You had people from tents and they were violent people. Some of these people were violent people. We have a great safe capital again, and if you look at it in six months from now, it'll be the most beautiful anywhere in the world. It's being cleaned. The graffiti is all gone now. The tents are all gone. We have a capital that you can be proud of, but it'll only get better with time.\n\nPress Corps (19:03):\n\nMr. President.\n\nSpeaker 8 (19:04):\n\nTomorrow is October 7th, the two-year anniversary of the original Israeli attack. Do you expect a Gaza deal tomorrow or is there any sort of hostage [inaudible 00:19:13]?\n\nDonald Trump (19:13):\n\nI think we're going to have it soon. I think we're going to have a deal. Look, it's a hard thing for me to say that when for years and years they've been trying to have a deal with Gaza. But literally for centuries, if you really think about it. But we're going to have a Gaza deal, I'm pretty sure, yeah.\n\nSpeaker 8 (19:31):\n\nAnd what can you tell us about the talks?\n\nDonald Trump (19:34):\n\nWell, I'm the one that got the hostages back. Remember that. I'm the one that-\n\nSpeaker 6 (19:36):\n\nI was going to ask you that.\n\nDonald Trump (19:38):\n\nYeah, I got them back.\n\nSpeaker 6 (19:40):\n\nIsraeli citizens are celebrating what you've accomplished in this deal. Should it come through, there will be a lot of celebration on the streets of Israel. The hostages' families, have they been in contact with you with regard to this deal that could happen?\n\nDonald Trump (19:55):\n\nYeah, they're so happy about it they can't breathe. One said, \"I can't breathe.\" It's very sad because you have hostages and you have people that are no longer living. And I've said this to you many times, the parents want the bodies of their boy back, the bodies of their loved one back. In most cases, they're young men and they're dead. And there's probably 32 or so, about that number, nobody knows exactly what the number is. They want that body back as much as if their son were alive. And I've been with them. Many have come to the White House, to the Oval Office. I've been with many of the people that I got released. We have a fantastic group working on it. Steve Witkoff has been amazing. Jared, I have Jared. I took Jared out because Jared is a very… You don't find anybody more capable, and we have the A-plus team working on it. I think we've made tremendous progress.\n\n(20:59)And the people of Israel want it to happen. But the people related to hostages, you see in Israel, tens of thousands of people. They really want the hostages back and they really want things to end. And I think Hamas now has been… All I can say is they've been fine. They've been fine. I hope it's going to continue that way. I think it will. I really think we're going to have a deal. We have a really good chance of making a deal and it'll be a lasting deal. We want to have peace. This is beyond Gaza. Gaza is a big deal, but this is really peace in the Middle East. And the amazing thing is we have every Arab country, every Muslim country, we have every country surrounding, they all want…\n\n(21:45)I spoke with President Erdogan of Turkey. He's fantastic. He's been pushing very hard. He is a very powerful guy, and he's been pushing very, very hard to get this deal done. And Hamas has a lot of respect for him. They have a lot of respect for Qatar. They have a lot of respect for UAE and Saudi Arabia. Everybody is on our side to get this deal done. There's never been anything like it. Nobody's ever seen it. There's always been like 80% of them don't want something done. I think virtually we even had a very strong signal, as you know, from Iran. They'd like to see this done.\n\nPress Corps (22:22):\n\nMr. President. Mr. President.\n\nDonald Trump (22:22):\n\nYes.\n\nSpeaker 5 (22:23):\n\nMr. President, Governor Abbott offered up the Texas National Guard to you.\n\nDonald Trump (22:30):\n\nThat's good.\n\nSpeaker 5 (22:31):\n\nHave you had any other conversations with other red state governors?\n\nDonald Trump (22:35):\n\nYeah, I have. Every one of them is willing to offer whatever we need. We thank Governor Abbott of Texas. Every one of the, as you call them, red state Governors, is willing to give whatever we need, because they want our agents protected. These ICE agents have a tough job. They have to go in and get, in many cases, stone-cold criminals, hardened criminals, long-time criminals, and every, essentially Republican governor has offered up whatever we need. And some Democratic governors also. Daniel.\n\nDaniel (23:08):\n\nMr. President, thank you. A quick question on the subject of the order, the Biden administration previously speaking, they shut down Alaska for business. You have reversed that. You reversed it on day one. You opened it up going after all the critical minerals. This mission of yours, Secretary Burgum, Secretary Wright, to boost our own independent production of critical minerals, rare earth-\n\nDonald Trump (23:29):\n\nWell, it's necessary, right?\n\nDaniel (23:31):\n\nCan you just talk about how important that is over the next four years, sir?\n\nDonald Trump (23:35):\n\nWell, it's very necessary. In the past, we were able to go to other countries, buy whatever we want. But all of a sudden, if those countries are hostile… And by the way, China hasn't been, we've made deals with China. They approved the TikTok deal. Everyone said, \"You'd never get the TikTok deal approved.\" They approved it and we have great people buying it. Big, strong American companies are buying it, the most prestigious companies there are, actually. And they're going to make sure everything's\n\nDonald Trump (24:00):\n\n… was good, but President Xi was great. He approved it. So I'm not saying hostile, but it's good to have our own minerals. And we create a tremendous value by creating a road. We build a road that only we can do because we have the rights to do it, number one, and we have the power to do it. And so we build a road that's over 200 miles long through a very beautiful area of the world. Actually, it's incredible. When you look at it, it's incredible. But a rough area from the standpoint of building. So we get a road done, and with that, we unleash billions and billions of dollars of wealth. It's pretty amazing when you think of it. And it's wealth that we need, if we're going to be the number one country.\n\n(24:40)We're number one now with AI, you probably read. We're beating everybody with AI at levels that nobody ever thought even possible. And one of the reasons we are is because of energy. So our grid is old and tired, like most grids are. They get old with time. I mean, the older you are, the older the grid gets, right? But I've allowed the people building AI or other plants, other types of plants, but AI in particular, because they need so much electricity, I've allowed them to build their own power. And it's been amazing. They're building massive plants and with the plant, they're building their own electricity. They've become a utility in a sense. I said, maybe you'll do better with the utility than you do with the AI. I don't know. But we're letting them build their own electricity. So we don't have to worry about the grid. We don't have to worry about anything. And they're going to build it in such a way that if they have excess capacity, they're going to put it back into the grid. It's pretty amazing.\n\n(25:38)So when they build, we're giving them permits to build their own electric power plants. And it's incredible when you see what they're doing. And because of that and other things that we're doing, we're leading every country. Nobody's even close to us with AI. And AI seems to be the big thing. I don't know, I can't tell you that. There are a lot of people building and a lot of people have high stock prices because of AI. So a lot of people think it's great stuff, and I think it's great stuff. I look at it, it's amazing what it can do. In terms of medical, in terms of medical costs, in terms of knowledge, it's basically information and information at a level that nobody thought possible before. So we'll see.\n\n(26:21)But they're building plants where you saw the one overlay that I did where, in this case it's Meta, one of their plants is essentially the size, almost the size of Manhattan. And that's a building. It's a building that covers Manhattan. So it's big stuff. And nobody's even close to us. We're leading AI by so much.\n\nJournalists (26:42):\n\nMr. President, on the Supreme [inaudible 00:26:46]-\n\n(26:46)Mr. President, [inaudible 00:26:46]-\n\nDonald Trump (26:46):\n\nYeah, go ahead, please.\n\nJournalists (26:46):\n\n… since the start of your administration we've seen a lot more Americans wanting to join ICE. And as we are seeing more attacks on them right now, what's your message to rank and file ICE agents who are trying to do their jobs but are facing a thousand percent increase in attacks?\n\nDonald Trump (26:58):\n\nI love your questions. I like you. So who are you with?\n\nJournalists (27:01):\n\nI'm with NTV.\n\nDonald Trump (27:02):\n\nVery good.\n\nJournalists (27:02):\n\nI was the one who got mugged.\n\nDonald Trump (27:04):\n\nYou were the one, that's what I thought. You got mugged. You're not getting mugged anymore.\n\nJournalists (27:07):\n\nNot anymore.\n\nDonald Trump (27:08):\n\nShe was really… You're lucky to be with us with that deal that happened. I know all about that. Not anymore though. You feel a different world out there, right?\n\nJournalists (27:17):\n\nTotally. I feel safe with the baby nowadays [inaudible 00:27:19]-\n\nDonald Trump (27:19):\n\nOh, good. Well, you're safe now. Nobody is going to be hurting you in any way.\n\nJournalists (27:24):\n\nThank you, Mr. President.\n\nDonald Trump (27:24):\n\nOkay. Thank you very much.\n\nJournalists (27:25):\n\nMr. President, on the Supreme Court today-\n\nDonald Trump (27:26):\n\nThank you. So the bottom line on your question, we're just going to make things real safe. We're going to make… We're going to have a country that you could be proud of. Not a country that you read about every day where somebody gets mugged from behind or hit over the head with a baseball bat. Those people aren't with us any longer. Yeah, please.\n\nJournalists (27:43):\n\nMr. President, yes.\n\nDonald Trump (27:43):\n\nThank you very much.\n\nJournalists (27:44):\n\nThank you, Mr. President. On today's call with Lula from Brazil, are you considering lowering tariffs after the call? [inaudible 00:27:51]-\n\nDonald Trump (27:51):\n\nWell, I had a great talk with the president of Brazil, who's a good man. I met him actually at the United Nations. I was going up to make a speech and I didn't have a teleprompter. I was walking up to my teleprompter. I said, \"I don't have a teleprompter.\" But just before that, I met with President Lula and I found him to be very good. I mean, we had a very good talk for about two minutes, and then I went up to make a speech and I was surprised to see… How would you like that one, Doug? I've got every leader in the world sitting out there. My teleprompter isn't on. You know why, Daniel? Because it was a rigged deal. But fortunately I made a better speech than I would've if I read it off a teleprompter, which is pretty easy to do. So it was quite a day. That was a big day. But we met and we liked each other, and yeah, we had a great conversation. Yeah, we'll start doing business.\n\nJournalists (28:42):\n\nAnd are you considering traveling to Brazil for a [inaudible 00:28:46]?\n\nDonald Trump (28:47):\n\nAt some point, I would. And he's going to come here. We talked about that.\n\nJournalists (28:49):\n\nAnd a follow-up question on Israel. Israel government has been arresting and reporting activists that were traveling to Gaza. Today, Greta Thunberg, for instance, also some-\n\nDonald Trump (29:00):\n\nWell, she's just a troublemaker. I mean, you mean she's no longer into the environment now, she's at this. She's a troublemaker. She has an anger management problem. I think she should see a doctor. She needs anger… If you ever watched her. She's a young person, she's so angry, she's so crazy. Now you can have her. You can have her. She's just a troublemaker. Yeah, please.\n\nJournalists (29:24):\n\nThe Supreme Court is back in its term today, Mr. President, and they-\n\nDonald Trump (29:24):\n\nSay it.\n\nJournalists (29:25):\n\nThe Supreme Court is back in session, they rejected today, I know, appeal by Ghislaine Maxwell to overturn her conviction. That means her only chance of getting out of prison is a pardon from you. Is that something you're open to doing?\n\nDonald Trump (29:34):\n\nWho are we talking about?\n\nJournalists (29:35):\n\nGhislaine Maxwell.\n\nDonald Trump (29:38):\n\nI haven't heard the name in so long. I can say this, that I'd have to take a look at it. I would have to take a look. Did they reject that?\n\nJournalists (29:45):\n\nShe wanted to appeal her conviction.\n\nDonald Trump (29:47):\n\nAnd what happened?\n\nJournalists (29:47):\n\nAnd they said that they were not going to hear her appeal.\n\nDonald Trump (29:50):\n\nI see. Well, I'll take a look at it. I'll speak to…\n\nJournalists (29:51):\n\nBut you're considering that?\n\nDonald Trump (29:52):\n\nI will speak to the DOJ. I wouldn't consider it or not consider it. I don't know anything about it, but I'll speak-\n\nJournalists (29:57):\n\nWhy would she be a candidate?\n\nDonald Trump (29:57):\n\nI will speak to the DOJ.\n\nJournalists (29:58):\n\nWhy would she be a candidate for clemency, Sir?\n\nDonald Trump (30:01):\n\nI don't know. I mean, I'd have to speak to the DOJ. I'll look at it. I have a lot of people have asked me for pardons. I call him Puff Daddy, has asked me for a pardon.\n\nJournalists (30:11):\n\nBut she was convicted of child sex trafficking.\n\nDonald Trump (30:14):\n\nYeah, I mean, I'm going to have to take a look at it. I'd have to ask DOJ. I didn't know they rejected it. I didn't know she was even asking for it, frankly.\n\nJournalists (30:23):\n\n[inaudible 00:30:23] supply Tomahawk missiles to Ukraine or selling to NATO and let them sell them to Ukraine?\n\nDonald Trump (30:28):\n\nYeah, I've sort of made a decision pretty much.\n\nJournalists (30:31):\n\nCould you share it with us, Sir?\n\nDonald Trump (30:32):\n\nIf you consider… Yeah, I think I want to find out what they're doing with them. Where are they sending them, I guess? I'd have to ask that question. That war should never have started. Would've never started. Such bad judgment was used there, I think on both sides, by the way. But nobody looks good with the war with Russia and Ukraine. Nobody.\n\nJournalists (30:54):\n\nI know, Sir.\n\nDonald Trump (30:55):\n\nIt's been a horrible… This week they lost over 7,000 soldiers between the two of them.\n\nJournalists (31:02):\n\nAnd those missiles-\n\nDonald Trump (31:02):\n\nThis is every week, they're losing 7,000, 8,000, 5,000.\n\nJournalists (31:06):\n\n… they have a range of like 1500 miles or something, and so they'd be able to [inaudible 00:31:10]-\n\nDonald Trump (31:10):\n\nNo, I know. I would ask some questions. I want to see what's…\n\nJournalists (31:14):\n\nMr. President-\n\nDonald Trump (31:17):\n\nI'm not looking to see escalation.\n\nJournalists (31:19):\n\nYes. And tomorrow you're meeting with the Canadian prime minister. What's on the agenda for that, Mr. President?\n\nDonald Trump (31:24):\n\nWell, I guess he's going to ask about tariffs. Because a lot of companies from Canada are moving into the United States. Everybody's moving back into the US, and he's probably going to be asking about tariffs. They're losing a lot of companies in Canada. They're coming into the… They left here. They left here 20 years ago when presidents that sat right at this desk weren't doing their job properly. They were probably good politicians, but they weren't good at business and they allowed these companies to leave. And all they had to do is do what I'm doing right now.\n\n(31:58)And I'm not saying it's the easiest thing to do, but it is, it's effective. We're a rich country again, we're a powerful country, because I've ended seven wars, at least half of them was because of my ability at trade and because of tariffs. If I didn't have tariffs to throw around a little bit, you would have at least four wars raging right now with thousands of people a day being killed. That aren't happening, we've settled. We settled seven. We're getting close to settling eight. That would be a big one. And that's something that could happen.\n\n(32:33)So I think he's coming probably to talk about tariffs because a lot of companies are leaving Canada to come into the US. And they're leaving Mexico. And by the way, they're leaving China. They're leaving all over the world to come into the US. Nobody's actually seen anything like it.\n\nJournalists (32:50):\n\nWould you shift your position on tariffs in response to whatever you speak about?\n\nDonald Trump (32:54):\n\nWell, I mean, look, my position's turned out to… Everybody said I'm right. They find billions of dollars that they didn't even know they had. Recently, they said they found billions of dollars and they couldn't understand. I said, \"Check the tariff shelf.\" And they come in the next hour and they said, \"Sir, you're right. It was from the tariffs.\" We're a rich, really rich country again. But more importantly, maybe influence. If I didn't have the power of tariffs, you would have at least four of the seven wars raging. I use tariffs to stop wars. If you look at India and Pakistan, they were ready to go at it. Seven planes were shot down. They were ready to go at it. And they're nuclear powers, and I don't want to say exactly what I said, but what I said was very effective. They stopped. And that was based on tariffs. It was based on trade.\n\n(33:48)Tariffs are very important for the United States. We are a peacekeeper because of tariffs. Not only do we make hundreds of billions of dollars, but we're a peacekeeper because of tariffs.\n\nJournalists (34:00):\n\nMr. President-\n\n(34:01)Mr. President-\n\n(34:02)On the shutdown, Mr. President. The shutdown that occurred during your first term lasted 35 days, how long do you expect this shutdown to go?\n\nDonald Trump (34:10):\n\nWell, you don't know. Look, I can say this, that it would've not happened except for the Democrats. The Democrats are very foolish. They've lost their way. And we have a new thing now, when you look at, it's called crime, it's called absolute… As Biden would say, well, I won't say what he would've said. Remember when he said, \"It's a three-letter word, no\"? Remember that one? We would say, what was that all about? He probably meant exclamation point or something after the word. But this is a five-letter word, crime, C-R-I-M-E. And we want to put it out and are putting it out. And they don't seem to care about it, but they do care.\n\n(34:51)I believe that Pritzker and this mayor of Chicago that like to say about we have it under… They don't have it under control. Not only is it not under control, it's the opposite. And I believe they're afraid. They're scared for their lives. I believe that the Portland people are scared. You look at what's happened with Portland over the years, it's a burning hellhole. And then you have a judge that lost her way, that tries to pretend that like there's no problem.\n\nJournalists (35:23):\n\nYou appointed that judge, Mr. President.\n\nDonald Trump (35:24):\n\nActually, she's not even saying that. There's a huge problem in Portland. I'll tell you what the problem is, crime. Okay? Crime. And it's a huge problem in Chicago, it's called crime. And we want to put out the crime and they want to inflame the crime. And why they want to, I don't know. But it could be that Pritzker is scared for his life. Yeah.\n\nJournalists (35:44):\n\nYou appointed that judge in Portland, Mr. President.\n\n(35:45)Mr. President, on the UN, do you have an update on the investigation into what happened to you at the UN last month? And also what's your message to Americans who are concerned about your and your family's safety, as you're very out in public [inaudible 00:35:57]-\n\nDonald Trump (35:55):\n\nYeah, I am out there. There's no question about it. Well, at the UN, we\n\nDonald Trump (36:00):\n\nAnd we had a problem with the teleprompter. We had another problem that nobody has actually talked about, the people in the room didn't hear my speech. Did you know that? The people in the room, they didn't have any loudspeakers and they didn't hear my speech, and I thought I made a really good speech. Considering I didn't have the use of a teleprompter, which is unusual, but I made a speech.\n\n(36:24)I could have walked off the stage. Doug, I think most people would've just said, \"We'll see you in about a half an hour.\" Right? But they obviously turned off the tele… I think they turned off the teleprompter, but there was a reason that it didn't work. I actually know the reason. They didn't let the teleprompter person into the room, which is essentially the same thing.\n\n(36:46)So I made a speech, it turned out to be a very good speech, got good reviews. I went out to the audience after the speech, I saw my wife. I said, \"How good was that speech? Was that unbelievable or what?\" She said, \" I didn't hear a word you said.\" I said, \"What do you mean?\" She was sitting in the front. I said, \"What do you mean?\" She said, \"You couldn't hear anything that you said. The speakers were turned off.\"\n\n(37:09)So, I think that's pretty bad stuff, right? Especially since we support most of the United Nations. And yet, I still want to keep it in New York, 'cause I think the United Nations has tremendous potential. If properly run, the United States has tremendous potential.\n\n(37:26)But think of this, I settled seven wars. I never spoke to the United Nations about it. Not one of them. And those were wars that were raging a long time in many cases. And I settled seven, I never heard from the United… They didn't help me. They should be able to settle the wars. I shouldn't have to be settling the wars. Yeah, please.\n\nSpeaker 9 (37:46):\n\nLast week you signed the security guarantees for Qatar. Do you see any role for the Senate in that they have to vote on that, or do you think [inaudible 00:37:55]?\n\nDonald Trump (37:54):\n\nWell, I wouldn't mind if they did. If they want to, they'd let me know. Nobody said that but, Qatar has been very, very helpful to us in this process, and I think you'll find that. I think maybe the most influential, they're very influential, very strong. With Hamas, they're very strong. And Turkey has likewise been helpful.\n\n(38:17)Honestly, UAE, Saudi Arabia, everybody has been helpful. I just spoke today with the king of Jordan and he's been terrific, too. I can't think of any countries that's been negative about this. This is why it should happen. Everybody wants it to happen, including, I think, Hamas. And when they want it to happen, it's going to happen.\n\nSpeaker 10 (38:44):\n\nJames Comey is being arraigned on Wednesday, obviously after his indictment. Are you worried that your own statements calling for his prosecution could help him actually in his defense of this case?\n\nDonald Trump (38:54):\n\nNo, I think he's a crooked guy. He's a dirty cop, Comey. I think he's a dirty cop. He's a recognized by many people to be a dirty cop and a dishonest guy, so all I have to do is… I mean, I have nothing to do with the case, I just say, \"Good luck.\"\n\nSpeaker 10 (39:11):\n\nBut you called on Pam Bondi to prosecute him and opposed to him on Truth Social.\n\nDonald Trump (39:13):\n\nNo, no, I don't call anybody. You know what? I'm allowed to do that if I wanted to do that, but Comey's a crooked guy. He has been for years and he got caught. Look, he lied. This is just a simple case. He totally lied. And then he confirmed the lie on, I guess, numerous occasions, or at least one occasion he confirmed the lie. He said, 'That's what I said, and I stand by it.\"\n\n(39:34)And the guy, he didn't say, \"To the best of my knowledge,\" he didn't say, \"Well, I don't remember\" he made a very definitive statement and a very important statement concerning him, and he got caught in an outright lie. And that's why a group of people, it wasn't me that voted, they voted to indict him, but he's a crooked guy in my opinion. And we'll find out. The court's going to determine that in a little while, I guess.\n\nSpeaker 10 (40:02):\n\nMr. President, do you expect to announce farm relief this week?\n\nDonald Trump (40:03):\n\nYeah, I going to do some farm stuff this weekend. Yeah, please?\n\nDaniel (40:07):\n\n[inaudible 00:40:08] the Navy yesterday celebrating-\n\nDonald Trump (40:09):\n\nIt was unbelievable.\n\nDaniel (40:11):\n\n… their 250th. Can you talk about that, and as we get closer to America's 250th, you've initiated a prayer initiative as well?\n\nDonald Trump (40:18):\n\nYeah.\n\nDaniel (40:19):\n\nTalk to me about both of those events and why they're so important, particularly the prayer initiative going forward to the celebration of America.\n\nDonald Trump (40:25):\n\nWell, we have and we're dealing, as you know, with all of the different, and not just evangelicals, Christians, we're dealing with lots of different faiths, religions. And I felt for a long time that if a country doesn't have religion, doesn't have faith, doesn't have God, it's going to be very hard to be a good country. There's no reason to be good. I want to be good 'cause you want to prove to God that you're good, so you go to that next step, right?\n\n(40:52)So, that's very important to me. I think it's really very important. And yesterday was amazing. We went out, we went to the naval base, the largest in the world, actually. And I saw things that were incredible. The level of just, I don't want to use the word weapons, but they are weapons. The technology on these planes or the carriers and all of the different things that we saw. They gave us missile displays, they did the whole… I don't think they've ever done anything like it, but it was really impressive.\n\n(41:21)And the talent of the pilots where they can land. The aircraft carriers look massive, but when you put them in the middle of the Atlantic, or in this case, pretty far off the coast of Virginia, and it's sitting in a big ocean. And it was pretty calm yesterday, but it's still a little bit testy. And you'd have these guys land right on a thing and come to a sudden screeching halt, and they're really something.\n\n(41:49)They were taking off yesterday and they look over, \"Yes, sir,\" and then you see them just get ripped back into the seat 'cause the G-forces are so great. And actually, if you're not in great shape, 'cause they were doing maneuvers that were incredible yesterday, and the admirals were explaining that if you're not in really good shape, you don't make it because you pass out.\n\n(42:14)These guys and women, I met some women pilots that it's incredible what they're able to do. So we saw something that was great, and you saw the spirit 'cause we had for a couple of thousand. I think they had probably 20, 22,000 largely sailors all dressed in the most beautiful white. There wasn't a spot on any of those uniforms. I looked at them, it was just a wave of white, and it was a great crowd and great reception.\n\n(42:42)So, getting back to a very important question that was asked, when you go back a year ago, people weren't joining the armed forces. They weren't joining the Army, Navy, Air Force, Marines, the Coast Guard, Air Force. If you look at any of them, they weren't joining, the Space Force. And now, we're setting records, recruitment, and that goes for the police and fire. Now they want to be policemen, they want to be firemen.\n\n(43:12)And firemen, people don't mention them, but they're incredible there. I know so many of them. They're brave as hell. I wouldn't want to do it, tell you. But they weren't able to recruit. The police weren't able to recruit and the military wasn't able to recruit. We were really off. And I got elected, and it really started on November 5th, I got elected and somehow the country developed a spirit. Financially, yes, but also with the military.\n\n(43:37)And now we have record levels of people wanting to be in. Every force is filled. We have waiting lists to get into the Marines, to the Army, to the Navy, to the Air Force. We have Coast Guard. We have waiting lists to get in. It's amazing actually what's happened. We have a country, it was a dead country. And I say it all the time, we had a dead country one year ago. Now, we have the hottest country anywhere in the world. And it's nice to see you. I've watched you for years on television, so it's nice to meet you. Thank you very much, everybody.\n\nSpeaker 11 (44:06):\n\nThank you, press. Thank you, press. Let's go. Thanks guys.\n\nSpeaker 12 (44:09):\n\nThank you guys.\n\nSpeaker 11 (44:10):\n\nThanks guys. Let's go. Let's go. Let's head out.\n\nSpeaker 12 (44:13):\n\nThank you guys.\n\nSpeaker 11 (44:13):\n\nThanks guys.\n\nSpeaker 12 (44:14):\n\nThanks guys.\n\nSpeaker 11 (44:14):\n\nThank you.\n\nDonald Trump (44:14):\n\nThank you very much. Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 13 (44:14):\n\nThank you, Kate.\n\nSpeaker 11 (44:14):\n\nThank you guys.\n\nSpeaker 12 (44:21):\n\nKeep moving guys. Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 11 (44:22):\n\nThank you guys.\n\nSpeaker 14 (44:22):\n\nThank you, sir. Thank you.\n\nDonald Trump (44:22):\n\nDoing all right?\n\nSpeaker 14 (44:22):\n\nDoing good.\n\nDonald Trump (44:22):\n\nYou look younger than you did 10 years ago.\n\nSpeaker 14 (44:27):\n\nThank you.\n\nDonald Trump (44:27):\n\nNot bad.\n\nSpeaker 14 (44:27):\n\nI'm working on it.\n\nDonald Trump (44:27):\n\nLet me know your secret.\n\nSpeaker 10 (44:27):\n\nThank you, Mr President.\n\nDonald Trump (44:27):\n\nThank you for your questions.\n\nDaniel (44:27):\n\n[inaudible 00:44:38].\n\nDonald Trump (44:27):\n\nBye, Daniel. [inaudible 00:44:38], Daniel. [inaudible 00:44:40].\n\nDaniel (44:27):\n\nIt was huge.\n\nDonald Trump (44:42):\n\n[inaudible 00:44:36], you know why?

    "date": "",
    "transcript": "Donald Trump (00:00):\n\nThen other countries for the exact same product. A major reason is that the American consumers have been subsidizing research and development costs for the entire planet. They put all of that on us, and yet they were the beneficiaries too. So it's being changed as of today. The United States had just 4% of the world's population and consumers, only 13% of all prescription drugs, yet pharmaceutical companies make 75% of their profits from the United States. So think of that. We have 4% of the market, 13% of prescription drugs. And yet Albert, I didn't know you were that violent. I'm surprised you're agreeing to this.\n\nAlbert Bourla (00:40):\n\nI'm getting better.\n\nDonald Trump (00:43):\n\nCome here. No, he's doing the right thing. Thank you. And yet they make 75% of their profits from the American customers. It's something. That's why I signed an executive order combating this practice and we signed it very happily a little while ago. Today, Pfizer is committing, as will other drug companies as we go through the weeks, but Pfizer is truly one of the biggest in the world and one of the greatest in the world. Today, Pfizer is committing to offer all of their prescription medications to Medicaid, and it will be at the most favored nation's prices. It's going to have a huge impact on bringing Medicaid costs down like nothing else. I told you that in my first term, I was so proud of the fact that for the first time in 28 years, drug prices came down and I had a news conference that I explained. It was 1/10 of 1%, but it was down. And here we're talking about in one case over 1,000%.\n\n(01:42)This is a critical step forward to our work and to improve healthcare of hard working low-income Americans, especially low-income Americans, will be helped so greatly. In addition, Pfizer is agreeing to provide some of their most popular current medications to all consumers at heavily discounted prices of anywhere between 50 and 100%, and that's off the price. And in some cases even more than that. These drugs will be available for direct purchase online at a website operated by the federal government. We're also announcing that moving forward, all new medications introduced by Pfizer to the American market will be sold at the reduced most favored nation costs. So we'll be paying essentially what other countries are paying who have been much lower, much, much lower for many, many years.\n\n(02:31)Furthermore, Pfizer will invest $70 billion to reshore domestic manufacturing facilities. In other words, they're going to bring a lot of their facilities to make their drugs and make what they make, their product, they're going to make it in the United States. I appreciate that. $70 billion investment and fund research and development right here in America. We're working with other major pharmaceutical companies to secure similar agreements. Everyone understands that the status quo where Americans pay more for drugs, prescription drugs, and they pay more than foreign countries who take advantage of us in many other ways, although not so many anymore. I think we've pretty well got that stopped, right? I think so. We've stopped that, but they took advantage of a lot of other presidents, that I can tell you.\n\n(03:18)But we're making this pay to be very unacceptable what they've done in the past. That's why my administration has also taken historic action to investigate the unfair and discriminatory trade practices of other countries that extort our pharmaceutical makers to shift costs onto the American consumer. They say, \"No, give us a price, a very low price and just charge the American consumer. Charge it to the U.S.\" The United States is done subsidizing the healthcare of the rest of the world. It's a big thing. I can't tell you how big this is, and I was all set to go on it first term, but then you had the COVID and we had a focus on that. But I said, I want to get back here. So because this is, you're talking about 14, 15, 1,600% reductions in some cases. But by taking this small step, we're ending the era of global price gouging at the expense of American families and we're making America healthy again, which is our little theme for the people behind me.\n\n(04:17)And I want to just ask Secretary Kennedy to come up and we'll start and we'll go through it with Oz and Klomp and Bourla and Makary. We'll go through it and if you have any questions, but this is a really big announcement. This is something that most people said was not doable and other countries are going along because we told them that if you don't go along, they didn't have to go along. But if they didn't go along, we were going to put extra tariffs on those countries and we were going to charge them the amount of money that they should be paying for the reduction in costs. So I think we had a pretty good negotiating position. So Bobby, I'd like you to speak about this and what a great job and thank you very much.\n\nRobert F. Kennedy Jr. (05:00):\n\nI'd like to thank a couple of people who aren't up here, Theo Merkel, Dr. Heidi Overton who played key roles in this negotiation and helped make this happen. And also Emma Hernandez, who's not up here, but John Brooke and Chris Klomp who were the people who were negotiating, in some cases, I think including last night, 24 hours without any sleep. This would not have happened without President Trump's leadership. I told my son last night, we're all under secrecy about this, but I told my son late last night, a 27-year old son Connor, who's a very liberal Democrat, and I told him this was happening and he just paused for a minute and he said, \"Thank you, dad. I'm so proud of you.\" Because this is something Democrats have wanted for 20 years. Republicans have wanted for 20 years. Everybody said they're going to do it. Nobody has even taken a step towards doing it.\n\n(06:04)And the reason was because it was such a daunting task. And even all of the negotiators you say, I also want to thank Howard Lutnick. This would not have happened without him. But even all of the negotiators here and all the people at HHS and at the White House team, all we could see was all the reasons that this couldn't happen. Everybody had tried, nobody could make it happen. And it was President Trump alone with his doggedness, his persistence his… He saw this clearly in a way that none of us are in its most simplest terms. Why are we spending more on this country than any other country? Why are we spending 75% of the revenues that come to the pharmaceutical industry? We're doing all the research and everybody else is riding on our slipstream. And President Trump, I would say harangued and harassed us to make this happen. I was getting calls at 11:30, 12:00 at night, \"Oh, are you asleep? You got to get MFN done.\" And at one point, Dr. Oz told me, \"I can't take the President's calls anymore. My wife has a lot of reasons say to me about different things that happened in my life and doesn't that give you anxiety?\" And I say, \"I don't get anxiety.\" \"This gave me anxiety.\" Oh, thank you President Trump. It would not have happened without you. This is real leadership. He's a president who has a vision and makes that vision happen. And I can't think of any other president of the United States who could have done this in our history. I'm very grateful to you. This is an extraordinary benefit to the American people.\n\n(08:02)Thank you for your vision, President Trump, you bold action, your unwavering commitment to health and well-being of the American people. Never has a president stood up so bravely for the American people with respect to healthcare. By the way, I forgot to thank Albert Bourla. Albert and I have had a long history of antipathy and antagonism toward each other, but I have to say his leadership in this took tremendous courage and he really created a template for corporate responsibility for putting public health ahead of his individual interests. I'm very, very grateful to you, Albert.\n\n(08:45)Under the leadership of President Trump, the U.S. is now acting as a tough negotiator on behalf of the American people. Today is about fairness. It's about equality. It's about giving hope to those who are trying to stay healthy or managing illness and/or fighting for their lives. We refuse to make the most vulnerable citizens continue to pay an unthinkable price for the world's pharmaceutical breakthroughs which we pay for. This policy is a shield for the chronically ill who have carried the burden of high drug costs for far too long. It's a signal to every American family that we're finally putting their health and financial security first.\n\n(09:26)And it sets a new standard, one that says, we won't write blank checks to the drug industry any longer. No family should ever be forced to choose between filling a prescription and putting food on the table. Americans should not be gouged paying 300 or 400 or 1,000% more than people in other countries for the exact same drug, many times manufactured in the same factory in New Jersey and sold in Great Britain for 1/10 the price that it's being sold for here. This week, and I was with some friends up in Martha's Vineyard and an old friend, one of my oldest friends, his wife and daughter have a chronic disease, and that chronic disease last year cost $150,000 to treat.\n\n(10:14)And the mother had to choose whether she was going to take that money and spend it on her or her daughter. She spent it on her daughter, so she had to make that choice. It's a choice that no mother should have to make. We did a roundtable recently on drug prices. One patient spent more than $180,000 on one drug, on cash in all of her savings, and worked three jobs to make ends meet. One almost quit her job and moved to Germany to get the drug cheaper. Some looked at getting the drug on unsafe secondary markets because they could not afford it through the legitimate markets.\n\n(10:53)Today, we begin to right that ship. For the mother trying to help a child get better, for a grandmother at the pharmacy counter, and for millions of Americans who want to restore their health, today is about another promise made by President Trump and another promise kept by President Trump to the American people. And it's only just the beginning. This is all thanks to your unwavering leadership, Mr. president.\n\nDonald Trump (11:19):\n\nThank you.\n\nRobert F. Kennedy Jr. (11:19):\n\nThank you.\n\nDonald Trump (11:21):\n\nThank you very much. Thank you very much.\n\nMehmet Oz (11:27):\n\nThere is a fine line between vision and hallucination. People have to follow you for it to be a vision. And President Trump, you made a lot of people follow you. An idea that most people thought was not possible even remotely. And when we have that shared vision, and I'll speak to some of the people who are involved in this process because it was incredible effort that gives me great pride to serving this administration. And the fact that it did not leak is also an issue of pride for us because these were tough, tough challenges. And Albert Bourla looks very calm up here and cat-like, but he's ferocious when you get him in a negotiating room. This is true for all the pharmaceutical companies that we are negotiating with.\n\n(12:06)And Secretary Kennedy, my son Oliver, who I told about this deal as we was walking over here, is a Republican. And you know what he said? \"Thank you for making us proud.\" Because it's not just a Democratic problem, it's a Republican problem. This has not happened before. And it took a crusader like President Trump with the support of Secretary Kennedy, Secretary Lutnick. I see the vice president's here as well. Just unwavering, dogged pursuit of change. And now I have to admit that I know the President has me on speed dial. And most of the time when he would call me as Secretary Kennedy alluded to, it was about MFN.\n\n(12:41)And he always had reasons why we needed to go faster and why people were being hurt today, because we're allowing the kinds of pricing that had been tolerated for so many decades in America. The time of the day didn't matter. The day of the week didn't matter. And that's how the President was functioning. This was such an important part of what he saw as his legacy, which is why it brings such pride to all of us up here and many others to deliver it. And the laser focus that the President had on this, which he shared with me the day that I was nominated, that he nominated me for this position and has reminded me frequently since, made it a top priority for us as well at CMS.\n\n(13:18)Now, to do this, you have to have tactics. Not just vision but tactics. And the first tactic the President shared was to introduce me to Albert Bourla. He took us to dinner with Secretary Kennedy and he argued, and he's a great deal-maker as you know, that if you're going to make a deal of this scope of this nature, you need trust. So the President lit the kindling, he got the embers going, but he needed us to nurture that beginning of a fire so they would blaze into what today we can announce as the grand deal, one of the greatest ever, certainly in the space of pharmaceuticals.\n\n(13:49)I gained to respect Albert, and I'll tell you why in particular. It was because he recognized the dangerous problems facing so many Americans, that they had to choose between taking medications prescribed by their doctor that could be lifesaving, or shopping at the grocery store, paying for their kids, a fundamentally important need that would be squeezed out because they couldn't compromise on drugs, or often worse, they'd compromise on the drugs. One-third of all prescriptions are not filled in the pharmacy because of this. We talked through the winter, we talked through the spring, we talked through the summer, and we got nowhere. We stalled. The industry is powerful. They're important. They have smart people. There's no reason for them to give the numbers that the President is articulating today.\n\n(14:32)And you see these numbers on the charts around this. These are massive wins for the American people. But the president in July demanded after the executive order that manufacturers make a firm commitment and the lower prices or else, and it sent shockwaves through the industry. It got the ball rolling again. Our talks with Albert heated up, but it wasn't until last week, if you want an inside story, it wasn't until last week that we made a major breakthrough and our hardworking team embarked on a remarkable\n\nMehmet Oz (15:00):\n\nStory that I think books will be written about 24/7 non-stop with industry, with Albert, with his great team at Pfizer and with this partnership we began to deal with the fundamental challenges we have, which is protecting medical advances for the future while at the same time, securing the prices Americans want today. We're going to continue to stimulate and strengthen innovation. That's what a great country does, and we are a great country with a great leader. We're going to protect the US hegemony in R&D. We dominate the planet in discovering cures for illnesses, all those orphan ailments, all those remarkable advances, they come from resource labs here with companies like Pfizer and other great ones in the pharmaceutical space. We're going to lead in the life sciences, we're going to lead in ideas and we're going to make sure that we do all that while we're being fair to the American people, especially our most vulnerable. We're going to finally deliver on the fair drug prices that President Trump has been speaking about for two terms.\n\n(15:51)We're going to celebrate this historic day. I predict this historic day in the medical field for generations to come. The heroic negotiators that I do feel compelled to mention is Secretary Kennedy kindly also mentioned their names. Some of them can't be in here because they're busy negotiating future deeds. Inma Hernandez Delso, John Brooks, who's a deputy administrator of mine. Theo Merkel, who is in the back and tall and hard to miss with DPC and Coria, insulin with the same group, did a spectacular job and Don Dempsey at OMB. Just wonderful human beings work tirelessly to get this done. We will be able to secure this first MFN deal and the president touched on this, but we have much more to come. You'll be hearing breaking news from the president for the rest of the fall, and Mr. President, these brilliant minds are here because of you.\n\n(16:38)Now, I don't want to just pay homage this. I want to actually speak this a little bit. The passion to protect the American people brings top-tier Americans into the government. We've created a powerful administration with the president's leadership and administration of winners. People get things done. They see the generational opportunity to fix the biggest problems our nation faces, and the person who led this negotiation, Chris Clump, embodies this seal. Now Chris Clump came to visit Secretary Kennedy and I the very first day we were looking for staff to try to bring in the government and neither of us really had an idea of how challenging this might be, and he came to the interview and we knew that he had built a business that was worth several hundred million dollars, and the secretary, very poker-faced as he tends to be looked at him and said, \"Are you willing to give it all up and move your family to Washington?\"\n\n(17:26)A young family, four young children, beautiful wife, \"Are you willing to come across the country and serve our nation, serve this president to ensure vital programs like Medicare, which he runs will keep our seniors healthy for years to come?\" He gave it all up like so many have in this administration, passionate to follow the president's lead and serve on the Secretary Kennedy, and for those of you at home who are watching, and I hope there are quite a few, I think this shows just how cool a place it is to work is in this government, and I take great pride in the hand the ball to Chris. Chris, tell the American people what they have won thanks to your passionate ability to deliver on President Trump's promise.\n\nChris Klomp (18:12):\n\nThank you Mr. President. You have enabled something that is recently as last night nearly everyone has said was impossible, and Secretary Kennedy and Administrator Oz, thank you for having trust in us as a negotiating team to drive this forward on behalf of the American people, it is an absolute honor and privilege, and Mr. Bourla to you and to the team at Pfizer, you have taken a step that I think few appreciate requires a level of courage to change something that for decades administrations have tried and there was no incentive rationally for you to do, and yet you've done it because you recognize the opportunity to align your economic interest with the social interest of the American people, And we are grateful. Today is historic as it's been discussed. This is a major win in the battle for affordable healthcare and affordable drugs. As the President said, on average, we pay nearly three times what the rest of the wealthy world pays for branded pharmaceuticals.\n\n(19:14)And yet we drive more than 50% of global R&D, 50% of revenues, nearly 70% of profits. It's unjust, it's morally unjust, and when this happens, we stifle innovation and we limit access for the most vulnerable people across the planet and in America who need these medications, and so the president directed us to make deals. That's what he does and it's what we do, and all great deals and this is a great deal, are rooted in principles, and this deal was rooted in the principle of fairness. Now, the president could have directed us to go to the poorest country on the planet and find the cheapest price for every single drug and bring that back to the United States and use the might of the government to insist that that's the price we pay, and that might've worked actually for just a little bit, but very quickly it would've utterly destroyed innovation in pharmaceuticals.\n\n(20:05)It would've destroyed American privacy in building life-saving medications. There are nearly 20,000 known diseases on the planet. We have treatments or cures for far fewer than 10% of them. So that would've been a bad strategy and it would've limited access to those who need those medications the most, but he didn't call for that. He didn't call for 50% lower than the lowest price on the planet. What he called for was fairness, and that's a powerful principle because we all grow up wanting to be on the right side of fair and it allowed us to do what has not been done before, which is to call on manufacturers and ask them to be fair and allows us to go to countries and ask them to pay their fair share in the battle against global disease, and that is the unlock for this great deal. Now, it's my privilege to talk just for a few minutes about the details of the deal.\n\n(20:54)First, let's start with the definition of MFN. What do we mean by that? This is not made up list prices that have often been quoted in prior administrations stuffed with fees and rebates. We're talking about we start at net prices after fees, after rebates, the prices people actually pay here, the prices people actually pay in other wealthy countries. We then index to a basket of countries, wealthy countries across the world, and we go drug by drug and we look for the lowest price, and that becomes the starting point for what an MFN price is in the United States, and then we've built this principles of fairness on five key pillars as we've talked about. Number one, as has been discussed, direct access for patients. At TrumpRx, which is a site soon to be launched, available often at full MFN and always at lower prices than currently available.\n\n(21:44)This is by passing middlemen, it increases transparency. In many instances, prices are 80% lower than they are today. No more Canadian detours to purchase drugs more inexpensively than our neighbor. You do it from home, you do it at a click. This is American ingenuity outsmarting the system. Number two, the president was very clear to us and directed us to ensure that we secure the lowest prices for the most vulnerable Americans, those who are served by Medicaid. So we focused there first. So Pfizer will be putting virtually all of its portfolio of drugs at MFN prices available to Medicaid in the near future. This safeguards the program. This ensures that this program lives as a lifeline without undue burden on the taxpayer for those who need it most, for our vulnerable Americans whom we are charged morally to care for. The third principle is about future proofing fairness.\n\n(22:34)This is the idea that Pfizer has committed as are other manufacturers, that they will not launch a new drug for commercial Medicare, Medicaid, or cash pay markets at a price that is higher than the other wealthy world. Now, they are free to price their drugs wherever they want. These are not price caps, these are not price controls. They can price however they'd like. We are simply asking them and they are committing not to undercut us in other countries. This is an essential principle. This allows us to retrain other countries to appropriately value innovation for their citizens, to appropriately understand what fair share means to contribute global R&D. This allows us not to compromise access for those who need it most and this is a powerful commitment. The fourth principles around shared savings as our commerce colleagues and as our US trade representative colleagues succeed in encouraging other countries to pay more for existing medications.\n\n(23:31)A portion of that will go to fund additional R&D, and a portion of that will repatriate back to the United States to offset prices, lower prices further for Americans on those existing drugs, and the fifth principle as discussed with hats off to Secretary Lutnick and Ambassador Jamison Greer from US trade is about Pfizer committing to onshore 100% of the value of all imports that currently imports to the United States, thus ensuring that we seal our great American resurgence. If you're watching this right now and you have been looking for evidence that this is a president who knows or cares about you, who is fighting for you, who is fighting for every American, this is exhibit A. This is not an empty promise. It's not platitudes, it's not lacking a plan. These are hard contracts with teeth lowering prices now that we will all feel.\n\n(24:25)These are the most significant historical, substantive, mathematically quantified price reductions in the history of our country in modern-day pharmaceuticals. I cannot thank you enough for leadership in enabling this to happen. It is an absolute pleasure. The President has showed us that the impossible can be achieved and that is what's happened today. God bless America. With that in mind, it is my absolute pleasure to introduce Albert Bourla, CEO of Pfizer.\n\nAlbert Borla (25:02):\n\nMr. President, what an honor to be here today in this office to announce a landmark agreement. I think it's an historic day.\n\nDonald Trump (25:12):\n\nIs this the coolest office? He has a beautiful office, but the oval is the coolest, right? What do you think?\n\nAlbert Borla (25:19):\n\nI think by far and I've seen other presidents offices, there's nothing like that.\n\nMehmet Oz (25:25):\n\nIt's good office.\n\nAlbert Borla (25:26):\n\nYeah, so it's an historic day because I think today we're turning the tide and we are reversing an unfair situation. For years, other rich nations refused to pay the first serve for the medical innovation, and as a result, Americans had to assume this proportional cost on their shoulders. This situation we all knew is not sustainable. This situation is a situation that many wanted to change but no one could. This is changing today with this agreement. In July, the president sent to me and other heads of pharmaceutical companies a letter, and over there, he articulated four specific requests. These requests, it was obvious to us, were designed to lower drug costs in the America in different ways, it's one of them and altogether holistically to have synergistic effect in the impact that that will have in the US health care costs and patients. With this deal that we signed today, we satisfied all four of president's requests, all four.\n\n(26:44)The big winner of this deal clearly will be the American pace. There is no doubt about it. They are the ones that will see significant impact in their ability to buy medicines, but I would argue that it is not the only winner. I think who else is a winner here, it is American innovation and American economy. In our industry, we had two major overhangs that have substantially reduced our valuations and create concerns for us in our ability to invest. We are addressing both of them right now and I will speak about them. The first one was the uncertainty of tariffs, because president is absolutely right, tariff is the most powerful tool to motivate behaviors, Mr. president and clearly motivated ours, all right?\n\n(27:41)So by this agreement that we did, we commit to onshore the production of our medicines that are consumed in the US and are made outside the US, and for that, we are ready to unleash our investment portfolio in this country, and the president graciously gave us a three-year grace period that we will not be subject to the 232 tariffs as long as of course we move the products here. That's one. The second overhang in our industry was this uncertainty, what will happen with the framework of pricing in the country? Because this uncertainty, it was what was holding people from investing in the pharmaceutical industry, which resulted in significant reduction of our multiples.\n\n(28:31)Actually, our multiples are at historical law. Well, now we have clarity about what is the framework for the US pricing. Read the letter of President Trump, read the four points and this is the framework and we will abide to that, and going forward, this is how things will be priced in the US and abroad. We are ready to invest as the president also mentioned, $70 billion in the next few years from Pfizer in manufacturing and research in America. I really think this is an historical moment because also I can put that behind us and focus on the things that I want to spend my time, cancer treatments, to bring better obesity medicines, to bring better vaccines, to bring things that people value, and thank you for allowing us to do that. I want to thank Secretary Kennedy.\n\n(29:27)I want to thank Secretary Lutnick. Your leadership helped us to pull that together. You are the mastermind of everything, and without the brilliant way that you designed the whole thing, we wouldn't be able to make it happen, but you were even more brilliant because you had someone in your team that he was the driving force behind everything, and I don't have words to thank you for your integrity and it is what you have said. We created trust from day one and that was the most important thing that allowed us to be able\n\nAlbert Borla (30:00):\n\n… very difficult negotiations. Of course, I also want to thank the U.S. trade representative, who is also heavily engaged, and he's probably the first trade representative that I have seen that cares about our industry, and cares to do something about unfair situations out there.\n\n(30:20)But more than anyone else. Mr. President, I want to thank you-\n\nDonald Trump (30:23):\n\nThank you very much.\n\nAlbert Borla (30:24):\n\n… for your leadership, and, frankly, for your friends.\n\nDonald Trump (30:28):\n\nThank you.\n\nAlbert Borla (30:28):\n\nThank you.\n\nDonald Trump (30:28):\n\nI will thank you very much. Great job. Great job.\n\nSpeaker 1 (30:34):\n\nThank you, Mr. President. The growth of drug spending, that is the increase in drug pricing, is the fastest and biggest increasing area of healthcare spending. So, today's announcement has incredible implications for healthcare spending in the United States, and today marks the beginning of the end of the great American rip-off.\n\n(31:02)And it also marks the beginning of the end of a great American tragedy, something I've seen as a physician at the bedside, patients getting spun up into a financial rage doing GoFundMe campaigns online, sending repeat reminders asking people to donate, getting their churches to pass the offering plate from pew to pew, Sunday after Sunday to try to get enough money to pay for a drug in the United States, a drug that's five or 10 times more expensive than the same drug in France or Germany or the UK.\n\n(31:40)People get spun up, and it's a tragedy. Having cancer is hard enough. Getting spun up into a financial rage in order to try to get the money to pay for treatment makes it so much harder.\n\n(31:54)37% of people who go through cancer care say in the end that the financial toxicity makes them want to avoid or delay care in the future. That is, they're done with it. They're done with the system. That's how toxic financial toxicity can be.\n\n(32:12)And for what? For what? So, the U.S. can finance the R&D of the world? Well, that ends today thanks to President Trump. So, we want to see R&D, we want to see American pharmaceutical companies thrive, we want to see pharmaceutical companies that do business, and manufacturers in the United States thrive.\n\n(32:35)At the FDA, we're doing our part. If you're going to equalize your price to that of other wealthy countries, we're not talking about Zimbabwe, we're talking about Germany, France, UK, Japan, other wealthy countries, the OECD countries. If you equalize your price, then we're going to put your future applications at the front of the line.\n\n(32:58)A voucher to get a review in weeks has a market street value of about $500 million, because every day is money when it comes to getting a drug approved. And so, if you meet one of the president's national priorities stated very clearly, moving manufacturing to the United States, meeting a large unmet public health need, or equalizing your prices … We're the largest purchasers of drugs, we deserve the best prices. And so, we're going to do our part. And the generic company makes their drug in the United States, that application is going to move to the front of the line as well. And if you're going to build a plant in the United States, our FDA inspectors will walk through that plant during the construction phase, something never done before, so, that it's ready on day one.\n\n(33:46)So, thank you, Mr. President for your leadership. They said it couldn't be done, and here we are.\n\nDonald Trump (33:50):\n\nThank you. Chris, you may want to go up, and just show one of the boards about how quickly the price has come down. These are small examples. We're going to have it over 1000% in some cases. You'll see that during the week. But we just picked out four at random, and you see the kind of numbers.\n\n(34:12)Bobby, maybe … Good.\n\nChris Klomp (34:15):\n\nYou picked four examples, but I want to be totally clear, these are not the only four examples, and as the president mentioned, this is not the only agreement. It is the first. It's a historic agreement. There are many to come, and we're excited to talk about them, and that means hundreds and hundreds of drugs. We are not exaggerating when we talk about reductions of up to 80%.\n\n(34:36)We give you four examples here. One for dermatitis, a new price [inaudible 00:34:40] results in 80% reduction to what's available today. One in post-menopausal osteoporosis, 85%. Migraines that affect so many Americans, 50% reductions. Rheumatoid arthritis, something my own mother struggled with, 40% reductions.\n\n(34:54)This is about access. This is about ensuring Americans have access to life-saving medications. These are real prices. These are net prices. They're not made up. They're not funny numbers.\n\nDonald Trump (35:05):\n\nThank you very much. [inaudible 00:35:07] everybody here has been incredible. We've been standing here talking about the Make America Healthy Again a lot lately, and I think our meeting the other day was excellent on a thing called Tylenol. That was a very important meeting. I think that's a very important meeting.\n\n(35:27)And this in terms of pricing, it's going to be great for Medicare, Medicaid, Social Security. It's going to be great for everything, because your medicine costs are coming way down. We have some examples that I think we'll be able to show you next week of over 1000% in some cases for a pill that costs $10 in London was costing $130 in New York, and various other places within the United States.\n\n(35:51)And the same thing with Canada. People would go to Canada, they'd go to Mexico, they'd go to other places to buy drugs. They don't have to do that anymore. So, we have favored nations. So, this is what we have. And that's one of the biggest days I think anybody will ever have.\n\n(36:07)We're talking about massive numbers, and the numbers are going to get even better with a little time. And I will say, Albert, I think that the drug companies are going to be the same. The world … We're really competing against the world. So, they have more people. So, we'll come down a lot, and the world's going to go up a little bit, and the end result is you're going to I think do the same business pretty much. Maybe you'll figure a way to do more business I think knowing you.\n\n(36:31)But I think the drug companies … We're going to come down a lot, the U.S. The U.S. will come down a lot, but the world, many more people is going to go up a little bit, and it equalized, and it's a great tribute. And I want to thank everybody up here. JD, thank you for all of your help too, and Howard, great, really great job. Thank you all very much. Do you have any questions? How about we focus on this? It's so big, let's focus on this.\n\nSpeaker 2 (36:57):\n\nMr. President-\n\nSpeaker 3 (36:58):\n\nCan you please give us a timeline?\n\nSpeaker 2 (36:59):\n\nMr. President, first of all, this goes along with your America First campaign promises. Right? Lowering healthcare costs. On a day that it seems like we're going into a government shutdown, led by Democrats, on the premise of providing health benefits to illegals, this seems to cut … Your move here is a starch contrast to that. Could the same principles that you did today apply to health insurance? To maybe lower the cost of health insurance when Americans are struggling-\n\nDonald Trump (37:27):\n\nYeah. And we're working on just that. A little different group, but we're working on just that. I don't know to this extent. We have a pill, one pill, in particular, we're going to show you next week. It sells for $10 in other countries, and $137 in the U.S. and that's coming down now to probably $15 or $18. They'll go up to $18. I think that's pretty much right, Albert. It's not you, but they'll go up to $18, and we'll come down from $135 or whatever down to $18. That's a massive number. Remember, I was the one that held a news conference, because I lowered drug prices by one-quarter of 1%. I think it was one-eighth of 1%. But it was the only one in 28 years that brought drug prices down for the year, but it was a very small number.\n\n(38:17)Now we're talking about … You're going to see one over 1000%. Look at these numbers. And this has a big impact, even on the discussion that we'll have with Chuck Schumer, who was here yesterday, along with the very nice gentleman, who I didn't really know. You know who I'm talking about.\n\n(38:37)The two of them came, and they had a good discussion, and we're going to see what happens. We're going to see what happens, but this has a huge impact on that, because these numbers are going to bring Medicaid's … We're talking about Obamacare. Obamacare is a failure. Obamacare is not good. It's there, but relative to other healthcare programs, it's in the lower 20%. It's not good, and I asked the Democrat representatives, \"What do you think about coming up with a better healthcare?\"\n\n(39:08)This actually allows you to do that, because the costs of prescription medicine is I guess a very big … More than 50% the costs of what we're talking about. So, we might be able to do something like that.\n\n(39:20)This is one of the biggest news conference, from a medical standpoint, that I think has ever been had by any administration. Yeah, please.\n\nSpeaker 4 (39:28):\n\nMr. President, thank you. I'm curious where are the other companies other than Pfizer? Are you expecting them to come-\n\nDonald Trump (39:36):\n\n[inaudible 00:39:36], and I was honored to have Albert be the first. He's done a fantastic job, as you know, with the COVID. He did a fantastic job with a lot of things. He's a leader, and Pfizer is right at the top. It's there. Eli Lilly has been fantastic also, your friend, my friend. And they're all coming in over the next week. We're making deals with all of them.\n\n(39:59)And I said if we don't make a deal, then we're going to tariff them an extra 5%, 6%, 7%, 8%, whatever the difference is, and we'll take it that way. So, we took away the advantage by the fact that we have tariffs. We took away the advantage that they would have of just saying no, and we couldn't do anything about it. If they do that, what we do is we'll put a tariff on them of an equivalent amount, and we take it that way. And nobody wants to play that game.\n\nSpeaker 4 (40:22):\n\n[inaudible 00:40:23].\n\nDonald Trump (40:22):\n\nSo, they're all going to be good.\n\nSpeaker 4 (40:26):\n\nAre you-\n\nDonald Trump (40:26):\n\nWe didn't have to mention that to Albert, but maybe I whispered it to him very slightly. We had to give ourselves a little bit of an advantage. But, no. But the tariffs played a big role, because they know that's what's going to happen.\n\nSpeaker 5 (40:42):\n\n[inaudible 00:40:40] you mentioned the exemption of the 232s, but can you share a timeline to that 232 investigation?\n\nDonald Trump (40:52):\n\nI'll let Howard answer that question, please.\n\nSpeaker 6 (40:54):\n\nSure. So, while we're negotiating with these companies, we're going to let them play out and finish these negotiations, because they are the most important thing to American people. So, we are standing by, helping …\n\n(41:09)… the driver of the 232 outcomes is our HHS team, because look what they've accomplished today. So, we are on their side helping them, but that is the model that's [inaudible 00:41:23].\n\nDonald Trump (41:23):\n\nAnd you have to understand Albert's spending $70 billion that he wouldn't be spending, because of the tariffs, let's say, and other reasons. I think he liked the winner of November 5th, in all fairness, but because of the tariffs.\n\n(41:34)And that wouldn't happen … He's not going to pay any tariffs, because when he moves here, there are no tariffs. So, he won't be paying tariffs. That's the beauty of it. If you move here, there are no tariffs, and we have over $17 trillion, Albert. So, can you believe these numbers?\n\n(41:51)So, Biden had less than a trillion for four years. We have over $17 trillion for, essentially, eight months. Pretty amazing.\n\nSpeaker 7 (42:01):\n\n[inaudible 00:42:01] when the prices come down, Mr. President? When [inaudible 00:42:05]?\n\nDonald Trump (42:09):\n\nImmediately they're going to start coming down. Drug prices, they'll be starting immediately. Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 8 (42:10):\n\nMr. President, can you speak to what impact you think this reduction in drug prices will have on midterms coming up?\n\nDonald Trump (42:17):\n\nI think it's going to have a huge … I said if we can pull this off before midterms … I've wanted to do it from the beginning, from my first day and first term. And we were doing so well. We had the greatest economy we've ever had. Everything was good.\n\n(42:30)And then we're ready to do this, which is complex and big. It's a big change. But what happened is COVID came, and we focused on COVID. We focused on COVID very hard with Albert, with the other companies, with everybody. Regeneron was a great thing. We did a lot of therapeutics that were fantastic.\n\n(42:50)And so, we focused on that, and I said, \"If I pull this off again, the first thing I'm going to do …\" And we've been working on this for eight months. It's a very big deal. This is a big shock to the system. But it's not as much as I said. The world is going to go up a little bit, and we're going to come down a lot. But now it's fair.\n\nSpeaker 9 (43:08):\n\nMr. Trump-\n\nDonald Trump (43:09):\n\nWe're going to be paying the same thing. Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 9 (43:11):\n\nPresident Trump, in first term when you cut the price of insulin, Biden later came in and tried to steal credit for that.\n\nDonald Trump (43:17):\n\nYeah.\n\nSpeaker 9 (43:19):\n\nDo you worry that the Democrats are going to try to steal credit for these historic cuts?\n\nDonald Trump (43:22):\n\nYeah. [inaudible 00:43:23] do is … I really appreciate your question, because I did. I cut the price of insulin down to $35. And the problem is with many of these things … This case, it's going to be pretty quick, but often times you'll do something medically, because of the process, and it won't be seen for two or three years. That happened also with … I could say four different things.\n\n(43:47)But just if you talk about insulin, so, it was $200, $300, $500, and you couldn't get it, and I got it down to $35. And I said, \"I hope I win the next election, because, otherwise, whoever wins is going to take credit for it.\" Well, what happened is we did win the election. We did great, but, unfortunately, it didn't work out that way from a practical standpoint.\n\n(44:07)And Biden, when I saw him get up and take credit for the $35, and even less, insulin, that was 1000% lower than what it was just previous, boy, I tell you I didn't like it. I didn't like it.\n\n(44:22)So, I did the best I could to let them know we did it, because we want to be given credit. But we are the ones that got insulin down to that number, and you're right. They tried to take credit for it. They had nothing to do … In fact, they didn't even know what happened. All of a sudden, the insulin price kicked in to $35, and they asked Biden about it. He had no idea what the hell they were talking about, but after they explained and … They didn't really explain it to him, because he was not capable really of understanding, but when they went out and talked about it, they acted like it was a great feat, but it had nothing to do with him.\n\n(44:52)And it continues, and we'll get it down even further, but insulin was … People weren't taking it, I would imagine. They couldn't …\n\nDonald Trump (45:00):\n\nGod bless you, Bobby. I hope I didn't catch COVID just there. Don't you have Paxlovid? He's got Paxlovid. Give me a Paxlovid immediately.\n\nSpeaker 10 (45:17):\n\nWhile Nancy Pelosi is ignoring what you're doing for the American people. She's going after your administration for cutting taxpayer-funded healthcare for illegal aliens last night.\n\nDonald Trump (45:27):\n\nWho was doing that?\n\nSpeaker 10 (45:27):\n\nNancy Pelosi. She went on NBC last night, dropped a bunch of F bombs, told Republicans to go F themselves. Has she lost her mind?\n\nDonald Trump (45:36):\n\nWe have done an unbelievable job medically. Just this, if you did nothing else, we've done a lot, like the insulin. But just this, nobody can ever catch this. This is the biggest price-reduction, maybe 10 times, 15 times that has ever been given before. And this is going to have a huge impact. As I said, Obamacare is not a good thing. It's been bad and I'd like to make it better. I spoke to a lot of people, a lot of Democrats recently. I said, \"Why don't we change it? We can make Obamacare much better. We could come up with a new system that would be much better, less expensive for the people and better.\"\n\n(46:13)This is maybe the biggest breakthrough because when you're talking about the prescription drugs, that's a big part of it. So, this is prescription, but we're going to be looking at that. We could come up, and through this whole thing because, I don't know, we'll probably have a shutdown. Because one of the things they want to do is they want to give incredible Medicare, the Cadillac Medicare to illegal immigrants. And what that does is it keeps them coming into our country, like they do in California, and no country can afford that, no country. And we have the border stopped up, we have it closed. We have nobody for four months, zero. Zero people came in. That wasn't me. That's by the authorities who happen to be liberally-oriented.\n\n(46:57)But just think of that, we have people offering healthcare to people all over the world that they can't afford to pay, and that's the Democrats. And what that does is it brings people into the country because they want to come in for the healthcare, but no country can afford it and they can't afford it. So, we cannot allow them to charge tremendous amounts of money for healthcare for people that aren't even citizens. And in many cases, they come in from prisons, jails, and mental institutions. And we can't let that happen. So, we have a big fight over that.\n\n(47:33)We have a fight over open borders. They still want open borders. We're having a fight over men in women's sports, if you believe it. You would've thought they would've learned that it's not a good issue. And we have a fight in transgenders, as you know, transgender for everybody. And that, when you talk medically, that's a lot of money too. Those operations are bad.\n\n(47:56)So, those things are also being discussed right now. I mean, can you imagine we're actually talking about open borders? We now have a great border and we have a great country. Our country was dead one year ago. Now, we have the hottest country anywhere in the world. Big difference. Yeah?\n\nSpeaker 11 (48:11):\n\nMr. president, what does it say about the Democrat party when they have a 33% favorability rating on average in recent months, and they're willing to shut down the government over healthcare?\n\nDonald Trump (48:21):\n\nThey are shutting it down. We're not shutting it down. We don't want it to shut down because we have the greatest period of time ever. I told you we have $17 trillion being invested. So, the last person that wants to shut down is us. Now, with that being said, we can do things during the shutdown that are irreversible, that are bad for them and irreversible by them, like cutting vast numbers of people out, cutting things that they like, cutting programs that they like. And you all know Russell Vought, he's become very popular recently because he can trim the budget to a level that you couldn't do any other way.\n\n(48:56)So, they're taking a risk by having a shutdown, because of the shutdown, we can do things medically and other ways, including benefits, we can cut large numbers of people out. We don't want to do that, but we don't want fraud, waste and abuse and we're cutting that. But they want to have illegal aliens come into our country and get massive healthcare at the cost to everybody else and we don't have it. And that's, I would say the number one reason that they want to strike is to get illegal immigrants healthcare. And Gavin Newsom wants that too in California, and it's destroying California. We can't have that. We're not going to let it happen.\n\nSpeaker 14 (49:38):\n\nDo you have a plan for dealing with drug companies that are responding to MFN only by raising prices overseas, as opposed to lowering prices in the US.\n\nDonald Trump (49:47):\n\nNo, they're responding. I understand that question very well, but they're responding by lowering prices. They're helped by lowering prices. There's a price at which they can't sell, and they're helped by lowering prices. And in the case of Eli Lilly, the fact is our prices are coming down massively. You see, that's just a few of the basics, but they're coming down much more than that with many drugs. And over 1,000%, think of that, over 1,000% reduction. And we'll show you that next week because we have some of them on the board next week where you have over 1,000% price reduction. Now, what's going to happen is the market will kick in. This way the market kicks in. The other way, it was just a form of control. You were stifling the market. Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 15 (50:33):\n\nAt this point, is a shutdown inevitable? And how would you describe the negotiations with Democrats yesterday? Are more meetings scheduled?\n\nDonald Trump (50:42):\n\nSo, nothing is inevitable, but I would say it's probably likely because they want to give healthcare to illegal immigrants, which will destroy healthcare for everybody else in our country. And I didn't see them bend even a little bit when I said, \"We can't do that.\" Okay?\n\nSpeaker 12 (51:00):\n\nCan I ask a question to Dr. Oz and the Ministry of Health?\n\nDonald Trump (51:01):\n\nYes.\n\nSpeaker 12 (51:03):\n\nIf there is no deal reached on the Obamacare subsidies with the Democrats, is there anything that CMS can do to mitigate the increases of those Obamacare subsidies?\n\nMehmet Oz (51:16):\n\nNot really, but we have time. We have time till the end of the year to make the changes. I know the president is evaluating, but we should have a clean, continuing resolution, get past this budget process, as it has happened so many times, and allow the president and leadership some freedom to be able to put some good ideas in front of the legislative bodies.\n\nSpeaker 13 (51:35):\n\nMr. president, undocumented immigrants-\n\nDonald Trump (51:37):\n\nWe actually do have time for that.\n\nSpeaker 13 (51:39):\n\n… they're not eligible for the healthcare subsidies that Democrats are demanding. So, can you clarify what are you talking about when you say Democrats want to protect their healthcare?\n\nDonald Trump (51:49):\n\nSo, when an illegal person comes in, a person who came into our country illegally, therefore breaking the law. And look, we all have big hearts. I have a bigger heart than you do. They're all breaking the law and they're coming into our country. And we, just as a country, cannot afford to take care of millions of people who have broken the law coming in. We want them to come into our country, but we want them to come in legally.\n\n(52:12)Now, we have a strong border, very strong border, thanks to Christie and Tom Homan and the whole group. They've done an amazing job at the border. I mean, we had a border that was reckless. We had a border that was a disaster. They were coming in by the millions. I say 25 million people, you're saying less, but I say 25 million people came in illegally. And no system can take care of the healthcare of all of those people that came in. Now, a lot of them have gone out. We have over 11,000 murderers. We got many of them out. Many of those people have been taken out of the country, brought back to where they came from. In some cases, put in prison because they're so dangerous, we don't want to take them out. We have to watch them. We don't want them coming back.\n\n(52:52)But if you look at what's happened in Washington DC right now, it is such a… I just drove through it and it's clean and nice and beautiful and people are walking around, and they're not afraid of being mugged. We haven't had murders, we haven't had anything happen in a long time. It took us 12 days to make it very good. It took us 20 days to make it beautiful. And now, we're going to Memphis. But I think we should always keep a presence here because if we don't keep a presence, it's going to come back, never like it was because we got rid of 1,700 career criminals. You know what that is? One career criminal could give you a lousy reputation for danger because they commit many crimes a day in some cases. But Washington DC is an unbelievable example of what can happen. And now we're going, as you know, to Memphis, which was very similar to Washington, very dangerous. And we're there and we're working along very well with the governor, the mayor. A lot of these Democrat mayors, what they don't want, they don't want to have us do well because if we do well, it makes them look bad and they shouldn't feel that way.\n\n(53:54)If I were a Democrat and I was a governor or mayor, I'd be calling Trump. I'd say, \"Get your troops over here. Just help.\" Because the mayor of Washington's getting a lot of credit for what we did, a lot of credit. But the beauty is, isn't it nice? Seriously, you walk down the street, you're not going to be mugged, you're not going to be hit. We had a meeting about three, four months ago, and I was saying to the media, \"How many of you people have been threatened or mugged or accosted during your walk to the White House?\" And they said, \"We don't walk to the White House anymore.\" But the answer was… Remember Brian? Almost everybody's…\n\n(54:29)Oh, look at this guy, they even attacked this big strong guy, right? Didn't you get attacked?\n\nSpeaker 16 (54:33):\n\n[inaudible 00:54:33] Mr. President, with all due respect-\n\nDonald Trump (54:34):\n\nYeah, just take a look at the other guy, right? What happened to the other guy? I don't know. Those other guys are pretty tough. They're tough with a gun in their hand, right?\n\nSpeaker 16 (54:40):\n\nYeah.\n\nDonald Trump (54:41):\n\nAnd yeah, you were hit pretty hard, but almost everybody was. And now, anybody been accosted in the last three weeks? If I would've said that six months ago, half the hands would've been raised out. No, we have a very safe city now. The country's going to be safe. We're doing one at a time and we'll be going to Chicago. I told you this story. Union Pacific, head of the railroad, he knows this country very well. Started off as a very low-rung employee of the Union Pacific. He's now chairman. He came to me and he said, \"Sir, save Chicago. It's a great city. It's going down fast.\" They had 11 people killed over the last couple of weeks. 11 people killed. 48 shot. That's not a city, that's a war zone. There's no city in the world like that.\n\n(55:29)And then, we have to listen to this Pritzker get up. I know him well. The family throw him out of the business because he's a loser. But we have to listen to Pritzker get up. He should call me and say, \"Get the troops and…\" You ever hear that 11 people over a week and a half killed, and I think it's, when you add it up, 48 people shot. And then, I have to listen to a governor say how nice it is. It's a wonderful experience. Now, what is a wonderful experience is DC. People are eating in the restaurants. They just opened two new restaurants, which hasn't worked in years.\n\n(56:04)And we had it pretty good four years ago. We were just getting ready to do this, but we did it right. And we have a big victory in the Supreme Court. It's called merit, and that includes the military, our soldiers. Did you see what they looked like? These guys, they looked like serious soldiers. They weren't playing games. And they went in there and they did a fantastic job. And Washington DC is now a beautiful, safe city. The restaurants are thriving. The people are walking down the street, holding their husband or their boyfriend's hand, and they're not worried about being raped or mugged or shot at. And it's been an amazing thing. And we'll do that in every city. We'll do them one at a time. We'll do a couple at a time and we have a tremendous force because as you know in recruitment numbers, two years ago when Biden would put out recruitment, nobody would join. Nobody wanted to be in the military. Nobody wanted to be police. It was just announced this morning, you probably saw my speech over with the military, with the generals, admirals, record numbers of people signing up for the Navy, the Army, Air Force, Marines, Coast Guard, Space Force. I love Space Force. That was my baby. But we have record numbers of people signing up, and that includes police department, fire department. So, it's been an amazing thing.\n\n(57:24)Well, we're going to have another meeting next week on this. We have another great company coming in. Similar kind of numbers, but we're going to show you some 1,000% drops in prices. There has never been anything like this in the history of medicine and it's an honor. And Albert, I want to thank you and I want to thank everybody behind me because you are a great team. We have a great team. Everybody says you have a great cabinet, it's a great team. So, thank you, Bobby. Thank you very much. Thank you-",

    "transcript": "Dan Caine (03:26):\n\nLadies and gentlemen, please welcome the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, General Dan Caine.\n\nDan Caine (03:39):\n\nAll right, Generals, Admirals, senior leaders, good morning. Wow, what a group here today. I will tell you that our enemies are terrified right now that we are all in the same room, and that is a true statement. Welcome everyone to Marine Corps Base Quantico and the first ever key leaders all call. To the Commandants and all of the Marines that have made this event possible, thank you. This was no small feat to put this event together in short order, and I'm glad there's pull-up bars just outside. The SEALs in the corner out there are very happy about that. I regret to inform you there will not be a PT test after this event, because I know you all would crush it.\n\n(04:34)Last night I had the privilege of joining the secretary and the Joint Chiefs in honoring 50 gold star families at the White House as the president, the first lady and our nation honored their loved ones' service and sacrifices. Teammates, it was a quiet and deeply meaningful event that reminded all of us that were lucky enough to be there of the serious and unforgiving nature of the business that we are in, fighting and winning our nation's wars.\n\n(05:09)Leaders, we are living in dynamic and potentially dangerous times. Global risk is on the rise. Our adversaries are no longer aligning. They are aligned. And we must align with equal resolve and unity. Even as we strive for and seek peace, we must be prepared for war. Now more than ever, it is vital that we hear from our civilian leaders, understand where they're taking the department and the joint force. And today we have the unprecedented opportunity and honor to hear directly from the Secretary of War and our Commander-in-Chief. Together you and I and our civilian leaders have the honor of leading the finest military in the world and we must seize every opportunity, every day to prepare our joint force for the future. I am deeply humbled to serve with each and every one of you. And now it is my distinct honor to introduce our nation's Secretary of War, the Honorable Pete Hegseth.\n\nPete Hegseth (06:30):\n\nThank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you. Please take your seats. Well, Mr. Chairman, the Joint Chiefs, Generals, Admirals, Commanders, officers, senior enlisted, NCOs, enlisted in every member of our American military. Good morning. Good morning and welcome to the War Department, because the era of the Department of Defense is over. You see the motto of my first platoon was those who long for peace must prepare for war. This is of course not a new idea. This crowd knows that. The origin dates to the fourth century Rome and has been repeated ever since, including by our first commander in chief, George Washington, the first leader of the War Department. It captures a simple yet profound truth. To ensure peace, we must prepare for war.\n\n(07:45)From this moment forward, the only mission of the newly restored Department of War is this, war-fighting, preparing for war and preparing to win. Unrelenting and uncompromising in that pursuit. Not because we want war. No one here wants war, but it's because we love peace. We love peace for our fellow citizens. They deserve peace and they rightfully expect us to deliver it.\n\n(08:18)Our number one job, of course, is to be strong so that we can prevent war in the first place. The President talks about it all the time. It's called peace through strength. And as history teaches us, the only people who actually deserve peace are those who are willing to wage war to defend it. That's why pacifism is so naive and dangerous. It ignores human nature and it ignores human history. Either you protect your people and your sovereignty or you will be subservient to something or someone. It's a truth as old as time. And since waging war is so costly in blood and treasure, we owe our republic a military that will win any war we choose or any war that is thrust upon us. Should our enemies choose foolishly to challenge us, they will be crushed by the violence, precision, and ferocity of the War Department. In other words, to our enemies, F-A- F-O. If necessary, our troops can translate that for you. Another way to put it is peace through strength, brought to you by the warrior ethos, and we are restoring both.\n\n(09:49)As President Trump has said and he's right. We have the strongest, most powerful, most lethal and most prepared military on the planet. That is true full stop. Nobody can touch us. It's not even close. This is true largely because of the historic investments that he made in his first term, and we will continue in this term, but it's also true because of the leaders in this room and the incredible troops that you all lead. But the world, and as the chairman mentioned, our enemies get a vote. You feel it. I feel it. This is a moment of urgency, mounting urgency. Enemies gather, threats grow. There is no time for games. We must be prepared. If we're going to prevent and avoid war, we must prepare now. We are the strength part of peace through strength, and either we're ready to win or we are not.\n\n(10:53)You see, this urgent moment of course requires more troops, more munitions, more drones, more Patriots, more submarines, more B-21 bombers. It requires more innovation, more AI in everything and ahead of the curve. More cyber effects, more counter UAS, more space, more speed. America is the strongest, but we need to get stronger and quickly. The time is now and the cause is urgent. The moment requires restoring and refocusing our defense industrial base, our shipbuilding industry, and on-shoring all critical components. It requires, as President Trump has done, getting our allies and partners to step up and share the burden.\n\n(11:33)America cannot do everything. The free world requires allies with real hard power, real military leadership, and real military capabilities. The War Department is tackling and prioritizing all of these things and I'll be giving a speech next month that'll showcase the speed, innovation, and generational acquisition reforms we are undertaking urgently. Likewise, the nature of the threats we face in our hemisphere and in deterring China is another speech for another day coming soon.\n\n(12:07)This speech today, as I drink my coffee, this speech today is about people and it's about culture. The topic today is about the nature of ourselves because no plan, no program, no reform, no formation will ultimately succeed unless we have the right people and the right culture at the War Department. If I've learned one core lesson in my eight months in this job, it's that personnel is policy. Personnel is policy. The best way to take care of troops is to give them good leaders committed to the war fighting culture of the department. Not perfect leaders, good leaders, competent, qualified, professional, agile, aggressive, innovative, risk-taking, apolitical, faithful to their oath and to the institution.\n\n(13:08)Eugene Sledge in his World War II memoir wrote, \"War is brutish. Inglorious and a terrible waste\" combat leaves an indelible mark on those who are forced to endure it. The only redeeming factors are my comrades' incredible bravery and their devotion to each other.\" In combat, there are thousands of variables, as I learned in Iraq and Afghanistan, and as so many of you did, in so many more places. Leaders can only control about three of them. You control how well you're trained, mostly how well you're equipped, and the last variable is how well you lead. After that, you're on your own.\n\n(13:51)Our war fighters are entitled to be led by the best and most capable leaders. That is who we need you all to be. Even then in combat, even if you do everything right, you may still lose people because the enemy always gets a vote. We have a sacred duty to ensure that our warriors are led by the most capable and qualified combat leaders. This is one thing you and I can control, and we owe it to the force to deliver it.\n\n(14:19)For too long, we have simply not done that. The military has been forced by foolish and reckless politicians to focus on the wrong things. In many ways, this speech is about fixing decades of decay, some of it obvious, some of it hidden. Or as the chairman has put it, we are clearing out the debris, removing the distractions, clearing the way for leaders to be leaders. You might say we're ending the war on warriors. I heard someone wrote a book about that.\n\n(14:59)For too long, we've promoted too many uniformed leaders for the wrong reasons based on their race, based on gender quotas, based on historic so-called firsts. We've pretended that combat arms and non-combat arms are the same thing. We've weeded out so-called toxic leaders under the guise of double-blind psychology assessments, promoting risk-averse go-along to get-along conformists instead. You name it, the department did it. Foolish and reckless political leaders set the wrong compass heading and we lost our way. We became the woke department, but not anymore.\n\n(15:43)Right now I'm looking out at a sea of Americans who made a choice when they were young men and young women to do something most Americans will not, to serve something greater than yourself, to fight for God and country for freedom and the Constitution. You made a choice to serve when others did not, and I commend you. You are truly the best of America. But this does not mean, and this goes for all of us, that our path to this auditorium on this day was a straight line or that the conditions of the formations we lead are where we want them to be. You love your country and we love this uniform, which is why we must do better. We just have to be honest. We have to say with our mouths what we see with our eyes, to just tell it like it is in plain English, to point out the obvious things right in front of us. That's what leaders must do. We cannot go another day without directly addressing the plank in our own eye, without addressing the problems in our own commands and in our own formations. This administration has done a great deal from day one to remove the social justice, politically correct, and toxic ideological garbage that had infected our department, to rip out the politics. No more identity months, DEI offices, dudes in dresses. No more climate change worship, no more division, distraction, or gender delusions. No more debris. As I've said before and will say again, we are done with that shit.\n\n(17:38)I've made it my mission to uproot the obvious distractions that made us less capable and less lethal. That said, the war department requires the next step. Underneath the woke garbage is a deeper problem and a more important problem that we are fixing and fixing fast. Common sense is back at the White House, so making the necessary changes is actually pretty straightforward. President Trump expects it. And the litmus test for these changes, it's pretty simple. Would I want my eldest son who is 15 years old eventually joining the types of formations that we are currently wielding?\n\n(18:25)If in any way the answer to that is no or even yes, but, then we're doing something wrong, because my son is no more important than any other American citizen who dons the cloth of our nation. He is no more important than your son, all precious souls made in the image and likeness of God. Every parent deserves to know that their son or their daughter that joins our ranks is entering exactly the kind of unit that the Secretary of War would want his son to join.\n\n(18:59)Think of it as the golden rule test. Jesus said, \"Do unto others that which you would have done unto yourself.\" It's the ultimate simplifying test of truth. The New War Department golden rule is this, do unto your unit as you would have done unto your own child's unit. Would you want him serving with fat or unfit or under-trained troops or alongside people who can't meet basic standards or in a unit where standards were lowered so certain types of troops could make it in, in a unit where leaders were promoted for reasons other than merit, performance and war fighting? The answer is not just no, it's hell no.\n\n(19:46)This means at the war department, first and foremost, we must restore a ruthless, dispassionate, and common sense application of standards. I don't want my son serving alongside troops who are out of shape or in combat unit with females who can't meet the same combat arms physical standards as men, or troops who are not fully proficient on their assigned weapons platform or task, or under a leader who was the first but not the best. Standards must be uniform, gender neutral, and high. If not, they're not standards, they're just suggestions, suggestions that get our sons and daughters killed.\n\n(20:37)When it comes to combat arms units, and there are many different stripes across our joint force, the era of politically correct, overly sensitive, don't hurt anyone's feelings leadership ends right now at every level. Either you can meet the standard, either you can do the job, either you are disciplined, fit and trained, or you are out. And that's why today at my direction, and this is the first of 10 department award directives that are arriving at your commands as we speak and in your inbox, today at my direction, each service will ensure that every requirement for every combat MOS, for every designated combat arms position returns to the highest male standard only. Because this job is life or death. Standards must be met. And not just met at every level, we should seek to exceed the standard, to push the envelope, to compete. It's common sense and core to who we are and what we do. It should be in our DNA. Today at my direction, we are also adding a combat field test for combat arms units that must be executable in any environment at any time and with combat equipment. These tests, they'll look familiar, they'll resemble the Army Expert Physical Fitness assessment or the Marine Corps Combat fitness test. I'm also directing that war fighters in combat jobs execute their service fitness test at a gender-neutral, age-normed male standard scored above 70%. It all starts with physical fitness and appearance.\n\n(22:24)If the Secretary of War can do regular, hard PT, so can every member of our joint force. Frankly, it's tiring to look out at combat formations or really any formation and see fat troops. Likewise, it's completely unacceptable to see fat generals and admirals in the halls of the Pentagon and leading commands around the country and the world. It's a bad look. It is bad and it's not who we are. So whether you're an airborne ranger or a chair-borne ranger, a brand new private or a four-star general, you need to meet the height and weight standards and pass your PT test. And as the Chairman said, yes, there is no PT test. But today at my direction, every member of the joint force at every rank is required to take a PT test twice a year, as well as meet height and weight requirements twice a year, every year of service.\n\n(23:20)Also today, at my direction, every warrior across our joint force is required to do PT every duty day. Should be common sense. Most units do that already, but we're codifying it. And we're not talking like hot yoga and stretching, real, hard PT either as a unit or as an individual. At every level, from the joint chiefs to everyone in this room to the youngest private, leaders set the standard and so many of you do this already, active, guard, and reserve. This also means grooming standards. No more beards, long hair, superficial individual expression. We're going to cut our hair, shave our beards, and adhere to standards. Because it's like the broken windows theory of policing. It's like when you let the small stuff go, the big stuff eventually goes, so you have to address the small stuff. This is on duty, in the field, and in the rear. If you want a beard, you can join special forces. If not, then shave.\n\n(24:22)We don't have a military full of Nordic pagans, but unfortunately we have had leaders who either refused to call BS and enforce standards or leaders who felt like they were not allowed to enforce standards. Both are unacceptable. And that's why today at my direction, the era of unprofessional appearance is over. No more beardos. The era of rampant and ridiculous shaving profiles is done. Simply put, if you do not meet the male level physical standards for combat positions, cannot pass a PT test, or don't want to shave and look professional, it's time for a new position or a new profession. I sincerely appreciate the proactive efforts the secretaries have already taken in some of those areas, service secretaries. And these directives are intended to simply accelerate those efforts.\n\n(25:18)On the topic of standards, allow me a few words to talk about toxic leaders. Upholding and demanding high standards is not toxic. Enforcing high standards, not toxic leadership. Leading war fighters toward the goals of high, gender-neutral, and uncompromising standards in order to forge a cohesive, formidable, and lethal department of war is not toxic. It is our duty, consistent with our constitutional oath.\n\n(25:53)Real toxic leadership is endangering subordinates with low standards. Real toxic leadership is promoting people based on immutable characteristics or quotas instead of based on merit. Real toxic leadership is promoting destructive ideologies that are an anathema to the constitution and the laws of nature and nature's God, as Thomas Jefferson wrote in the Declaration of Independence. The definition of toxic has been turned upside down and we're correcting that. That's why today at my direction we're undertaking a full review of the department's definitions of so-called toxic leadership, bullying, and hazing to empower leaders to enforce standards without fear of retribution or second guessing.\n\n(26:40)Of course, you can't do like nasty bullying and hazing. We're talking about words like bullying and hazing and toxic, they've been weaponized and bastardized inside our formations, undercutting commanders and NCOs. No more. Setting, achieving, and maintaining high standards is what you all do. And if that makes me toxic, then so be it.\n\n(27:02)Second, today at our direction, we're ensuring that every service, every unit, every schoolhouse and every form of professional military education conduct an immediate review of their standards. Now, we've done this in many places already, but today it goes across the entire Department of War. Any place where tried and true physical standards were altered, especially since 2015 when combat arms standards were changed to ensure females could qualify, must be returned to their original standard. Other standards have been manipulated to hit racial quotas as well, which is just as unacceptable. This too must end. Merit only. The president talks about it all the time, merit-based.\n\n(27:48)Here are two basic frameworks I urge you to pursue in this process. Standards I call, my staff's heard all about them, the 1990 test and the E6 test. The 1990s test is simple. What were the military standards in 1990? And if they have changed, tell me why. Was it a necessary change based on the evolving landscape of combat? Or was the change due to a softening, weakening, or gender-based pursuit of other priorities? 1990s seems to be as good a place to start as any. And the E6 test, ask yourself, does what you're doing make the leadership, accountability, and lethality efforts of an E6 or frankly an O3, does it make it easier or more complicated? Does the change empower staff sergeants, petty officers, and tech sergeants to get back to basics? The answer should be a resounding yes. The E6 test or O3 test clarifies a lot, and it clarifies quickly. Because war does not care if you're a man or a woman, neither does the enemy, nor does the weight of your rucksack, the size of an artillery round, or the body weight of a casualty on the battlefield Who must be carried. This, and I want to be very clear about this, this is not about preventing women from serving. We very much value the impact of female troops. Our female officers and NCOs are the absolute best in the world. But when it comes to any job that requires physical power to perform in combat, those physical standards must be high and gender-neutral. If women can make it, excellent. If not, it is what it is. If that means no women qualify for some combat jobs, so be it. That is not the intent, but it could be the result, so be it. It will also mean that weak men won't qualify,\n\nPete Hegseth (30:00):\n\nBecause we're not playing games. This is combat. This is life or death. As we all know, this is you versus an enemy hell-bent on killing you. To be an effective lethal fighting force, you must trust that the warrior alongside you in battle is capable, truly, physically capable of doing what is necessary under fire. You know, this is the only standard you would want for your kids and for your grandkids. Apply the war department golden rule, the 1990 test and the E6 test, and it's really hard to go wrong. Third, we are attacking and ending the walking on eggshells and zero defect command culture. A risk-averse culture means officers execute not to lose instead of to win. A risk-averse culture means NCOs are not empowered to enforce standards. Commanders and NCOs don't take necessary risks or make tough adjustments for fear of rocking the boat or making mistakes.\n\n(31:08)A blemish-free record is what peacetime leaders covet the most, which is the worst of all incentives. You, we as senior leaders need to end the poisonous culture of risk-aversion and empower our NCOs at all levels to enforce standards. Truth be told, for the most part, we don't need new standards. We just need to reestablish a culture where enforcing standards is possible, and that's why today at my direction, I'm issuing new policies that will overhaul the IGEO and MEO processes.\n\n(31:48)I call it the No More Walking on Eggshells Policy. We are liberating commanders and NCOs. We are liberating you. We are overhauling an inspector general process, the IG that has been weaponized, putting complainers, ideologues and poor performers in the driver's seat. We're doing the same with the equal opportunity and military equal opportunity policies, the EO and the MEO at our department. No more frivolous complaints, no more anonymous complaints.\n\n(32:23)No more repeat complainants, no more smearing reputations. No more endless waiting. No more legal limbo, no more sidetracking careers. No more walking on eggshells. Of course, being a racist has been illegal in our formation since 1948. The same goes for sexual harassment. Both are wrong and illegal. Those kinds of infractions will be ruthlessly enforced, but telling someone to shave or get a haircut or to get in shape or to fix their uniform or to show up on time or to work hard, that's exactly the kind of discrimination we want.\n\n(33:03)We are not civilians. You are not civilians. You are set apart for a distinct purpose. So we as a department need to stop acting and thinking like civilians and get back to basics and put the power back in the hands of commanders and NCOs. Commanders and NCOs who make life and death decisions. Commanders and NCOs who enforce standards and ensure readiness. Commanders and NCOs, who in this war department have to look in the mirror and have to pass the golden rule test, my kids, your kids, America's sons and daughters.\n\n(33:44)So I urge you all here today and those watching, take this guidance and run with it. The core of this speech is the 10 directives we're announcing today. They were written for you, for Army leadership, for Navy leadership, for Marine Corps leadership, for Air Force leadership, Space Force leadership. These directives are designed to take the monkey off your back and put you, the leadership, back in the driver's seat. Move out with urgency because we have your back. I have your back and the commander in chief has your back.\n\n(34:21)And when we give you this guidance, we know mistakes will be made. It's the nature of leadership, but you should not pay for earnest mistakes for your entire career. And that's why today at my direction, we're making changes to the retention of adverse information on personnel records that will allow leaders with forgivable, earnest, or minor infractions to not be encumbered by those infractions in perpetuity.\n\n(34:46)People make honest mistakes, and our mistakes should not define an entire career, otherwise we only try not to make mistakes and that's not the business we're in. We need risk-takers and aggressive leaders, and a culture that supports you.\n\n(35:03)Fourth, at the War Department, promotions across the joint force will be based on one thing, merit. Color-blind, gender-neutral, merit-based. The entire promotion process, including evaluations of war fighting capabilities is being thoroughly reexamined. We've already done a lot in this area, but more changes are coming soon. We'll promote top performing officers and NCOs faster and get rid of poor performers more quickly.\n\n(35:32)Evaluations, education and field exercises will become real evaluations, not box checks for every one of us at every level.\n\n(35:44)These same reforms happened before World War II as well. General George Marshall and Secretary of War, Henry Stimson did the same thing, and we won a World War because of it. As it happens, when he started the job, Chairman Kaine gave me a frame and a photo to hang in my office. A matching frame and photo hangs in his. It's a photo of Marshall and Stimson preparing for World War II.\n\n(36:13)Those two leaders famously kept the door open between their offices for the entirety of the war. They worked together, civilian and uniform every single day. Chairman Kaine and I do the same. There is no daylight between us. Our doors are always open. Our job together is to ensure our military is led by the very best, ready to answer the nation's call.\n\n(36:42)Fifth, as you have seen and the media has obsessed over, I have fired a number of senior officers since taking over. The previous chairman, other members of the joint chiefs, combatant commanders and other commanders. The rationale for me has been straightforward. It's nearly impossible to change a culture with the same people who helped create or even benefited from that culture, even if that culture was created by a previous president and previous secretary.\n\n(37:12)My approach has been simple. When in doubt, assess the situation, follow your gut, and if it's the best for the military, make a change. We all serve at the pleasure of the President every single day, but in many ways it's not their fault. It's not your fault. As foolish and reckless as the woke department was, those officers were following elected political leadership.\n\n(37:45)An entire generation of generals and admirals were told that they must parrot the insane fallacy that, quote, \"Our diversity is our strength.\" Of course, we know our unity is our strength. They had to put out dizzying DEI and LGBTQI+ statements. They were told females and males are the same thing, or that males who think they're females is totally normal. They were told that we need a green fleet and electric tanks. They were told to kick out Americans who refuse an emergency vaccine. They followed civilian policies set by foolish and reckless political leaders.\n\n(38:29)Our job, my job has been to determine which leaders simply did what they must to answer the prerogatives of civilian leadership and which leaders are truly invested in the woke department and therefore incapable of embracing the war department and executing new lawful orders. That's it. It's that simple.\n\n(38:52)So for the past eight months, we've gotten a good look under the hood of our officer corps. We've done our best to thoroughly assess the human terrain. We've had to make trade-offs and some difficult decisions. It's more of an art than a science. We have been and will continue to be judicious but also expeditious.\n\n(39:15)The new compass heading is clear, out with the Sherellis, the McKenzies and the Millis, and in with the Stockdales, the Schwarzkopf and the Patents. More leadership changes will be made, of that I'm certain, not because we want to, but because we must.\n\n(39:33)Once again, this is life and death. The sooner we have the right people, the sooner we can advance the right policies. Personnel is policy. But I look out at this group and I see great Americans, leaders who have given decades to our great republic at great sacrifice to yourselves and to your families.\n\n(39:57)But if the words I'm speaking today are making your heart sink, then you should do the honorable thing and resign. We would thank you for your service. But I suspect, I know the overwhelming majority of you feel the opposite. These words make your hearts full. You love the war department because you love what you do, the profession of arms. You are hereby liberated to be an apolitical, hard-charging, no-nonsense constitutional leader that you joined the military to be.\n\n(40:39)We need you locked in on the M, not the D, the E, or the I, not the DEI or the DIE of dying, by that I mean the M, military of the instruments of national power. We have entire departments across the government dedicated to diplomatic, informational and economic lines of effort. We do the M, nobody else does. And our GoFos need to master it in every domain and every scenario.\n\n(41:07)No more distractions, no more political ideologies, no more debris. Now of course we're going to disagree at times. We would not be Americans if we didn't. Being a leader in a large organization like ours means having frank conversations and differences of opinion.\n\n(41:27)You will win some arguments and you will lose some arguments. But when civilian leaders issue lawful orders, we execute. We are professionals in the profession of arms. Our entire constitutional system is predicated upon this understanding.\n\n(41:47)Now it seems like a small thing, but it's not. This includes as well the behavior of our troops online. To that end, I want to thank and recognize the services for their new proactive social media policies. Use them, anonymous, online or keyboard complaining is not worthy of a warrior. It's cowardice, masquerading as conscience. Anonymous unit-level social media pages that trash commanders, demoralize troops and undermine unit cohesion must not be tolerated. Again, O3s, E6s.\n\n(42:26)Sixth, we must train and we must maintain. Any moment that we are not training on our mission or maintaining our equipment is a moment we are less prepared for preventing or winning the next war. That is why today at my direction, we are drastically reducing the ridiculous amount of mandatory training that individuals and units must execute. We've already ended the most egregious. Now we're giving you back real time, less PowerPoint briefings and fewer online courses, more time in the motor pool and more time on the range.\n\n(43:03)Our job is to make sure you have the money, equipment, weapons, and parts to train and maintain and then you take it from there. You all know this because it's common sense. The tougher and the higher the standards in our units, the higher the retention rates in those units. Warriors want to be challenged.\n\n(43:22)Troops want to be tested. When you don't train and you don't maintain, you demoralize. And that's when our best people decide to take their talents to the civilian world. The leaders who created the woke department have already driven out too many hard chargers. We reverse that trend right now. There is no world in which high intensity war exists without pain, agony, and human tragedy. We are in a dangerous line of work. You are in a dangerous line of work.\n\n(43:56)We may lose good people, but let no warrior cry out from the grave, \"If only I had been properly trained.\" We will not lose war fighters because we fail to train or equip them or resource them. Shame on us if we do. Train like your warriors' lives depend on it because they do. To that point, basic training is being restored to what it should be.\n\n(44:23)Scary, tough, and disciplined. We're empowering drill sergeants to instill healthy fear in new recruits, ensuring that future war fighters are forged. Yes, they can shark attack, they can toss bunks, they can swear, and yes, they can put their hands on recruits. This does not mean they can be reckless or violate the law, but they can use tried and true methods to motivate new recruits, to make them the warriors they need to be. Back to basics at basic as well.\n\n(44:59)Of course, and you know this, basic training is not where mission readiness should end. The nature of the evolving threat environment demands that everyone in every job must be ready to join the fight if needed. A core credo of the Marine Corps is, every Marine, a rifleman. It means that everyone, regardless of MOS, is proficient enough to engage an enemy threat at sea, in the air or in a so-called rear area.\n\n(45:27)We need to ensure that every member of our uniformed military maintains baseline proficiency and basic combat skills, especially because the next war, like the last, will likely not have a rear area.\n\n(45:42)Finally, as President Trump rightly pointed out when he changed the department name, the United States has not won a major theater war since the name was changed to the Department of Defense in 1947. One conflict stands out in stark contrast, the Gulf War. Why?\n\n(46:06)Well, there's a number of reasons, but it was a limited mission with overwhelming force and a clear end state. But why did we execute and win the Gulf War the way we did in 1991? There's two overwhelming reasons. One was President Ronald Reagan's military buildup gave an overwhelming advantage.\n\n(46:23)And two, military and Pentagon leadership had previous formative battlefield experiences. The men who led this department during the Gulf War were mostly combat veterans of the Vietnam War. They said never again to mission creep or nebulous end states. The same holds true today. Our civilian and military leadership is chock-full of veterans from Iraq and Afghanistan who say never again to nation building and nebulous end states.\n\n(46:57)This clear-eyed view all the way in the White House combined with President Trump's military buildup, postures us for future victories, if and we will, and when we embrace the War Department and we must. We are preparing every day. We have to be prepared for war, not for defense. We're training warriors not defenders. We fight wars to win, not to defend.\n\n(47:24)Defense is something you do all the time. It's inherently reactionary and can lead to overuse, overreach and mission creep. War is something you do sparingly on our own terms and with clear aims. We fight to win. We unleash overwhelming and punishing violence on the enemy. We also don't fight with stupid rules of engagement. We untie the hands of our war fighters to intimidate, demoralize, hunt and kill the enemies of our country. No more politically correct and overbearing rules of engagement, just common sense, maximum lethality and authority for war fighters. That's all I ever wanted as a platoon leader and it's all my E6 squad leaders ever wanted, back to that E6 rule.\n\n(48:15)We let our leaders fight their formations and then we have their back. It's very simple, yet incredibly powerful. A few months ago, I was at the White House when President Trump announced his Liberation Day for America's trade policy. It was a landmark day.\n\n(48:34)Well, today is another Liberation Day. The liberation of America's warriors, in name, in deed, and in authorities. You kill people and break things for a living. You are not politically correct and don't necessarily belong always in polite society. We are not an army of one. We are a joint force of millions of selfless Americans. We are warriors.\n\n(49:04)We are purpose-built, not for fair weather, blue skies or calm seas. We were built to load up in the back of helicopters, five tons or Zodiacs in the dead of night, in fair weather or foul, to go to dangerous places to find those who would do our nation harm and deliver justice on behalf of the American people in close and brutal combat if necessary.\n\n(49:33)You are different. We fight not because we hate what's in front of us. We fight because we love what's behind us. You see, the Ivy League faculty lounges will never understand us, and that's okay because they could never do what you do. The media will mischaracterize us and that's okay, because deep down they know the reason they can do what they do is you. In this profession, you feel comfortable inside the violence so that our citizens can live peacefully.\n\n(50:08)Lethality is our calling card, and victory our only acceptable end state. In closing, a few weeks ago at our monthly Pentagon Christian Prayer Service, I recited a commander's prayer. It's a simple yet meaningful prayer for wisdom for commanders and leaders. I encourage you to look it up if you've never seen it, but the prayer, it ends like this. \"And most of all, Lord, please keep my soldiers safe. Lead them, guide them, protect them. Watch over them. And as you gave all of yourself for me, help me give all of myself for them. And amen.\"\n\n(50:58)I have prayed this prayer many times since I've had the privilege of being your secretary. And I will continue to pray this prayer for each of you as you command and lead our nation's finest. Go forth and do good things, hard things. President Trump has your back and so do I. And you'll hear from him shortly. Move out and draw fire because we are The War Department. Godspeed.\n\nSpeaker 1 (01:15:27):\n\nLadies and gentlemen, the Secretary of War.\n\nPete Hegseth (01:15:40):\n\nWell, you've heard from me. So now, it's the main event, our Commander-in-Chief. I have the privilege every single day of watching him put America first, of ensuring that our warfighters have everything they need. His compass is clear, he's easy to follow because you know he has our back.\n\n(01:16:02)I was thinking backstage, the man who was the Commander-in-Chief when the war department was created was George Washington. The man who was President when the war department was reestablished is President Trump. And when he found out about this gathering of senior leaders, he said, \"I would be honored to come in order to address and thank the incredible Americans who defend our nation.\" He has a heart full of gratitude and love for what you do, and we get a chance to see it every day. And I'm honored that this morning, you all firsthand get to see it as well.\n\n(01:16:41)So ladies and gentlemen, join me in welcoming the 45th and 47th President of the United States, our Commander-in-Chief, Donald J. Trump.\n\nDonald Trump (01:17:14):\n\nThank you very much, Pete. Great job you're doing too, fantastic job. I've never walked into a room so silent before. This is very... Don't laugh, don't laugh, you're not allowed to do that. You know what? Just have a good time and if you want to applaud, you applaud and if you want to do anything you want, you can do anything you want. And if you don't like what I'm saying, you can leave the room. Of course, there goes your rank, there goes your future. But you just feel nice and loose, okay? Because we're all on the same team. And I was told that, \"Sir, you won't hear a murmur in the room.\" I said, \"We have to loosen these guys up a little bit.\" So you just have a good time.\n\n(01:17:56)But I want to thank Secretary Hegseth and General Caine General Raising Caine for a reason, they call him that. When I heard his name, I said, \"You're the guy I'm looking for.\" The Joint Chiefs of Staff and so many others in this room who together represent the greatest and most elite fighting force in the history of the world, the United States military. We're very proud of our military. We built the military during my first term, it was one of the greatest achievements. We had the greatest economy in history, and I built the military. Those are the two things I say more than anything else. And I also kept us safe at the borders, we had very good borders. We didn't have people coming in from jails and prisons and everything like took place over the last four years. I'll never forget what happened to this country over the last four years with the incompetence.\n\n(01:18:46)There could be no higher honor than to serve as your Commander-in-Chief. It is a great honor. I look at you, you just, incredible people. Central casting, I might add. To each and every one of you, I thank you for your unwavering devotion to the armed forces and to the country that we've all sworn a sacred oath to defend. We all have that oath, every one of us. I'm thrilled to be here this morning to address the senior leadership of what is once again known around the world as the Department of War. I know Pete spoke about it. He gave a great speech, I thought, a great speech. I don't want him to get so good. I hate that. You know? I hate it, I almost fired him. I said, \"You can't. I don't want to go on after that.\"\n\n(01:19:33)Now, he gave a great speech, but he talked about Department of War. We were sitting there and I said, \"Didn't it used to be called the Department of War?\" And he goes, \"Yes, sir. They changed it in the early '50s.\" So we won the first World War, we won the second World War. We won everything in between and everything before that, we only won. And then we went in away woke. That was probably the first sign of woke-ness, and we change it to defense instead of war. And I said, \"What do you think? How do you think if we change it back? Would that be a nice idea?\" And Pete loved it immediately. Some people think thought about it, they gave it a little thought, but in the end we did it.\n\n(01:20:14)And I have to be honest, it's so popular, I thought would be met with fury on the left, but they're sort of giving up, I must be honest with you. They've had it, they've had it with Trump. They've been after me for so many years now. Here we are, here we are. Come to the White House anytime you'd like. Now they've given up. They're bad, a lot of bad people, but all over that's been so popular, it's been very popular. I really thought that we were going to have to sort of fight it through. There's been no fight, there's been no fight. Like what I called the Gulf of America, the Gulf of America because to me it was always the Gulf of America. I could never understand, we have 92% of the frontage and for years, actually 350 years, they were there before us, it was called the Gulf of Mexico. I just had this idea, I'm looking at a map, I'm saying, \"We have most of the frontage. Why is it Gulf of Mexico? Why isn't it the Gulf of America?\" And I made the change and it went smoothly.\n\n(01:21:19)I mean, we had a couple of fake news outlets that refused to make the change. And then one of them, AP took us to court and we won. And the judge, who was a somewhat liberal judge said, \"The name is the Gulf of America,\" because AP refused to call it the Gulf of America. They wrote, they're not a good outfit by the way. They call it the Gulf of Mexico, I said, \"No, the Gulf of America is the name.\" And the judge actually said that, \"In fact, you can't even go into the room because what you're doing is not appropriate. The name is the Gulf of America.\" Google Maps changed the name, everybody did, but AP wouldn't. And then we won in court. How about that? Isn't that so cool?\n\n(01:21:59)Then Secretary Hegseth beautifully described the name change reflects far more than the shift in branding. It's really a historic reassertion of our purpose and our identity and our pride. That's when we go with the word war. And we want war because we want to have no wars, but you have to be there and sometimes you have to do it. I have settled so many wars since we're here. We're here almost nine months and I've settled seven, and yesterday we might have settled the biggest of them all, although I don't know. Pakistan-India was very big. Both nuclear powers, I settled that. But yesterday could be the settlement in the Middle East that hasn't happened for 3,000 years. I said, \"How long have you been fighting?\" \"3,000 years, sir.\" That's a long time. But we got it, I think settled, we'll see. Hamas has to agree. It's going to be very tough on them, but it is what it is. But all of the Arab nations, Muslim nations have agreed, Israel has agreed. It's an amazing thing. It just came together.\n\n(01:23:10)War is very strange, you never know what's going to happen with war. The easiest one of them all is Putin. I said, \"Number one, it's a war that would've never happened if I were president. If the election weren't rigged. If I were president of that war would've never happened. Not even a little chance.\" And it didn't happen for four years. But I knew Putin very well and I thought that would be easy because I know him so well. Well, that one turned out to be the hardest of them all. We had some that were not settle-able and they all got settled. So, if this works out that we did yesterday with the Middle East, then that's more than a war, that's lots of wars. That's all combined, that's a lot of wars. Many of you were over there in many different capacities in many different countries. That was, that's a big part of the earth. But if that works out, it would be eight-plus. I could give myself two or three for that one.\n\n(01:24:04)And then we just have the one to settle. We have to settle it up with President Putin and Zelensky, got to get them together and get it done. But the only way we can do that is through strength. I mean, if we were weak, they wouldn't even take my phone call, but we have extreme strength. We had the horror show in Afghanistan, which is really the reason I think that Putin went in. He saw that horror show by Biden and his team of incompetent people, and that showed, I think it gave him a path in. I wasn't there any longer, I watched that and it was so, so horrible. I think it was the most embarrassing day in the history of our country. And now, we're back and that's it, and we're not going to have any of that crap happen, I can tell you. That was terrible, so terrible.\n\n(01:24:53)Together, we're reawakening the warrior spirit, and this is a spirit that won and built this nation. And from the cavalry that tamed the Great Plains to the ferocious and yielding power of Patton Bradley and the great General Douglas MacArthur, these are all great men. In this effort we're a team, and so my message to you is very simple. I am with you, I support you. And as President, I have your backs 100%. You'll never see me even waver a little bit, it's the way it is. And that includes our great police officers and firemen and all of these people that are doing so well. Together over the next few years, we're going to make our military stronger, tougher, faster, fiercer, and more powerful than it has ever been before.\n\n(01:25:46)I rebuilt our nuclear, as you probably know, but we'll upgrade that also and just hope we never have to use it. We have to hope we never have to use it, because the power of that is so incredible. I see things, I don't think they'd show it to you. I really wouldn't want to show it to you. But when you see the result of what's left, you never want to use that. Never, never, ever. We were a little bit threatened by Russia recently, and I sent a submarine, anuclear submarine. The most lethal weapon ever made. Number one, you can't detect it, there's no way. We're 25 years ahead of Russia and China in submarines. Russia is actually second in submarines, China's third, but they're coming up, they're coming up. They're a weight lower in nuclear too but in five years they'll be equal, they're coming up. And you don't have to be that good with nuclear. You could have 1/20th what you have now and still do the damage that would be so horrendous.\n\n(01:27:02)But I announced that based on his mention of nuclear, and it was really a stupid person that works for... I mentioned the word nuclear. I moved a submarine or two, I won't say about the two, over to the coast of Russia. Just to be careful, because we can't let people throw around that word. I call it the N- word. There are two N-words and you can't use either of them, can't use either of them. And frankly, if it does get to use, we have more than anybody else. We have better, we have newer, but it's something we don't ever want to even have to think about. But when somebody mentions it, that submarine started immediately thereafter. And it's just lurking, but I'm sure we're not going to have to use it. But it's an amazing, it's undetectable, totally. Ours is, theirs isn't. Theirs are totally detectable, we can detect them easily, we go right to the spot. But we have genius apparatus that doesn't allow detection. It doesn't allow detection at all by anybody, above water or below water. It's incredible. We're way ahead of everybody in that and other things.\n\n(01:28:25)As a result of the exciting renewal of the spirit of our armed forces, and that's what it is, it's really reaching its spirit unprecedented heights. Over the past eight months, new enlistments, I'm so proud of this, have surged to record highs, the highest we've ever had. And we used to have recruiting shortages. If you remember about a year and a half ago, I was at the beginning stage of a campaign and things came out that you couldn't get people to join the armed forces. And by the way, the police also, the fire department. I always put the fire department in because they're great. They're great, and I got 95% of their vote too, that helps. When you get 95% of their vote, you always have to mention them, but they're great. And they're brave.\n\n(01:29:14)In our inner cities, which we're going to be talking about because it's a big part of war now, it's a big part of war. But the firemen go up in ladders and you have people shooting at them while they're up in ladders. I don't even know if anybody heard that but, and I said, don't talk about it much, but I think you have to. Our firemen are incredible. They're up in one of these ladders that goes way up to the sky, rescuing people, and you have animals shooting at them. Shooting bullets of firemen that are way up in death territory. You fall off that ladder, it's over, it's over. They don't even have to inspect you when you hit the ground. And you have people shooting bullets at them in some of these inner cities. We're not going to let that happen. So, I always mention the firemen because that's actually a big\n\nDonald Trump (01:30:00):\n\nBig problem we have. They're unbelievable. Like you, they're unbelievable people. For the first time on record in 2025, the Navy, Air Force and Space Force all met or surpassed their recruiting goals three months early. That never happened before. And the Army did even better. Congratulations, Army. They met everything. And these were the highest standards because we're making it larger. So these were much higher standards than you had four years ago, three years ago during the Sleepy Joe Biden era. And the Army did it four months early. And you remember a year and a half ago they said the big stories that were way behind with the Army, Air Force, the Navy, the Marines were way behind, Coast Guard and even Space Force. I love Space Force because that was my creation. When you create something, I love it. And the people we put in there were good.\n\n(01:30:58)I got that right. We put in great people initially and we've really dominated. We really dominate in that sphere now. We were way behind China and Russia and now we dominate. Space Force turned out to be a very important thing. I said from the beginning when Biden came into office, he wanted to terminate it. He said, \"And this thing called Space Force, so we could get rid of that.\" And he got hammered by the people in this room for even suggesting it because it's very important, one of the most important. And as time goes by, it'll get more and more important. But we're now at 106% of our recruiting targets for the year, and that's the best in far more than a generation. And for the Marines, morale is so strong that the Marine Corps will meet its 2026 retention targets before the end of October, which never happens. And that's the earliest it's ever happened in the history of our country.\n\n(01:31:56)And it makes you feel good. I felt guilty. I'd go make a speech in front of never people like you, you are the leaders, but people, soldiers. And I felt embarrassed because there'd be stories about we couldn't fill up our Army, Navy, Air Force. We couldn't fill them up. And it was headlines, his headlines. It was during Biden's four years, the autopen. I call him the autopen. How would you like to have your things signed by an autopen? When I have a general and I have to sign for a general because we have beautiful paper, they're gorgeous paper, I said, \"There're a little more gold on it. They deserve it.\" I want the A paper, not the D paper. We used to sign on piece of garbage. I said, \"This man's going to be a general, right? I don't want to use this. I want to use the big beautiful firm paper.\"\n\n(01:32:52)I want to use the real gold writing when you talk about the position and they're beautiful, but how would you like to have that where some kid sitting in the back office is having it signed with an autopen? I thought about it and I thought about you people first, admirals, generals. And I said, \"Somebody works his whole life. He gets into maybe the academies or wherever, but however you got there and you go through years of work and now you become an admiral or a general or whatever. And when you do, the President of the United States signs your commission as you know. And that commission is beautifully displayed and I signed it. Actually, I love my signature. I really do. Everyone loves my signature. But I signed it very proudly.\n\n(01:33:43)I always think to myself, \"How can you have an autopen sign this? It's just so disrespectful to me. It's just totally disrespectful.\" It turned out that almost everything he did was signed by autopen except for what he gave his son, Hunter, a pardon. He signed that one. And that's actually the worst signature I've ever seen. That was so bad. The autopen looks much better. But as leaders, our commitment to every patriot who put on the uniform is to ensure that American military remains the most lethal and dominant on the planet, not merely for a few years, but for the decades and generations to come, for centuries. We must be so strong that no nation will dare challenge us, so powerful that no enemy will dare threaten us, and so capable that no adversary can even think about beating us. And we've had it recently.\n\n(01:34:36)India and Pakistan were going at it and I called them both. And in this case, I used trade, \"I'm not going to trade with you.\" Two nuclear nations, big nuclear, \"No, no, no, you cannot do that.\" I said, \"Yes, I can. You go into this freaking war that I'm hearing about.\" Actually they just shut down seven planes. Seven planes. It was starting. It was a lot of bad blood. And I said, \" You do this, there's not going to be any trade.\" And I stopped the worst. It was going, it was raging for four days, but that was just the beginning and we stopped it. It was a great thing. And the Prime Minister of Pakistan was here along with the field marshal who's a very important guy in Pakistan. And he was here three days ago and I didn't even realize it as beautiful as he said it, but he said to a group of people that were with us, two generals, but a group.\n\n(01:35:32)He said, \"This man saved millions of lives because he saved the war from going on and that war was going to get very bad, very, very bad. President Trump saved millions and millions of lives. That was a bad war.\" And I was very honored. I loved the way he said it. Susie Wiles was there. She said that was the most beautiful thing. But we saved a lot of them, saved a lot of them. Even in Africa, we saved the Congo with Rwanda. They've been fighting for 31 years, 10 million people dead. I got that one done and very proud of it. So if this works out, we'll have eight, eight in eight months. That's pretty good. Nobody's ever done that. Will you get the Nobel Prize? Absolutely not. They'll give it to some guy that didn't do a damn thing. They'll give it to a guy that wrote a book about the mind of Donald Trump and what it took to solve the war.\n\n(01:36:35)The Nobel Prize will go to a writer now, but let's see what happens. But it will be a big insult to our country. I will tell you that. I don't want it. I want the country to get it, but it should get it because there's never been anything like it. Think of it. So if this happens, I think it will. I don't say that lightly because I know more about deals than anybody. This is what my whole life was based on. And they can change, and this can certainly change, but we have just about everybody, we have one signature that we need and that signature will pay in hell if they don't sign. I hope they sign for their own good and we create something really great. But to have done eight of them is just such an honor.\n\n(01:37:20)And then we have Putin and Zelensky, the easiest one of them all. I said, \"That one I'll get done.\" I thought that was going to be first. The other was much harder. Some of them. Azerbaijan, this was going on for 36 years. They said, \"It's not solvable, sir. You can't. Don't do it.\" I said, \"I will do it. I will do it.\" And I got on the phone with the two countries. They were great. They were great. I knew immediately, I knew as soon as I started talking to them, we're going to solve that war and we did. Now they're so happy. Now they're friends. One said he's been president for 32 years, 22 years. He said, \"For 22 years I did nothing but kill his people.\" They were in the room together at the Oval Office and they started off spread like this at the beautiful resolute desk.\n\n(01:38:10)And one was here and one was here. You couldn't get further away. That's the furthest I've ever seen two people in front of me. And as the hour went by, they got closer, closer, closer. And at the end of the hour we had it done and they hugged and hugged and hugged. And I said, \"That's so nice and you're going to remain friends.\" And I spoke to them, one of them the other day, he said, \"No, he's now my friend.\" But for 22 years he's been the head of Azerbaijan for 22 years. And the other guy's great guy too, seven. And that war, that was a war that was not solvable. He said, \"For seven years,\" the other one said, \"for 22 years, all I did was kill his people. That's all I've done.\" I sand, \"Well, we're going to put a stop to that.\" So we solved that. So it's a great thing. It's a great feeling. You're saving Kosovo and Serbia. You're saving so many lives doing this if you can do it. But our people deserve nothing less than the very best and we'll never going to let them down. And if we can solve wars instead of you having to fight wars, wouldn't that be wonderful, right? Wouldn't that be wonderful? That's why one of the first executive orders I signed upon taking office was to restore the principle of merit. That's the most important word, other than the word tariff. I love tariffs, most beautiful word, but I'm not allowed to say that anymore. I said tariff is my favorite word. I love the word tariff. We're becoming rich as hell. We have a big case in front of the Supreme Court, but I can't imagine, because this is what other nations have done to us and we have great legal grounds, but you still have a case. It would be very bad if something happened.\n\n(01:39:57)But I said, \"My favorite word in the English dictionary is the word tariff.\" And people thought that was strange and the fake news came over and they really hit me hard on it. They said, \"What about love? What about religion? What about God? What about wife, family?\" I got killed when I said tariff is my favorite word. So I changed. It's now my fifth favorite word and I'm okay with that. I'm okay with that. But they hit me hard. But it is, I mean, when you look at... We've taken in trillions of dollars, we're rich. Rich again, and there'll never be, when we finish this out, there'll never be any wealth like what we have. Other countries were taking advantage of us for years and years. You know that better than anybody. And now we're treating them fairly, but the money coming in is we've never seen anything like it.\n\n(01:40:52)The other day they had 31 billion that they found, $31 billion. So we found $31 billion and we're not sure from where it came. A gentleman came in, a financial guy. I said, \"Well, what does that mean?\" He said, \"We don't know where it came.\" I said, \"Check the tariff shelf.\" \"No sir, the tariffs haven't started in that sector yet.\" I said, \"Yes, they have. They started seven weeks ago. Check it.\" Comes back 20 minutes later, \"Sir, you're right. It came from tariffs.\" 31 billion. That's enough to buy a lot of battleships, admiral, to use an old term. But I think we should maybe start thinking about battleships, by the way. We have a secretary of the Navy came to me because I look at the Iowa out in California and I look at different ships in the old pictures. I used to watch Victory at Sea. I love Victory at sea.\n\n(01:41:47)Look at these admirals. It's got to be your all-time fave, in black and white. When I look at those ships, they came the destroyers alongside of them, and man, nothing was going to stop... They were 20 deep and they were in a straight line and there was nothing going to stop them. And we actually talk about those ships. Some people would say, \"No, that's old technology.\" I don't know. I don't think it's old technology when you look at those guns, but it's something we're actually considering, the concept of battleship, nice six-inch side solid steel, not aluminum. Aluminum that melts if it looks at a missile coming at it. It starts melting as the missile's about two miles away. Now those ships, they don't make them that way anymore, but you look at it. And your secretary likes it and I'm sort of open to it and bullets are a lot less expensive than missiles.\n\n(01:42:38)A lot of reasons. I should take a vote, but I'm afraid to take that vote because I may get voted out on that one, but I tell you, it's something we're seriously considering. They were powers. They were big powers. They were just about as mean and scary as you could be. And so we'll look into that. One of the biggest cases that we won was the decision of the United States Supreme Court to allow us to proceed on the word merit. Merit. So those two words are right up there. So this is, I would say, the opposite if you ask for a definition, the opposite of political correctness. We went through political correct, where you had to have people that were totally unfit to be doing what you're doing. For many reasons, I won't get into them, but for many reasons they were unfit. Now it's all based on merit.\n\n(01:43:37)That was such an unbelievable decision. I didn't expect we were going to win that one. We went in, we said we needed it. We went in for colleges where kids with a C average are getting into the best colleges and the kids with A averages won't get in. And kids with the highest boards and the highest marks or the best marks couldn't get into the best schools and people that had not good boards and not very good marks, I mean okay, but nothing special, they were getting into our best colleges. I said, \"This is just crazy. You can't run a country like this.\" And it was lingering for years and it got to the Supreme Court and we won that decision. Merit, everything's based on merit. You're all based on merit. We're not going to have somebody taking your place for political reasons because they are politically correct and you're not.\n\n(01:44:31)We take the people that are going to do the best job. That's all, it's very simple. And that's the way our country was built. We were built on merit. We got away from it for a long time and everyone understands it, and it was done. It was approved. I give great credit to the Supreme Court because I thought they had tremendous courage. I didn't think they'd do that. That was tremendous. I give, maybe for that decision, almost more than anything because it's a hard decision to make. It's really hard. The apparatus of our country was not set up for merit. It was set up for political correctness, and you can never be great if you're going to do that. And we're going to be greater than we ever were before. We're bringing back a focus on fitness, ability, character and strength.\n\n(01:45:21)And it's because the purposes of military is not to protect anyone's feelings. It's to protect our republic, and it's the republic that we dearly love. It's to protect our country. We'll not be politically correct when it comes to defending American freedom. And we will be a fighting and winning machine. We want to fight, we want to win, and we want to fight as little as possible. You have to count on people like me to keep you out of wars because we don't want to go into wars. Many of the wars that I just told you about, we could have entered those wars and settled them in a different way, lose a lot of our troops, and we could have settled them, I guess differently. Maybe not, actually. Actually you might not have been able to settle them. We just would've been in the middle of a lot of firepower.\n\n(01:46:10)But when we do need it, you're going to be so ready and you know it. But very importantly, with that goal in mind, I've committed to spending over $1 trillion on our military in 2026. And that's the most in the history of our country, $1 trillion. That's a lot of money. I hope you like that ma'ams and sirs. I hope you like it. That's a hell of a lot of money. We have the best of everything. Every branch is seeing major investments. And as I announced in the Oval Office in March, we are rapidly moving forward with the first ever sixth generation fighter jet. I didn't name it. I did not name it. Boeing came in and they said, \"Sir, this is our submittal. It's the greatest fighting jet ever done.\" And they're testing all these plans, all the companies are testing, and this one tested through the roof.\n\n(01:47:08)And they said, \"We'd like to name it the F-47.\" I said, \"Let me think about it.\" Then after thinking for about two seconds, I said, \"Okay, that means 47.\" I'm 47, so I'm 45, 46 and 47, yeah, if you think about it, I just don't want the credit for 46. I don't want to have their open borders and people coming in from all over the world, including jails and mental institutes. I don't want that on my record, but I like having it. We're investing tens of billions of dollars in modernizing our nuclear deterrence capabilities like never before. And we've begun construction on what we call the Golden Dome Missile Defense Shield. It'll be the most sophisticated in the world. You watched it do well until they had some problems at the end with a little bit of a lack of ammunition, defensive ammunition, but they've got that taken care of.\n\n(01:48:08)But I tell you, what we're doing is so good and we deserve it. We help other countries with it. We don't have it ourselves. And Canada called me a couple of weeks ago, they want to be part of it, to which I said, \"Well, why don't you just join our country and become 51, become the 51st state, and you get it for free?\" So I don't know if that made a big impact, but it does make a lot of sense. It actually because they're having a hard time up there in Canada now because as you know with tariffs, everyone's coming into our country. We have more investment than we've ever had before. $17 trillion coming in. As an example, in four years, Biden didn't have 1 trillion. We have 17 trillion more than that in eight months coming in.\n\n(01:48:56)And they're coming in from Canada, Mexico, from Europe, from all over, AI, auto plants. Everybody's coming back to the United States. Under my budget, we will be expanding the U.S. Navy by at least 19 ships next year, including submarines, destroyers, assault ships and more. And it's going to be much more than that as we go along, because we basically don't build ships anymore. We do build submarines, but we don't build ships. Did you know, in the Second World War, they were freighters and different types, but we were doing a ship a day and now we don't do ships. And I'm not a fan of some of the ships you do. I'm a very aesthetic person and I don't like some of the ships you're doing aesthetically.\n\n(01:49:41)They say, \"Oh, it's stealth.\" I say, \"That's not stealth. An ugly ship is not necessary in order to say you're stealth.\" By the way, the B-2 bombers were incredible. That is stealth. They went into that. I was with General Cain and Pete were in the we call it the war room, but we're watching them go in and they were totally untouched. They were not seen. They were literally not seen. They dropped their bombs, they hit, every single one of them hit its target. It was total obliteration. CNN, when we came back, fake news CNN, oh, their camera just went off. You know their camera. Every time I mention, they turn the camera off because it's never good. They say, \"This is a problem.\" But I don't blame them. You're better off keeping it off.\n\n(01:50:28)But they have some scammer reporter who started saying without any knowledge that he may not have hit the targets as well as they thought. It may not been obliteration. He did hit the targets and I got to give us a little credit, right? It was obliteration, it turned out. The Atomic Energy Commission said it was obliterated. Not only did they hit the target, they had these chutes. And think of this here, way up in the sky, there was no moon. It was dead dark. You couldn't see a thing. You couldn't see them. But they had I guess a beam going right into these chutes. Every single one of those bombs went right down those chutes into a granite mountain. I think it's the last time they're going to build air chutes. They had these air chutes that were nice, beautiful. They were meant for us, but it was total obliteration. And now they give us credit for that.\n\n(01:51:21)But these people were phenomenal. I tell you, for the Air Force people here, you can be very proud. That B-2, we just ordered a lot of new ones. New ones and updated ones. But I'd take the other ones. Let me tell you, they couldn't have worked any better. So they flew for 37 hours total back and forth, no stops, no nothing. We had 52 tankers loading them up. And that's a job I wouldn't necessarily want too much, flying a tanker loaded up with hundreds of thousands of gallons of fuel. I don't know if I'd do that job. I asked the question, \"What happens if it gets hit?\" \" Sir, you don't want know about that.\" Right? I don't want to know about that. But those guys, they just hear us. They're incredible. I had them all to the Oval Office.\n\n(01:52:08)We had the B-2 pilots and a lot of the people, even the people that took care of them, the maintenance people, just as important, we had them all to the White House, gave them a big party on the lawn, brought some of them into the Oval Office. But on top of all this, we'll deliver a hard-earned pay raise of 3.8% to every soldier, sailor, airman, Coastguardsman, Space guardman, and Marine, something you weren't getting from the past administration, they did not treat you with respect. They're Democrats. They never do. Not only are we rebuilding our great strength, but for the first time in years, my administration is actually using that strength to defend the core and vital interests of America. And very simply, we are putting America first. And I have, since I've been elected, I've always put America first. It's sort of simple when you think.\n\n(01:52:59)My campaign was run on common sense, and we did great. We've got the highest numbers ever received in terms of districts. They have it broken up, 2,500 versus 525. We won every swing state. We won the popular vote. We won everything. We won everything. You have to take a look at the map. It's almost entirely red except there's a little blue line on each coast, and I think that's going to disappear too. We did really great. And part of it is because of our success with the military, the rebuilding of the military, the vote that I got from the military, and the vicious people that we have to fight, just like you have to fight vicious people. Mine are a different kind of vicious, but they spread all these horrible... They made up statements and said what I said about everything, but even about the military.\n\n(01:53:53)But fortunately, the military didn't believe it. It's hard. They make up a statement and they said you say it. We had 25 people that said, \"He never said that.\" 25. We had 25 affidavits. And they said, \"Well, we're going with it anyway.\" These sleazebags. And that's why the press is really losing all power because people aren't believing it. We need an honest press. We need borders. We need borders. We need an honest press. We need fair elections. I mean, those three things, and we don't have an honest press. We have a really corrupt press, but we fight through the corrupt press and the people understand you have to do this stuff a lot. You have to go on television a lot because you can't get a fair shake if you're going to rely on somebody else.\n\n(01:54:34)They don't understand. They've destroyed... The image of media now is that the lowest point it's ever been. It's lower than Congress. Can you believe that? It's something. But together with many of you in the room, we've brought back the fundamental principle that defending the homeland is the military's first and most important priority. That's what it is. Only in recent decades did politicians somehow come to believe that our job is to police the far reaches of Kenya and Somalia while America is under invasion from within. We're under invasion from within. No different than a foreign enemy, but more difficult in many ways because they don't wear uniforms. At least when they're wearing a uniform, you can take them out. These people don't have uniforms. But we are under invasion from within. We're stopping it very quickly.\n\n(01:55:29)After spending trillions of dollars defending the borders of foreign countries, with your help we're defending the borders of our country from now on. We're not going to let this happen. Biden let people come in from prisons, mental institutions, drug dealers, murderers. We had 11,488 murderers allowed into our country by this guy who had no clue. He had no clue. He shouldn't have been there in the first place, but he had no clue. The people that ran the office, the White House, were people that surrounded him, radical left lunatics that are brilliant people, but dumb as hell when it came to policy and common sense. And they allowed people from all over the world, from the Congo, they opened up prisons in the Congo. They came into our country, totally unmatched, unvetted, unchecked, and from all over South America, not just South America, you think South America, no. But from all over.\n\n(01:56:36)A lot came in from Venezuela. Venezuela emptied its prison population into our country. That's why they have Tren de Aragua, one of the worst gangs ever. But we took care of them. We took good strong care of them. And I just want to thank the National Guard in Washington, D.C. It's embarrassing to say this. Now, I can't say it because we solved it, but Washington, D.C. was the most unsafe, most dangerous city in the United States of America, and to a large extent beyond and beyond that. You go to Afghanistan, they didn't have anything like that. You go to countries that you would think there's problems, they didn't have that. And now Washington, D.C., after 12 days of serious, serious intensity, we took out 1,700 career criminals.\n\n(01:57:28)If you have five career criminals, they can make your numbers look very bad because they'll commit many crimes a day. But we took out 1,700 and they took them out. There was no doubt who the boss was. They did an unbelievable job. Then they started even cleaning. I said, \"I don't want them doing that.\" \"sir, they were cleaning it up. \"I drove through it two days ago. It was beautiful. People are walking down the street holding hands, man and wife, coming from Iowa. They're not worried about being shot. Washington, D.C. is now a safe city. In fact, I went out to dinner with my crew. I haven't done that. In theory, I wouldn't do it. And I felt totally safe. And nobody's been attacked. Nobody's been hurt. Washington, D.C. went from our most unsafe city to just about our safest city in a period of a month. We had it under control in 12 days, but give us another 15, 16 days, it's perfect.\n\n(01:58:26)And people other than politicians, that looked bad, they think. The Democrats run most of the cities that are in bad shape. We have many cities in great shape too, by the way. I want you to know that. But it seems that the ones that are run by the radical left Democrats, what they've done to San Francisco, Chicago, New York, Los Angeles, they're very unsafe places. And we're going to straighten them out one by one. And this is going to be a major part for some of the people in this room. That's a war too. It's a war from within. Controlling the physical territory of our border is essential to national security. We can't let these people in. We had no people enter in the last four months, zero. Even I can't believe that. We had millions coming in, pouring in. 25 million all told, and of those 25 million, many of them should never be in our country.\n\n(01:59:19)They would take their worst people and their people from prisons and jail, and they'd put them in a caravan and they'd walk up. CNN was interviewing one person, \"Oh, why are you coming?\" \" I want freedom.\" \"Good. Were you in jail?\" \"Yes.\" \"For what?\" \"Murder.\" You had to see this anchor, a young woman. She's like, \"I couldn't believe it.\" She'll probably lose her job, but because the left doesn't want to hear that. But we're running it based on common sense and based on love of our country. But I want to salute every service member who has helped us carry out this critical mission. It's really a very important mission. And I told Pete, \"\n\nDonald Trump (02:00:00):\n\nWe should use some of these dangerous cities as training grounds for our military national guard, but military. Because we're going into Chicago very soon. That's a big city with an incompetent governor, stupid governor, stupid. They threw him out of his family business. He was so stupid. I know the family. He becomes governor. He's got money. Not money that he made, but he ran for governor, he won. And now he criticizes us all the time. And last week they had 11 people murdered. 44 people shot. The week before that they had five people murdered. 28 people shot. Every weekend, they lose five, six. If they lose five, they're considering it a great week. They shouldn't lose any. You shouldn't lose any. This is civilization. And he's always up there saying, we're in very good shape. We don't need the military. No, they need the military desperately.\n\n(02:00:55)How about Portland? Portland, Oregon where it looks like a war zone. And I get a call from the liberal governor, sir, please don't come in. We don't need you. I said, well, unless they're playing false tapes, this look like World War II. Your place is burning down. I mean, you must be kidding. Sir, we have it under control. I said, you don't have it under control, governor, but I'll check it and I'll call you back. I called her back. I said, this place is a nightmare. It's probably certainly not the biggest, but it's one of the worst. It's brutal. They go after our I R people who are great patriots and tough job too. But they love it. They love it because cleaning up our country. And so you look at some of the things where they took over parts of Seattle, they actually took over a big percentage of Seattle.\n\n(02:01:50)Think of that. You remember that? That was a while ago. And I sent in the troops and they were gone as soon as I sent them in. Oh, when we sent in the troops. If you have a real leader that says you got to do what you have to do, I put that out the other day. You got to do what you got to do because we don't want our people hurt as they stand by. I was watching during Biden, they had troops standing up like this brave standing up in attention the way I should stand all the time. And they went like this. And people are standing, their mouth is this far away from their mouth and they're spitting at them, screaming at them. And that soldier standing there, he wants to knock the hell out of the person, but he's not allowed to do anything.\n\n(02:02:37)So they just stand there and they get abused. And a woman was this far away from his face and she starts spitting in his face and he's not allowed to do anything. If it's okay with you generals and admirals, I've taken that off. I say they spit, we hit. Is that okay? I think so. They spit. It's a new thing. They spit. We had... How about the cars? Where the cars are coming out. They get brand-new cars, border patrol, I R, beautiful, nice new cars and they're driving along and they have to go through a gauntlet of rocks being thrown at the car. So here's this beautiful brand-new car. By the time it goes a hundred yards, it's destroyed. These guys have pretty good arms, some of them, and they're throwing bricks at full force into the window and into the car. It looks like it's a war zone.\n\n(02:03:32)And I said, never let that happen again. From now on, if that ever happens, and I say it here, you get out of that car and you can do whatever the hell you want to do. Those people are... You can die from that. Those bricks go through the windows. You can die. They'd like it to. They'd like it to go through the window. But this was a couple of months ago. They just kept driving and bricks are hitting the car. And I said, why aren't they stopping? Because they were under orders from the past administration, never stop. But that's different with us. We stop. And since I gave that order, we haven't had that problem. It's very interesting. It's amazing. It's just like in Venezuela, you've seen the boats going. We can't find any more boats there. They're carrying drugs, massive. Every boat kills about 25,000 people.\n\n(02:04:20)That's what they have. They had fentanyl mostly and a lot of other drugs. And we take them out and we've taken out four. And it's on air. Everybody gets to see it. Not that we like to do that, but every boat kills 25,000 on average, 20... Some people say more. You see these boats, they're stacked up with bags of white powder. That's mostly fentanyl and other drugs do. And now we have a problem. General Keynes says, sir, there are no boats out there. Not even fishing boats. They don't want to go fishing. I don't blame them. There'll be no fishing today. But it's amazing what strength will do because all we want to do is stop drugs from flowing into our country. It's destroying... We lost 300,000 people died last year. Everybody knows friends. Many friends probably that you lost a child or adults too, but you lost a son or daughter because of what's coming into our border and we're making it very hard and we haven't even started yet.\n\n(02:05:25)Last month I signed an executive order to provide training for quick reaction force that can help quell civil disturbances. This is going to be a big thing for the people in this room because it's the enemy from within and we have to handle it before it gets out of control. It won't get out of control once you're involved at all. They all joke. They say, oh, this is not good. You saw it in Washington. We had gangs of Tren de Aragua with 10, 12, 15 kids. And these military guys walk up to them and they treat them with disrespect and they just got pounded. They just got pounded. The gang just pounded then thrown into paddy wagons and taken back to their country. Some are so dangerous, we don't want to even do that because we don't want... Some of stone cold murderers. We don't have the confidence even though they're not coming back very easily. We don't have the confidence we've put them in jails.\n\n(02:06:26)But these service members are following in a great and storied military tradition from protecting frontier communities to chasing outlaws and bandits in the wild west. And our history is filled with military heroes who took on all enemies, foreign and domestic. You know that phrase very well. That's what the oath says. Foreign and domestic. Well, we also have domestic. George Washington, Abraham Lincoln, Grover, Cleveland, George Bush and others all used the armed forces to keep domestic order in peace. Many of our leaders used the military to keep peace. Now they like to say, oh, you're not allowed to use the military. And you know what the people say? The people in those cities where they're being raped and shot and beat up. You know what they say? We love the military. Do you ever see where they interview the people on the street?\n\n(02:07:20)I've never seen somebody say they don't unless they're radical and paid off. Because a lot of these insurrectionists are paid by whether it's Soros or other people, but they're paid by the radical left. So today I want to thank every service member from general to private who has bravely helped us secure the nation's capital and make America safe for the American people. It's amazing. The whole world is watching. Everybody in the White House, they come up to me, young women, sir, thank you. I know immediately what they're thanking. They don't have to say it. They walk to work now through the White House. We haven't had a crime in Washington in so long because we got the careers, we call them the careers. We got these lunatics out and they'll never be any good. I hate to tell this to the liberal media. You could spend time with them, you could do whatever you want.\n\n(02:08:13)You could send them to the finest schools, which they couldn't get into anyway mentally. They couldn't get in. But no matter what you do, they'll never be good. They're bad. They're career criminals. I don't know, maybe they were born that way. Some people don't like me to say that, but maybe they were. Certainly some were. Together with the leaders here today we're also restoring a needed focus on defeating threats in the Western Hemisphere. Throughout this region, cartel terrorists have been allowed to wage a relentless campaign of death and destruction on our country. All because we had weak leadership on top and we did a great job with it first term. But this is something else what we're doing now, we're taking it to the next level, probably next level times three. But we had COVID come up and we had to take care of that.\n\n(02:09:03)We did a great job with COVID. We had the therapeutics, just Regeneron. So many things we did for COVID, but we had a focus on that and every other country in the world was being decimated by COVID. So we had to change gear a little bit to take care of that. But under our leadership, the military is now the knife's edge and combating the sinister enemy. We have to put the traffickers and cartels on notice. And we've done that and we put a lot of them, we've called them a terrorist organization, which is actually a big thing to do. Nobody's done it, but I've done it with a lot of them. It gives you a tremendous advantage. If you try to poison our people, we will blow you out of existence because that's the only language they really understand. That's why you don't see any more boats on the ocean.\n\n(02:09:55)You don't see any boats around Venezuela. There's nothing. As president, I will never hesitate to defend our people from threats of violence from the horrible plague that's taking place from within. The Iran nuclear power, the Iran, all of the great power that we thought existed, we blew it out to kingdom. We took advantage of it and we just really took advantage of it. And it was a beautiful thing to see. And that's what military power can achieve. That's why I chose Raising Cain. He's fantastic by the way. I hope you all agree. If anybody disagrees, could I please have your hand? Who disagrees that Raising Cain is no good. Just raise your hand. I don't see any hands raised. All right, that means you're okay. That means that he's okay now. But I saw his results. He took out ISIS. I was told it was going to take four years.\n\n(02:11:03)It took four weeks. I went to see him and he took them out in four weeks, knocked them out, knocked them to hell. And I was told by military people it was going to take four to five years to do it. And I don't even know if we'll have it then, sir. These were the Washington generals. I call them the television generals. But Raising Cain did it in four weeks, took out a 100% of the ISIS caliphate. As a result of these actions and many others since my inauguration we're witnessing the triumphant return of peace through strength. We have great peace through strength. America is respected again as a country. We were not respected with Biden. They looked at him falling downstairs every day, every day the guy's falling downstairs. He said, it's not our president. We can't have it. I'm very careful when I walk downstairs, I'm on stairs like these stairs.\n\n(02:11:57)I walk very slowly. Nobody has to set a record. Just try not to fall because it doesn't work out well. A few of our presidents have fallen and it became a part of their legacy. We don't want that. You walk nice and easy. You don't have to set any record, be cool, be cool when you walk down. But don't bop down the stairs. So one thing with Obama, I had zero respect for him as a president, but he would bop down those stairs. I've never seen him. Bop, bop, bop. He'd go down the stairs, wouldn't hold on. I said, it's great. I don't want to do it. I guess I could do it. But eventually bad things are going to happen and it only takes once. But he did a lousy job as president. A year ago, we were a dead country.\n\n(02:12:47)We were dead. This country was going to hell. We were dead in everywhere from immigration to military. We didn't have the weapons. We were giving everything to Ukraine. We had nothing. And by the way, I have to tell you now, as you know, I went over and I met with NATO. And NATO raised from two to five, which everyone said 5% of GDP, millions and now trillions of dollars are pouring in. They didn't pay the 2% because they know we were there to pay it. And now they paid the 5%. That's trillions of dollars and we're not spending any money on that war. Not 10 cents. We sell our equipment to NATO. NATO pays us for the equipment and they give it to Ukraine or whoever they give it to, but they can keep it. But we're not involved. We have no money going out.\n\n(02:13:38)Biden gave $350 billion, not sustainable, 350 billion and we have a war that should have never started, but we're not doing that anymore. So I just want you to know, we're selling equipment. Our people are buying equipment. They are buying the equipment at full price, a fair price. So I don't want to say we're making money because I don't want to say... I don't want to be making money on awards. Too many people dying. They're losing 7,000 soldiers a week. A lot of them are Russian soldiers, but between the two countries, mostly soldiers by the way. Sometimes in Kiev they'll lob a missile in or some drones and kill some people, but mostly it's soldiers. Russia and Ukraine are losing 7,000 souls. And they're not American, they're not us. They're not you or have a special obligation, but they're soldiers. They're young people.\n\n(02:14:35)They leave their parents, they wave goodbye, and then two days later they're blown up so unnecessarily. And so that's the primary reason I want to get it done. We got to get it done. It's crazy what's going on. That's the worst war that there's been since World War II. The number of soldiers that are being killed there is just crazy. From five to 7,000 soldiers die a week. Think of that. So I think we'll get that done, but that's turned out to be the toughest one. I'm so disappointed in President Putin. I thought he would get this thing over with. He should have had that war done in a week. And I said to him, you don't look good. You're four years fighting a war that should have taken a week. Are you a paper tiger? And it's a shame, but I think eventually we'll get that one done.\n\n(02:15:27)Just like in theory, I want to knock on wood, because you never know. It's like we're going to have the Middle East done, which is actually a much harder thing to do. I mean, thousands of years, but we have to get that war done. So now we're just think of it, we're a dead country. I was with the king of Saudi Arabia, great guy. I was with the Emir of Qatar. I was with the great leadership of UAE, I was over there. We brought back $2 trillion and more. They ordered 200 planes. They ordered so much and they were great. But they all said essentially the same thing. They said one year ago you were a dead country and now you're the hottest country anywhere in the world. We are. We're the hottest country in the world right now. The absolute hottest country in the world. There's nobody even close.\n\n(02:16:23)Putin said that to me. We met in Alaska, we had a good meeting. Then he went back and started sending drones into Kiev. I said, I thought we had a good meeting, but it's one of those things. But we were dead country a year ago and now we're the hottest country anywhere in the world. Think of that. You could be proud of that. And you must have felt like hell when you have a wife or a husband at home and you used to read the numbers that we can't get people to join the Army, Navy, air Force, Marines, Coast Guard.\n\n(02:16:59)You must have felt like I have a job that nobody wants. That doesn't feel good. Well, now you have a job that is brimming over with people wanting it. They want it and you're able to get a much higher quality because now you have your choice. You want so many and we're going to have many, many people that aren't going to be able to join because of the fact that we don't need them at this moment. But think of it, what a difference that is from I could just imagine two years ago, you're reading front page articles in the New York Times, of course, and Wall Street Journal, they always give us unfair stories, but they played it so big. They were playing it so big. Nobody wants to join the army, the Marines, the Air Force. They don't want to join. They don't want to join the Coast Guard at all.\n\n(02:17:50)Nobody wants to join. Nobody wants to join our forces. Our police forces also, it's almost went hand in hand. And I used to say, boy, I am speaking in front of the military today, and it's embarrassing because I'm speaking in front of people who have a job that other people don't want. But now you have a job that everybody wants. So I think that has to make you feel good. It's one of the reasons I love being here today because I wanted to say that. I have to say that. Everybody wants to be in the army, the Navy, the Air Force, the Marines. If you think the Coast Guard and Space Force, our beautiful Space Force, it's a whole different world. And now they're signing up. By the way, seriously, big numbers for the police. Dangerous job, isn't it? Fire department. But that's the paving the way for progress.\n\n(02:18:40)Once thought, almost impossible. I mean, a year ago you wouldn't have thought that was possible. A year ago they were talking about making the military smaller because they can't get the people to join. We're thinking about making it larger because we have so many people and it's nice to be able to cut people because of merit that aren't really qualified for any reason, a physical reason, a mental reason. You don't have to take them anymore because you have the pick of the litter and they all want to be with you. They all want your job. They want to be with you. They want to work with you. They'll even take your job, got to be a little bit sharp. You got to watch it. But everybody wants to be doing what you're doing now, what a difference. When I speak to you, and I can say that as opposed to a couple of years ago when I was talking to rooms where they were desperate to get people and they couldn't get them, what a difference a presidential election can make.\n\n(02:19:38)That's all it is. It's just a presidential election. Yesterday at the White House, we put forward a plan for peace in Gaza. We announced it and we're going to create something that was my idea, but unfortunately I got drafted. It's going to be called the Board of Peace and it's going to reign over that territory and we're going to get that done. And they asked if I'd be the chairman of the Board of Peace. I wasn't counting on that. I had the idea for the Board of Peace, but I said yes. And I guess because of that, every leader, everybody wants to be on the Board of Peace and we're going to watch over that very volatile part of the world and keep it non-volatile so you don't have to get involved. We want to save you for other things or save you for nothing from that standpoint.\n\n(02:20:26)We don't want you fighting wars, but if you have to, you're going to be... You're the most lethal fighting force in the world. And I would say that even two, three years ago. But now I say it with great enthusiasm. So true. And we're striving tirelessly to end the terrible war in Ukraine. And as you know, we're also working hard to get the allies to share more of the burden of our defense. Much of that has really already taken place. But all NATO members have committed to the increase that I talked about. Think of that. That was unthinkable. It used to be 1%. Then we got it up to two in my last term and they did not like it, and now I got it to five and I get along great with all of them. In fact, they call me the president of NATO. I said, I don't think so.\n\n(02:21:13)But they're great. They're great people and they're spending a lot of money and a lot of money that they should have been spending in the past, but I think Putin was a wake-up call for them really. We're now selling large quantities of American made weapons to NATO and we're getting really fair pricing. We're making a lot of money. It's my hope that from Europe to Asia to the Middle East, our allies will make similar commitments to increase their military capabilities and this will greatly strengthen our alliances and also it'll make war far less likely. If you're a strong presence like we are such a strong presence now. And I go around bragging about that. I said, we have the strongest military anywhere in the world. I say it. You never heard Biden say that, never heard him say anything, but you never heard him say, did you ever hear him say, we have the strongest military?\n\n(02:22:11)He doesn't say that. I say it. We have the strongest military anywhere in the world. We have great leadership and I'll tell you, Pete and General Cain, all of the people that I've met that have been lifted up in rank, and we got many of them out of here too, I'll be honest with you, didn't like doing it, but we got many of you out of here because we weren't satisfied. We know everything about everybody. It'll also help the United States rapidly rebuild our defense industrial base. Each of you can play an important part in getting allies to do their part.\n\n(02:22:45)So to that end, Secretary Hegseth will soon be announcing major reforms to streamline military acquisitions and expedite foreign military sales. We have tremendous numbers of countries that want to buy our equipment and in many cases it takes too long. They have backlogged. We're backlogged on all the equipment, which is something that's new to us a little bit, and I told those companies, you better get your ass going because we know we're buying... We're selling you a lot of equipment. We're getting countries to buy your equipment. You got to produce the equipment.\n\n(02:23:19)Some of the countries, I'm not going to mention, but some of the countries are buying a lot and that's a good thing. They're on our side 95%. I'll never say a 100% because they can always turn. You know about that, but they're on our side. The problem is we have to get the companies that make this equipment and we make the best equipment in the world, but they got to make it faster. We have orders for the F-35. We have orders for everything. The new F-47, we have orders for everything. They got to make it faster, a lot faster. Ammunition they have to make faster. In the coming months, we'll be making even more historic announcements to fully embrace the identity of the Department of War.\n\n(02:24:04)I love the name. I think it's so great. I think it stops wars. The Department of War is going to stop wars. If we are as ruthless and relentless as our enemies, the United States Armed Forces will be totally unmatched in the future. We have a group of enemies that are very ruthless and very smart, but they can't match us. They can't match us. They don't even come close to matching us. Again, it is very important for me to say we are the greatest military in the world, but we make the best equipment in the world. I watched our anti missile missiles. I watched our patriots just knock things out like a needle hitting another needle on the stage. There's a needle up there and you send another needle up and it hits it every time. During the war, we went 14 for 14, we had 14.\n\n(02:24:59)This is where I ran. We had 14 missiles coming at us, all 14 were knocked out of the sky. Every one of them. We make the best equipment. From Sparta to Rome to the British Empire, to the United States of America, history has shown that military supremacy has never been simply a matter of money or manpower. At the end of the day, it is the culture spirit of our military that truly sets us apart from any other nation. Our ultimate strength will always come from the fierce people and those brilliant people with such pride and the unbending will and the traditions of excellence that have made us the most unstoppable force ever to walk the face of the earth. And that's what we are. Remember, we never want to use it, but we have the most powerful nuclear capability, and I call it nuclear deterrent of any other country.\n\n(02:25:55)Nobody close. The men and women in this room inherit the legacy built and won by Washington and Jackson, Grant and Pershing, Eisenhower and Patton, Nimitz and LeMay. We carry forward the majestic military heritage passed down from father to son, soldier to soldier, and one generation of warriors to the next. You are warriors. You know that, right? You're great warriors or you wouldn't be in this room. You're the best of the best. From Concord Bridge to Fort McHenry, from Gettysburg to Manila Bay, from Normandy to Sicily, and from the jungles of Vietnam to the dusty streets of Baghdad, America's military has charged into hellfire, climbed up jagged mountains, crossed roaring oceans and thundered across open deserts to defend our flag, our freedom, and our homeland. Nobody does it like you. Now we are discovering American muscle, reasserting American might and beginning the next story chapter in American military legends and lore.\n\n(02:27:08)That is L-O-R-E. It is lore. When it comes to defending our way of life, nothing will slow us. No enemy will stop us. They cannot stop us, and no adversary will stand in our way. They won't stand in our way. We don't want them to stand in our way. We don't want to even put them in that position, but they're not going to stand in our way ever again. You'll never see four years like we had with Biden and that group of incompetent people that ran this country that should have never been there because we had the United States military, the best, the boldest, the bravest, that the world has ever seen, that the world has ever known. With leaders like we have right here in this beautiful room today, we will vanquish every danger and crush every threat to our freedom in every generation to come because we will fight, fight, fight, and we will win, win, win. I want to just thank you once again and God bless the United States military and God bless America. God bless you all. Thank you very much. Thank you.\n\n‍",

    "date": "",
    "transcript": "Speaker X (00:00):\n\nHello. [inaudible 00:00:13].\n\n(00:00)The big guns have arrived.\n\n(00:00)[inaudible 00:00:25].\n\nSpeaker 1 (04:26):\n\nLadies and gentlemen, the president of the United States and the prime minister of the State of Israel.\n\nDonald Trump (04:45):\n\nThank you very much, everybody. So, this is a big, big day, a beautiful day. Potentially, one of the great days ever in civilization. Things that have been going on for hundreds of years and thousands of years, we're going to, at least we're at a minimum very, very close, and I think we're beyond very close. And I want to thank Bibi for really getting in there and doing the job. We've worked well together, as we have with many other countries, both of us with many other countries, which is the only way this whole situation gets solved. And I'm not just talking about Gaza. Gaza's one thing, but we're talking about much beyond Gaza. The whole deal, everything getting solved. It's called peace in the Middle East.\n\n(05:40)So, today is a historic day for peace and Prime Minister Netanyahu and I have just concluded an important meeting on many vital issues. Including Iran, trade, the expansion of the Abraham Accords, and most importantly, we discussed how to end the war in Gaza, but it's just a part of the bigger picture, which is peace in the Middle East and let's call it eternal peace in the Middle East. So, this is far more than anybody expected, but the level of support that I've had from the nations in the Middle East and surrounding Israel and neighbors of Israel has been incredible, incredible. Every single one of them.\n\n(06:28)This afternoon, after extensive consultation with our friends and partners throughout the region, I'm formally releasing our principles for peace, which people have really liked, I must say. And these are done, not just routinely done, these are done with total consideration and working with the nations that we're talking about. All of these nations have made contributions to those suggestions.\n\n(06:57)I want to thank the leaders of many Arab and Muslim nations for their tremendous support in developing the proposal, along with many of our allies in Europe. Europe has been very much involved. And as I was called by many of the European leaders, most of them saying, \"Is this true? Are you really doing peace in the Middle East? This is the most incredible thing we've heard.\" Some think it's the biggest thing they've ever heard. They called just to find out, \"Was it just a rumor or is it actually done?\" And then they said, \"Have you spoken to the Arab leaders? Have you spoken to all of the other leaders? We have to get a lot of people involved in this one.\"\n\n(07:36)I also want to thank Prime Minister Netanyahu for agreeing to the plan and for trusting that if we work together, we can bring an end to the death and destruction that we've seen for so many years, decades, even centuries. And begin a new chapter of security, peace, and prosperity for the entire region.\n\n(07:56)And I want to just say that my meetings and dialogue that we had with so many countries, Saudi Arabia as an example, the king is a phenomenal person. The emir of Qatar, these are incredible people. UAE, and that's MBZ and ABZ were totally involved. These are the people that we've been dealing with and who've been actually very much involved in this negotiation, giving us ideas, things they can live with, things they can't live with. Pretty complex.\n\n(08:35)I mean, after 2,000, 3,000 years, whatever it is, I guess it's got to be a little complex, or it would've been done a long time ago. The king of Jordan was with us. As you know, in the United Nations, the president of Turkey, President Erdoğan, he's a friend of mine, strong man, but a good man. President of Indonesia, somebody who's an amazing leader, Prabowo. He is an amazing leader and respected by everybody. He was in the room with us. We were together with most of these people that I'm mentioning. Others were by phone or the next day.\n\n(09:19)The prime minister and the field marshal of Pakistan, they were with us right from the beginning. Incredible. In fact, they just put out a statement that they fully believe in this pact. It just came out just as I was walking around. They said, \"Sir, you have a big notice from the prime minister of Pakistan and from the field marshal, that they back this 100%.\" President el-Sisi of Egypt who's terrific. And these are people I've gotten to know over the years. I mean, I would say it started around 2015 and then went into 2016 when the presidency officially began, but I've known them actually for a long time. And there are many cases, really great. I can't say in all cases, but I will tell you, in many cases they're great men and some great women too. They tend to be mostly men, however, I will say that.\n\n(10:17)But if accepted by Hamas, this proposal calls for the release of all remaining hostages immediately, but in no case, more than 72 hours. So, the hostages are coming back. And I hate even saying this, from the standpoint, doesn't sound right, but it is so important to the parents, the bodies of the young men. I believe in almost all cases, the young men are coming back immediately. I met with parents. Their parents felt as strongly about getting the body of their dead boy back, as they did as though the boy were alive and well. It's so important to them, and it means the immediate end to the war itself, not just Gaza, it's the war itself.\n\n(11:15)Under the plan, Arab and Muslim countries have committed, and in writing in many cases, but I actually would take their word for it, the people I mentioned, I take their word for it, to demilitarize Gaza and that's quickly decommission the military capabilities of Hamas and all other terror organizations, do that immediately. And we're relying on the countries that I named and others to deal with Hamas. And I'm hearing that Hamas wants to get this done too, and that's a good thing. And destroy all terror infrastructure, including the tunnels, weapons production\n\nDonald Trump (12:00):\n\n… in facilities. They have a lot of production facilities that we're destroying. They'll also help train local police forces in the areas that we're discussing right now, in particular in and around Gaza, working with the new transitional authority in Gaza, all parties will agree on a timeline for Israeli forces to withdraw in phases. They'll be withdrawing in phases, no more shooting hopefully. As progress is made toward achieving these goals, Arab and Muslim nations need to be allowed the chance to fulfill these commitments of dealing with Hamas. They have to deal with them because they were the one group that we have not dealt with. I haven't dealt with them, but the Arab and Muslim countries are going to be dealing with Hamas, and I believe they've already been there. I think they probably have an understanding and they haven't maybe mentioned that, but I would imagine they do.\n\n(13:04)Otherwise, they wouldn't have gone as far as they've gone. If they're unable to do so, then Israel would have the absolute right and actually our full backing, the US full backing. Marco is here and a lot of our leaders are here. Our great vice president, Suzy Wiles, Steve Witkoff, Jared Kushner, they've been so involved in this process. I don't think anybody else could have done it or even come close, but we're right there. We're right there first time in thousands of years, I think, you can probably say if you really look into it. If you study back, if you're a scholar, you would say thousands of years Israel would have my full backing to finish the job of destroying the threat of Hamas. But I hope that we're going to have a deal for peace. And if Hamas rejects the deal, which is always possible, they're the only one left.\n\n(14:06)Everyone else has accepted it. But I have a feeling that we're going to have a positive answer. But if not, as you know, Bibi, you'd have more full backing to do what you would have to do. Everyone understands that the ultimate result must be the elimination of any danger posed in the region, and that danger is caused by Hamas. The tyranny of terror has to end. And this is again, something that we're looking for. This is eternity. This is forever. To ensure the success of this effort, my plan calls for the creation of a new international oversight body, the Board of Peace. We call it the Board of Peace, sort of a beautiful name, the Board of Peace, which will be headed not at my request, believe me, I'm very busy, but we have to make sure this works. The leaders of the Arab world and Israel and everybody involved asked me to do this.\n\n(15:13)So it would be headed by a gentleman known as President Donald J. Trump of the United States. That's what I want, is some extra work to do, but it's so important that I'm willing to do it and we'll do it right. And we're going to put leaders from other countries on and leaders that are very distinguished leaders, and we'll have a board. And one of the people that wants to be on the board is the UK former Prime Minister, Tony Blair. Good man, very good man. And some others. And they'll be named over the next few days and it'll be quite the board working. Everybody wants to be on it now. I don't know if that had anything to do. They named me and everybody else wanted to be on it. I guess they figured, \"Well, he's a soft touch. It'll be easy to deal with.\"\n\n(16:02)Working with the World Bank and others, it will be responsible for recruiting and training a new government that will be made up of Palestinians along with highly qualified experts from all around the world. Hamas and other terrorist factions will play no role in the board, but they'll play no role in the governance of Gaza at all, directly or indirectly. As you know, thousands of Hamas leaders have been killed and soldiers have been killed. And we can never forget October 7th, but thousands have paid the price for that. And now it's time to get our hostages back and get back to trying to bill something that's really great and very important. In our meeting today, prime Minister Netanyahu is very clear about his opposition to a Palestinian state. And he continuously mentions October 7th. And I understand that most people do, and I understand and respect his position on many things. But what he's doing today is so good for Israel.\n\n(17:14)I noticed that they have large crowds gathering in Israel all the time, and they have my name up, they like me for whatever reason, Bibi, I don't know, but they do like me. But they say two things, please get the hostages back and please end the war. They've had it. It's had it. So I think it's a very popular thing you do because he's a warrior. He doesn't know about getting back to a normal way of life. But he is a warrior and Israel's lucky to have him. But now the people want to get back to peace. They want to get back to normalization. In a true sense, several countries have foolishly recognized the Palestinian state. As you know, some of our European friends, allies, good people, but they're really, I think, doing that because they're very tired of what's going on for so many decades. They've been presidents and prime ministers for years and during this time having to do with the Middle East.\n\n(18:13)All they're doing is talking about the same thing over and over. They want to see it get back. And nobody wants that more than me, or I believe Bibi too. But the people of Israel want it. They really want it. They want the hostages back. That includes the probably 32 bodies that we're talking about, 20 people that are living, 32 or so people that are dead and they want to have peace. So let us not forget how we got here. Hamas was elected by the Palestinian people. Israel withdrew from Gaza thinking they would live in peace. Remember that long time ago, they withdrew. They said, \"You take it. This is our contribution to peace.\" But that didn't work out. That didn't work out. It was the opposite of peace. They pulled away. They let them have it. And I never forgot that because I said, \"It doesn't sound like a good deal to me,\" as a real estate person.\n\n(19:11)I mean, they gave up the ocean, right? Ron, they gave up the ocean. They said, \"Who would do this deal?\" And it still didn't work out. They were very generous actually. And they gave up the most magnificent piece of land in many ways in the Middle East. And they said, \"All we want to do now is have peace.\" And that request was not honored. Instead of building a better life for the Palestinians, Hamas diverted resources to build over 400 miles of tunnels and terror infrastructure, rocket production facilities, and hid their military command posts and launch sites in hospital, schools and mosques. So if you went after them, you'd be after them. And you wouldn't even realize you ended up knocking out a hospital or school or a mosque. That terrible thing. Terrible, terrible way to have to fight. No fight is good, but that's a real bad one. So there are many Palestinians who wish to live in peace.\n\n(20:10)Many, many, many, I've seen so many of them. And they have support. And I challenge the Palestinians to take responsibility for their destiny because that's what we're giving them. We're giving them responsibility for their destiny, fully condemn and prohibit terrorism and earn their way to a brighter future. They don't want the life that they've had. They've had a rough life with Hamas. If the Palestinian authority does not complete the reforms that I laid out in my vision for peace in 2020, they'll have only themselves to blame. We're giving them an amazing footprint, and they have amazing support from the leaders of the Arab world and the Muslim world, the great leaders. These are great leaders, these unbelievable leaders that have built great countries and very wealthy countries. What the future holds for the Palestinians, no one really knows. But the plan that we put forward today is focused on ending the war immediately, getting all of our hostages back, getting everything back.\n\n(21:15)Hard to believe when you even say it, and creating conditions for durable Israeli security and Palestinian success. Israeli security is going to be involved. We're going to help you. We'll be there with you in terms of helping with security. We want to make sure it works. We just want to make sure it works. There shouldn't be a shot fired. Now, there will be, I guess, because that's the way it seems to be. But they shouldn't have to be within a few days. They shouldn't have to be a shot fired and maybe for eternity. Wouldn't that be nice? I hope it's true. I can tell you the leadership of that region feels that there's a good chance of it being true. So this will lead to a disagreement that we're talking about will lead to a sustainable long-term piece. No president in history has been a greater friend of the state of Israel than I have. In addition to negotiating the Abraham Accords.\n\n(22:12)I like to say it that way because the real people, that's what they call Abraham. I would say Abraham, but it's so much nicer when you say Abraham. So much more elegant. But the Abraham Accords, they were amazing. Jared, you did that along with your group of geniuses and nobody thought that could be done. We have four countries and Sleepy Joe Biden didn't do a thing. He didn't even know what the hell they were. He should have had them filled up. But I think this will also lead to packing them. And who knows, maybe even Iran can get in there. We hope we're going to be able to get along with Iran. I think they're going to be open to it. I really believe that. But they could be a member. I long ago said, \"I'll bet you at some point Iran will be a member of the Accords.\" And little did I realize it was going to take this turn. That was some turn we did with the B2s.\n\n(23:12)But I think they might very well be there because it's a great thing for them economically. I recognized the eternal capital of Israel. I opened the American Embassy in Jerusalem. That was something that everyone said would never be done, could never be done. Virtually every president for many, many years, for decades would campaign on making Jerusalem the capital of Israel. They campaigned on it over and over. \"Is that right, Steve? Is that right?\" Everyone, and when they got to it, and I understand why now, because it was so when I got to office, I campaigned on it too, I said, \"We're going to make it.\" And then I'd get calls from the leaders of various countries saying, \"Please don't do it. Please don't do it. It'll end the whole world.\n\nDonald Trump (24:00):\n\n… please don't do it. And finally, I just didn't say anything, and I did it. People were calling me before I did it, because they heard I was going to do it. And leaders of countries were calling me. And I think it was on a Thursday that I did it. And they'd call me Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, three, four times a day. And I said, \"Tell them I'll call them back on Friday.\" And I announced it on Thursday. And I called them back, the biggest people in the world, and they said, \"You've done it.\" I said, \"Done what?\" \" You've made the capital of Israel, Jerusalem, and we wanted to talk.\" \"Oh, I wish you called me a little sooner. Maybe I could have done something about it.\" So that was a lot easier than getting into an argument. Because I knew what they were calling about. And you know what? It turned out to be amazing.\n\n(24:51)Everybody thought it was going to lead to the end of the world. The end of the world, Ron. That's what they said. You didn't lead to anything. It just led to something that I promised, and something that was very, very popular for Jewish people, and a lot of other people too. I recognized Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights, and I cut taxpayer funding to the corrupt United Nations Relief and Works Agency. And United Nations was interesting, because as you know, a few days ago, they introduced me, \"Ladies and gentlemen, the President of the United States.\" I'm looking at my teleprompter and the thing was dead, stone cold dead. The thing's up here, I have a long, beautiful speech to make. I'm back 30 feet back, and I'm saying, they're introducing me, there's nothing on my teleprompter. But I made a speech.\n\n(25:46)I actually got good marks. You think Biden could have done that? I don't think so. I don't think he could have done that. I don't think too many people could have done it. But actually, it was actually more of a speech from my heart. If you want to know the truth. I think it was maybe better in certain ways, because it was from the heart. It has to be from the heart, otherwise you're in big trouble. But I cut taxpayer payer funding for that very corrupt United Nations Relief and Works Agency, and nobody thought that would be done. And withdrew from the horrible Iran nuclear deal that was imposed upon Israel by Barack Hussein Obama and Biden. And I don't think Biden knew anything about it, though. I don't think he knows anything about it now, actually, if you ask him, he'd say, \"What is that?\"\n\n(26:36)And we obliterated Iran's nuclear enrichment capacity, making it impossible for them to have a nuclear weapon, which they would've had probably in about two months from that. But I've never asked Israel to compromise its security. But we had big strong talk. Nobody's been better to Israel. No president has been better to Israel than Donald Trump. But we had a long, strong talk, Bibi and I. And he understands it's time. It's time, history has shown, and the people of Israel want it. And the people of the Middle East want it. Enemies of Israel want it, but they don't have really too many enemies right now. And you know what? Many countries have gained great respect for Israel, for the way they fight, for the job they do, including me. I had respect anyway, but they gained respect.\n\n(27:26)History has shown us that those who have relations with Israel have thrived. While those who have devoted resources and attention toward the destruction and even annihilation of Israel have languished. They haven't done well. Israel is not going anywhere. They're going to coexist with other people in countries in the region, from Syria to Lebanon to Saudi Arabia. The promise of a new Middle East is so clearly within our reach. This is the closest we've ever come to real peace, not fake peace, not political fools peace. If we can get this difficult problem solved, the opportunities for all within that vast region of this world, it's a vast region. It's unlimited. The Abraham Accords show that all countries are better off when they communicate and work together and embrace new opportunities. I hope Jared and Steve and Suzy and Marco and J.D, we have great people, I hope you guys are going to work very hard to get these other countries in, because now they have no excuse. There's no longer an excuse. They were somewhat hesitant.\n\n(28:41)And I'll tell you the four countries that went in, I give them tremendous credit. And it's worked out incredibly well for them. In the same spirit, I'm pleased to report that earlier today we took another important step toward greater understanding of the region. A short time ago, we had a historic phone call in the Oval Office with Prime Minister Thani, who's really a great, great person. So we had a great talk. And I was on the phone, and Bibi was talking. Prime Minister Al Thani of Qatar. They really had a heart-to-heart conversation. It was a great conversation, I thought. It was productive. It was everything that you need to have something turn out to be successful. And I want to thank Bibi, and I want to thank the Prime Minister. That was fantastic. We agreed to launch a formal trilateral mechanism between Israel, Qatar, and the United States to begin a dialogue to enhance mutual security, correct misperceptions and avoid future misgivings.\n\n(29:48)And I want to thank Qatar, its leadership and the Emir is a fantastic person. I think I'm going to be his public relations man because I know him differently than a lot of people know him. But he wants peace. He wants to see peace. And his people, and they really acknowledge the critical role that they played as mediator. And again, we're not quite finished. We have to get Hamas, but I think they're going to be able to do that. So now it's time for Hamas to accept the terms of the plan that we've put forward today. And again, this is a different Hamas than we were dealing with, because I guess over 20,000 have been killed. Their leadership has been killed three times over. So you're really dealing with different people than we've been dealing with over the last four years, five years. Everyone has done their part and come to the table in good faith.\n\n(30:42)Our Arab and Muslim partners are fully prepared to step up and fulfill their commitments for the benefit of the people of Gaza and the entire region. They're willing to step up and do a lot. They really are. There are a lot of good people involved. Everybody who wants to see an end to the violence and destruction should be united in calling for Hamas to accept the extremely fair proposal, so that we can end the war, and get us back our hostages right now, and have everlasting peace. And I look forward to having relationships with everyone as the chairman of the board. I'll be involved, and we'll have meetings with some very smart people that'll be working over there to make sure that we haven't just been wasting time with an agreement that doesn't get done.\n\n(31:33)The task of building peace will not be easy. There are some of the hardest problems in the world to solve, and that's why it's been going on for so many centuries. But too many lives are at stake not to try. And this was more than a try. I mean, I think this is something that gets done when you have virtually every country. And these are powerful, powerful countries that have a lot of money and the money can make things happen. A lot of countries try and they don't have any money. These are very rich countries that can make things happen. So together we'll forge a much safer and more hopeful future for everybody, including Israel. And I want to thank Prime Minister Netanyahu for his partnership. And I want to thank all of the leaders, the kings and the emirs and the presidents and Prime ministers, people I mentioned, and they've been absolutely fantastic to work with.\n\n(32:30)And it's just happened very quickly. It's happened from a couple of weeks before the, I had a meeting, a couple of meetings, but a couple of weeks before we went to the United Nations, and we had some incredible meetings. It all came to place. It all took place, and everybody wanted to be a part of it. I don't have anybody that's saying we don't want anything to do with it. It's just the opposite. And I'll tell you a couple of years, a year ago, I don't think we would've had this kind of participation Mr. VP, right? I don't think we would've had. It's been amazing. The participation was 100%. Everybody wants to be a part of it. And everybody, those very strong countries, everybody wants to work. So Bibi, congratulations on this. I think this will be your crowning achievement, frankly, if this all works out, we think it will. It's going to be your crowning achievement. And I want to thank you very much for being here. Thank you. Please.\n\nBenjamin Netanyahu (33:26):\n\nThank you. Thank you. Mr. President, first I want thank you for graciously hosting me once again in the White House. And second, I want to thank you for your friendship and for your leadership. From Jerusalem to Tehran, from the Golan Heights to Gaza, you've proven time and again what I've said many times, you are the greatest friend that Israel has ever had in the White House. And Mr. President, you and I both know it's not even close. While you focus at home on making America great again, your leadership abroad is changing the world for the better, ending wars and advancing peace. I believe that today we're taking a critical step towards both ending the war in Gaza and setting the stage for dramatically advancing peace in the Middle East, and I think beyond the Middle East, in very important Muslim countries.\n\n(34:41)I support your plan to end the war in Gaza, which achieves our war aims. It will bring back to Israel all our hostages, dismantle Hamas's military capabilities, and its political rule, and ensure that Gaza never again poses a threat to Israel. We would not have achieved this turning point without the courage and sacrifice of our incredibly brave soldiers. They fight like lions to defend the people of Israel. And they serve on the front line in the war between civilization and barbarism. Mr. President, when our two countries stand shoulder to shoulder, we achieve the impossible. Just a few months ago in Operation Rising Lion and Operation Midnight Hammer, we struck a decisive blow against Iran's nuclear and ballistic missile program. Your bold decision to send those B-2s\n\nBenjamin Netanyahu (36:00):\n\n… Made the region safer and the world safer. Now, under your leadership, we're taking the next step to win the war and expand the peace. Your plan is consistent with the five principles my government set for the end of the war and the day after Hamas. Everybody asks, what is your plan for the day after Hamas? Here's our plan. Pass that in the cabinet. All our hostages, both those who are alive and those who died, all of them will return home immediately. Hamas will be disarmed, Gaza will be demilitarized. Israel will retain security responsibility, including a security perimeter, for the foreseeable future.\n\n(36:53)And lastly, Gaza will have a peaceful civilian administration that is run neither by Hamas nor by the Palestinian authority. If Hamas agrees to your plan, Mr. President, the first step will be a modest withdrawal followed by the release of all our hostages within 72 hours. The next step will be the establishment of an international body charged with fully disarming Hamas and demilitarizing Gaza.\n\n(37:25)I appreciate your willingness to lead the body, Mr. President. I really appreciate it because you have a lot of things to do, and this is important. And it reflects the confidence that this will give everyone that things will be followed up on all the commitments made. The fact that you are taking this on, I think helps a lot to make sure that everything flows in the direction that we want. Now, if this international body succeeds, we will have permanently ended the war. Israel will conduct further withdrawals linked to the extent of disarmament and demilitarization, but will remain in the security perimeter for the foreseeable future.\n\n(38:10)I think we should understand that we're giving everybody a chance to have this done peacefully, something that will achieve all our war objectives without any further bloodshed. But if Hamas rejects your plan, Mr. President, or if they supposedly accept it, and then basically do everything to counter it, then Israel will finish the job by itself. This can be done the easy way or it can be done the hard way, but it will be done. We prefer the easy way, but it has to be done.\n\n(38:55)All these goals must be achieved because we didn't fight this horrible fight, sacrifice the finest of our young men to have Hamas stay in Gaza and threaten us again and again and again with these horrific massacres. Mr. President, I was encouraged by your clear statement at the UN against the recognition of a Palestinian state. That would be an outcome that, after October 7th, would reward terrorists, undermine security and endanger Israel's very existence.\n\n(39:33)As for the Palestinian Authority, I appreciate your firm position that the PA could have no role whatsoever in Gaza without undergoing a radical and genuine transformation. In your 2020 peace plan, which you mentioned just now, you made clear what that transformation requires. It's not lip service, it's not checking a box. It's a fundamental, genuine, and enduring transformation. And that means ending paid to slay, changing the poisonous textbooks that teach hatred to Jews, to Palestinian children, stopping incitement in the media, ending lawfare against Israel at the ICC, the ICJ, recognizing the Jewish state and many, many other reforms.\n\n(40:26)It won't come as a surprise to you that the vast majority of Israelis have no faith that the PA leopard will change its spots. But rather than wait for this miraculous transformation, your plan provides a practical and realistic path forward for Gaza in the coming years in which Gaza will be administered neither by Hamas nor the Palestinian Authority, but by those committed to a genuine peace with Israel. I think this can be not only a new beginning for Gaza, I think it can be a new beginning for the entire region.\n\n(41:04)Under your leadership, we can re-energize… I've got to contribute my own. We can re-energize the Abraham Accords. That's what it's called in the original Hebrew, Abraham. Abraham is fine, Abraham, however you want to call it. Under your leadership, Mr. President, we can re-energize the Abraham Accords that we forged five years ago. We can expand them to many more Arab and Muslim nations that choose moderation over extremism. I think there's an opportunity here. It's not going to be easy. It's tough going, but I think if we succeed, you're absolutely right. We're going to open possibilities that nobody even dreamed of, but I think we dream of them.\n\n(41:50)As you've told me, Mr. President, and you've told the world many, many times, you said, \"Remember October 7th, remember October 7th,\" and we do. We will never forget the horrors of October 7th, and we will do whatever is necessary to make sure they don't happen again. Since October 7th, Israel's enemies have learned a hard truth. Those who attack us pay a heavy price, but those who partner with us advance progress and security for their peoples. President Trump just said it; it's also in the Bible. It says, \"Those who will bless you will be blessed, and those who will curse you will be cursed.\" And that's actually what is happening. We want the blessings. I think we've done a lot in the past two years to end the curse. We're not finished, but we've done a lot, and we've done a lot together to end the curse.\n\n(42:53)I want to thank your entire team for their efforts to get to this point. I especially want to thank Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner for their indefatigable work to bring Israel and Arab states and the region closer together. I am deeply grateful to both of them for their work. We had a phone call today just to make it clear. I said to the prime minister of Qatar, \"Israel was targeting terrorists. It wasn't targeting Qatar.\" And of course, we regretted the loss of the Qatari citizens. It wasn't our target. And I very much appreciate President Trump's proposal to have a trilateral body, the United States, Israel, and Qatar, to work out respective grievances. There are quite a few, but if we could try to mitigate them or put it on a different footing, I think that'll be good for everyone.\n\n(43:49)Above all, all the people, the fine team and many helpers who've done this, I want to thank you, Mr. President. History has already shown that under your leadership, Israel and America can change the face of the Middle East. And today, I'm hopeful that your plan to end the war in Gaza will do so again and do so soon. It will free our hostages, end Hamas' tyranny in Gaza, and enable a more secure and prosperous future for the peoples of our region.\n\n(44:25)Thank you, Mr. President. May God bless America. May God bless Israel. May God bless the indispensable alliance between our countries. And may I add in Hebrew, [foreign language 00:44:40]. May we all be inscribed in the Book of life. Thank you.\n\nDonald Trump (44:49):\n\nThank you very much, Bibi.\n\n(44:54)So I think while we wait for these documents to be signed and get everybody in line, I think it maybe is not really appropriate to take questions. I'm meeting with, as you know, a couple of Democrats in a little while about the country, about.keeping our country open. They're going to have to do some things because their ideas are not very good ones. They're very bad for our country. So we'll see how that works out.\n\n(45:22)But this is something that was really historic today. This was something that was amazing. I think, Bibi, I mean, depending on you, I think while we're waiting for signatures and waiting for approvals from a lot of different countries that are involved in this, we probably shouldn't take questions. Or would you like to take a question or two from perhaps a friendly Israeli reporter, if there's such a thing?\n\nBenjamin Netanyahu (45:48):\n\nThat's a very, very tough proposition.\n\nDonald Trump (45:51):\n\nYeah.\n\nBenjamin Netanyahu (45:52):\n\nBut I would think, Mr. President, that I would go by your instinct that this is… We'll have enough time for questions. Let's settle the issue first, I think, Donald.\n\nDonald Trump (46:00):\n\nI think so.\n\nPress Reporters (46:00):\n\n[inaudible 00:46:01]\n\nDonald Trump (46:00):\n\nThank you very much, everybody. Thank you.\n\nPress Reporters (46:00):\n\n[inaudible 00:46:06]\n\nDonald Trump (46:00):\n\nGood job. That was great.\n\nBenjamin Netanyahu (46:00):\n\nThank you.\n\nPress Reporters (46:00):\n\n[inaudible 00:46:26]\n\nSpeaker 2 (46:00):\n\nThank you, press.\n\nPress Reporters (46:00):\n\n[inaudible 00:46:38]",

    "transcript": "Donald Trump (00:00):\n\n… on Gaza with both the Middle East representatives and kings and all of the top leaders in the Middle East. And we had also a very good conversation with Bibi Netanyahu trying to get the hostages back. And we're trying to get the end of the Gaza situations really bad, very bad. And we think it could happen. Maybe it could happen pretty soon. We want the hostages back, we want the bodies back, and we want to have a peace in that region. So we had some very good talks.\n\n(00:35)As you know, I had President Erdogan here, Turkey, and we had a great meeting today. I think we had a meeting that was very conclusive in so many different things. Things that we wanted, things that he wanted, and that was good. We'll be announcing that sometime later and he'll be making an announcement too. But we had a great meeting with Turkey and their very respected president, and spent time. We had lunch and we had a lot of good discussions. So those two things. And we have some executive orders today to sign that are very important for the country. And we'll start off with one that's a proclamation. Want to do that, Will?\n\nSpeaker 1 (01:16):\n\nYes, sir. So today is Gold Star Mother's and Family's Day. This is an annual proclamation. This is to commemorate the fallen, those who have died for all of our freedoms and for our country and for their families who have suffered such grievous losses. But this is a proclamation commemorating Gold Star Mothers and Gold Star Family's.\n\nDonald Trump (01:37):\n\nYeah. And they're great people.\n\nSpeaker 1 (01:38):\n\nYes, sir.\n\nDonald Trump (01:40):\n\nIncredible people. What they've had to go through, very few people could have gone through this kind of thing. Gold Star. Okay? Thank you very much. I'll put it over here to you.\n\nSpeaker 1 (01:54):\n\nNext, sir, we have an executive order on TikTok. From the first days of your administration, you've charged a team from your administration led by Vice President Vance with ensuring that we can preserve TikTok as a platform for the 170 million Americans who use it while ensuring that their data is properly protected as required by law. With this executive order, you'll be effectively bringing into effect the agreement that will save TikTok and ensure that it can operate safely and securely.\n\nDonald Trump (02:22):\n\nSo this is interesting because I had a very good talk with President Xi. A lot of respect for him. Hopefully he has a lot of respect for me too. And we talked about TikTok and other things, but we talked about TikTok and he gave us the go ahead. It's run by American investors and American companies. Great ones, great investors, the biggest. You don't get bigger, I don't imagine. And maybe I'll ask JD. JD was very much involved and in charge of it. And maybe I'll have you say a few words about the deal. He would report back. And the points of the deal I think are great for our country. So, JD, do you want to give it a little talk, please?\n\nWill (03:04):\n\nYes, sir. So thank you, sir for your leadership and for your help. We really couldn't have done this without the president actually ushering this deal over the finish line. There was some resistance on the Chinese side, but the fundamental thing that we wanted to accomplish is that we wanted to keep TikTok operating, but we also wanted to make sure that we protected American's data privacy as required by law, both because it's the right thing to do, but also because it's a legal requirement of the law that was passed last year by Congress.\n\n(03:28)So we think that we were able to do that. Of course, we're going to keep on working at it, but this deal really does mean that Americans can use TikTok but actually use it with more confidence than they had in the past because their data's going to be secure and it's not going to be used as a propaganda weapon against our fellow citizens. We're very excited about it. We appreciate the cooperation of everybody involved and it's a big day.\n\nDonald Trump (03:50):\n\nAnd I think I can say that especially the young people, they really wanted this to happen. They did not want to have TikTok close. I got a little used to TikTok. I used it myself during the campaign and it was very successful because you know how I did with the young voter. And Charlie helped me a lot too, and he said to me, \"You should go on TikTok.\" And it actually had… Because we got record votes with the young voters for the election. So I was a little bit prejudiced in that way toward TikTok. It was very good and very meaningful. But we have American investors taking it over, running it, highly sophisticated, including Larry Ellison and Oracle I guess is going to play a very big role in terms of security, safety and everything else.\n\n(04:39)So we have very good controls. And literally I would get a call from friends of mine who are fathers of young people saying, \"Could you do me a favor? Could you get it approved, please? My son is driving me crazy.\" So we're getting it done and they have a big audience. We have great American investors and here's your final copy. TikTok. Maybe if you want, we could take a couple of questions in TikTok and then we're going to get onto something completely different, okay? Yeah, Jeff.\n\nSpeaker 2 (05:12):\n\nMr. President, Mr. Vice President, you mentioned that China was resistant. Can you describe where China is now? Are they fully on board with this?\n\nDonald Trump (05:17):\n\nThey're on board.\n\nSpeaker 2 (05:17):\n\nOr anything [inaudible 00:05:19]\n\nDonald Trump (05:18):\n\nI spoke with President Xi. We had a good talk. I told him what we were doing and he said, \"Go ahead with it.\"\n\nSpeaker 4 (05:25):\n\nOn the algorithm, it's still being leased coming from China. Are you satisfied that there's no security concerns for the [inaudible 00:05:33]\n\nDonald Trump (05:33):\n\nYeah, I really am.\n\nSpeaker 4 (05:34):\n\nIt would push disruptive [inaudible 00:05:35]\n\nDonald Trump (05:35):\n\nThe biggest reason is that it's owned by Americans and very sophisticated Americans. And people that love the country and very smart Americans too. So they don't want anything like that to happen. Yes, please.\n\nSpeaker 5 (05:48):\n\nThank you. Is there any operational relationship with Chinese entities or staff to execute the deal?\n\nDonald Trump (05:54):\n\nWith who?\n\nSpeaker 5 (05:55):\n\nWith the Chinese?\n\nDonald Trump (05:58):\n\nI don't think so. Not that I know of. This is going to be American-operated all the way and great respect for President Xi, and I very much appreciate that he approved the deal because to get it done properly, we really needed the support of China and the approval of China. Yes ma'am.\n\nSpeaker 3 (06:16):\n\nMr. President, now that Americans will have operational control, do you want to see the algorithm suggest more MAGA-related content prioritized more?\n\nDonald Trump (06:25):\n\nI always like MAGA-related. If I could, I'd make it a hundred percent MAGA-related. It's actually a good question, but if I could make it 100% MAGA I would, but it's not going to work out that way unfortunately. No, everyone is going to be treated fairly. Every group, every philosophy, every policy will be treated very fairly. Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 6 (06:49):\n\nMr. President, do you know the valuation? Do you know the American company's going to be valued in the billions?\n\nDonald Trump (06:53):\n\nWell, they valued it very highly. They're paying a big number. Do you want to talk, Scott? Do you want to say something about value?\n\nScott (07:00):\n\nWell, I'll let the vice president and then-\n\nDonald Trump (07:00):\n\nOkay, JD.\n\nScott (07:03):\n\n… I can follow-up.\n\nDonald Trump (07:03):\n\nYou'll say something?\n\nWill (07:04):\n\nSure. Well, first of all, I would say all credit goes to Secretary of the Treasury. Couldn't have got it done without Scott. Also couldn't have got it done without Sean Cooksey on my team. So thanks to them. The company will be valued around $14 billion. We actually think this is a good deal for investors, but ultimately the investors are going to make the determination about what they want to invest in and what they think is a proper value.\n\n(07:24)The most important thing is that it does protect American's data security and ensures TikTok is still accessible. And on this question of the algorithm, which we've heard this a lot, what this deal ensures is that the American entity and the American investors will actually control the algorithm. We don't want this used as a propaganda tool by any foreign government. We want to make sure that our people and our investors actually make these decisions based on what's good for their business as opposed to what's good for another government's propaganda arm.\n\n(07:52)So that's what we've done with this deal. I think it's very good for the American people. And as the president said, young people love this. We actually want everybody to access this whether they're MAGA or not, we just want it to be fair. We want it to be fair to everybody and we think that's what's going to happen with this new arrangement.\n\nSpeaker 6 (08:08):\n\nWill the US government… I'm sorry.\n\nScott (08:09):\n\nAnd just to follow-up on the vice president, there were two pieces to the transaction. The vice president's office has worked since the spring for the commercial transaction between the investor groups and then treasury and a group including the vice president's office were in Madrid two weeks ago to negotiate with the Chinese. And it was a result of President Trump's close relationship with Party Chair Xi that we were able to get this across the line.\n\n(08:35)We created a framework for Party Chair Xi to agree and then on the leader's call. Xi and President Trump discussed the final arrangement. So it was one, two, and that was the final piece.\n\nSpeaker 6 (08:53):\n\nWill the US government get any kind of annual payment as a result of this deal?\n\nDonald Trump (08:58):\n\nTaxes. It's going to make money and we're going to get a lot of money in taxes. China wanted to see this go. It is a great legacy for China too, and I thought President Xi was great in terms of his approval. We probably could have done it a different way, but it wouldn't have been the same. It wouldn't have been the same security at all. But I appreciated that he approved it.\n\nSpeaker 6 (09:22):\n\nSo aside from taxes, there's no part of the deal that is like a payment to the US government?\n\nDonald Trump (09:28):\n\nWell, we're going to be announcing different things, but the US comes out great. And I think China comes out great because they're going to have a very important legacy and they have many other deals. They have deals with us and they have deals in here in this country and they want to be treated fairly also.\n\nSpeaker 2 (09:45):\n\nMr. President and Mr. Vice President, the US company could change the algorithm to push different content? Is that…\n\nWill (09:52):\n\nThe US company will have control over how the algorithm pushes content to users. And that was a very important part of it. We thought it was necessary for the national security element of the law. We also just think it's important to protect American users. Again, we want users to use this platform the way they want to. We want the business to make decisions about content based on the interest of the business and based on the interest of the users. And that's what we think will happen with this new arrangement.\n\nDonald Trump (10:15):\n\nAnd they're paying a lot of money and I think hopefully it's going to be a great deal. They're very sophisticated people. You'll see a list. Have you seen a list yet of the people? Well, you've been reading about it.\n\nSpeaker 2 (10:24):\n\nThe reports, yeah.\n\nDonald Trump (10:26):\n\nI know Michael Dell is involved and Rupert Murdoch is involved. Let's see. We have probably four or five absolutely world-class investors that love the country and they made a lot of money with the country. Many of them are in a somewhat related business, so it works out pretty well. And they're going to be very careful about all of these questions that you've been asking.\n\nSpeaker 2 (10:52):\n\nWho else beyond Dell and Murdoch?\n\nWill (10:54):\n\nWell, it's a blue chip group of investors and we'll be announcing more about who exactly is involved in the deal in the days to come.\n\nDonald Trump (11:01):\n\nOracle is playing a very big part.\n\nWill (11:03):\n\nThat's right, sir.\n\nDonald Trump (11:03):\n\nAnd Oracle really understands this. And I think they're actually… And they've been involved for quite a while, running it for the people, the previous people. And so it's really… I think it's going to be very well protected. Very prestigious deal actually.\n\nWill (11:19):\n\nOn that Point, Mr. President… As the president said, Oracle has actually had a role in housing the data for a long time, even when the entity was controlled by the ByteDance organization in China. So Oracle had a pretty interesting perspective on what was necessary to actually create true data privacy protections for Americans. They were a very important part of getting this thing done.\n\nSpeaker 7 (11:40):\n\nMr. President, you've told us a couple of weeks ago, you thought that the security concerns were overrated, but were there legitimate concerns when it comes to safety?\n\nDonald Trump (11:48):\n\nFrom my standpoint, no, because the people that own it are… They're not China-centric, they're USA-centric and they're very smart people. I guess you could say it about everything. Everything is what's secure nowadays. Things that you think are totally secure turned out not to be, but I think in this case, it's going to be as secure as you could be because of the ownership and the people. And they have a big investment to their advantage to make sure it's good and safe. Anybody else? Do you have a question? No, behind you?\n\nSpeaker 8 (12:20):\n\nWell, I just want to say, do you think this move and getting this deal done, Mr. President, do you think this honors the legacy of charlie Kirk? You mentioned that he's specifically pushed you to get involved with TikTok and your campaign and helped you win young voters. Do you think this deal honors him?\n\nDonald Trump (12:34):\n\nWell, I think it's a good thing. It's a good sign. We're doing very well, as you know with the trade deals. We're doing very well with China and a lot of them. We were never treated properly. We were for four years actually, but we were never treated very properly by other countries and we're doing well. We've never done this well. Because of the tariffs that are coming in, the deals that are being made, $950 billion in one case. It's 950 billion where previously they paid nothing.\n\n(13:11)As you know, in Japan, it's 550 billion. South Korea is $350 billion now. That's up front. And one of the things I can say, I announced it lightly before, but we're taking in tremendous amounts of money with tariffs. We've never seen anything like it. No country has ever seen anything like it. I'm going to devote a little bit of that money, a little bit of the tariff money to our farmers. Our farmers have been incredible. They're the ones that let us survive and eat and enjoy our lives, right? Eat too much maybe in some cases like mine.\n\n(13:48)But I will tell you, we're going to take some of the tariff money. Relatively small amount, but a lot for the farmers. And we're going to help the farmers out a little bit because during this transition period where\n\nDonald Trump (14:00):\n\nWe're taking in incredible amounts of money. We'll have a little bit of a shortfall with the farmers until the tariffs kick in because they haven't kicked in for the farmers yet. And I decided before, and I spoke to all of the people here, that I want to make a contribution out of the tariff money, a small percentage of it, but it's a lot for the farmers, it'll make the farmers feel very good, just to help them through the transition. And ultimately, they're going to be making a fortune. They may be one of the top in the whole world in terms of a percentage gotten from the tariffs we're taking in. But we have so much coming in. It's a very small thing. But I want to let, in fact, just get the word out to the farmer because they'll be struggling until the transition's complete. Then after that, they're going to do, I think, better than they've ever done before. Last time I said get yourself a larger tractor and more land, and that was when they were doing very poorly, and they ended up doing that and they did very well.\n\n(15:05)That was with the deal we made with China. Unfortunately Biden forgot about the deal, then he never enforced. I enforced it until the end and China was very honorable. But when Biden came in, he didn't enforce it. When you don't enforce a deal, they don't do it so it was terrible. Biden was very bad to the farmers of our country. So we're going to be doing that. It's an honor to do it too. Brian, did you have a question?\n\nBrian (15:27):\n\nI just thought I'd say, what's your message to the millions of small businesses here in the U.S that really rely on TikTok to reach their end user, to market their service and their product?\n\nDonald Trump (15:36):\n\nWell, thank you for that question because honestly, we were getting hit up. They use it for virtual advertising and they paid very little for it and nothing for it, and small businesses have become very successful because of TikTok, and we didn't think of that. When everyone's saying, \"Oh, TikTok,\" And this and that, but over the last six months, I was called by so many people saying they're going to go out of business if they can't because they use it virtually as a advertising tool, and without it, they wouldn't have anything. They wouldn't be able to get the word out about their good product or whatever it is they're selling. So it's a very important thing for small business. It's another reason I wanted to do the deal so badly. So let's go to another subject now if we might, okay? And Will, please.\n\nWill (16:23):\n\nI want to ask you about the farmers.\n\nDonald Trump (16:23):\n\nYes, go ahead.\n\nWill (16:25):\n\nWhat does that look like? Is that going to be direct checks to farmers or is it going to be tax…\n\nDonald Trump (16:28):\n\nWell, we haven't decided that. We'll be dealing with Brooke later and the Secretary of Agriculture and we'll figure out how to get money to the farmers. And again, this comes out of the large amount, hundreds of billions of dollars of tariff money that's pouring into the country. The tariffs, remember when I said a long time ago, I said it's the greatest word, it's my favorite word in the world. Then I had to say… I was forced to say other things, of course rightfully so, love, family, religion, so I think I put tariff number five. I was forced because the fake news did a big number on me. It's one of those little things. But let's say it's my fifth favorite word, the word tariff. But it's making our country very rich. And when our country is rich, I'm able to help the farmers and I'm able to help even other countries that are in trouble, but we're able to help people that are in trouble. Medicaid, Medicare, social security, it's all a benefit of this tremendous amount. And I hear numbers coming in today, Scott, where the numbers were very high, right?\n\nScott (17:36):\n\nThe economic numbers were off the charts, sir.\n\nDonald Trump (17:38):\n\nUnfortunately, right? Because this is the only country in the world where you announce great numbers and the stock market goes down. Because when you announce great numbers, they immediately want to take that success away by raising the interest rates. Why can't they, you announce great numbers and let them lower the interest rate so you can make numbers… This is the only country in the world. I don't know if you heard, could you just tell them what the number was and how it was…\n\nScott (18:03):\n\n3.88% growth, the biggest in years. And the important thing is the president says this is going to be non-inflationary growth just like it was in its first term. So strong growth, low inflation, real wage gains. And to the question on small business, a small business optimism under President Trump last week hit a multi-year high, multi-year high. So small businesses, Main Street is back under President Trump.\n\nDonald Trump (18:36):\n\nBut isn't it crazy? So I saw the market was down a little bit today. I mean, in all fairness, I don't feel guilty because we've set every record you can imagine, but it was down and I say, \"Oh, the numbers must be good,\" Meaning the growth numbers are phenomenal. And again, this is during, but a little bit of pre the heavy, the really success and the money pouring into our country through the tariffs. And I just say, \"Why can't we have great numbers and lower the interest rates so we have even greater numbers?\" So people were saying, \"Oh, the numbers are so good, they're going to have to raise interest rates,\" That doesn't have to happen. And there's no inflation. The only thing we have is great success. We're having unbelievable success. So the numbers are much higher than anticipated except for by me and Scott and some of the other people. And they'll get a lot higher than that too. But I don't want to, every time we have good numbers, say, \"Let's take all the juice out by raising interest rates.\" It's so backwards. It's so backwards.\n\nScott (19:40):\n\nMr. President, they don't appreciate the importance of the third leg of your stool because trade taxes and deregulation allows for significant upside growth without inflation. So eventually the people at the Fed will be able to focus on this like Alan Greenspan did in the nineties. You can have strong growth and low inflation, and I think we can get the stock market up, Wall Street, Main Street, both doing well.\n\nDonald Trump (20:05):\n\nWe want low interest rates. There's no reason that every time we announce these record numbers… These numbers are way above projections by all the great geniuses out there. And I knew this was going to happen. So they had 71 different people and only two got it right, me and another gentleman from, I think, my wonderful Wharton School of Finance actually. So anyway. But I really want you to look at that, every time we have good numbers, they say this is a good time because they're guarding against inflation that may happen in two years from now. We have to change our thinking. We should be rewarded for good numbers, not penalized.\n\nWill (20:47):\n\nSo Mr. President, is that 3.8, is that the start of a 3% growth for the entire year?\n\nDonald Trump (20:52):\n\nYou know the number was projected at two because we're in a little bit of a transition period, but that transition period's ending faster than we thought on tariffs. The money coming in is much greater than people thought. And there's no inflation essentially. There's no inflation. We just went through the worst inflation in the history of our country under sleepy Joe Biden. He was sleeping and the inflation was really bad, worst ever. They say 48 years, I'll take that too, but I think it was probably the worst inflation we ever had because of spending and energy going through the roof and everything else. By the way, energy's way down. And you're going to really be impressed when you hear what happened today with President Erdogan of Turkey. I think it's great for both countries. I think it's great. We have great relationships with a lot of countries.\n\n(21:43)And you may be even more happy when you find out because we spoke with Bibi Netanyahu today and we spoke to all the leaders in the Middle East who were great people and we're getting pretty close to having a deal on Gaza, and maybe even peace, which would be the first time in about what? 2000 years, I think. In the region, I'd say the first in… Steve, what would you say? First in 2000 years or maybe 1000?\n\nSpeaker 10 (22:09):\n\nI would say so, Mr. President. Two millennium.\n\nDonald Trump (22:10):\n\nIt's a long time. Yeah, go ahead.\n\nSpeaker 9 (22:13):\n\nDid Erdogan agree to stop buying Russian oil? Did he…\n\nDonald Trump (22:16):\n\nI don't want say that, but if I want him to, he will. Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 9 (22:21):\n\nBut he didn't think that…\n\nDonald Trump (22:22):\n\nWell, I didn't say, \"Okay, you stop…\" But I believe he will stop it. Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 9 (22:27):\n\nDid you make a deal…\n\nDonald Trump (22:28):\n\nYou know why? Because he can buy from a lot of other people. He can buy from a lot of other people. You know who really can't is Hungary. Hungary's got… They're landlocked and they don't have a nice ocean where ships can sail in from all over the world. They have one pipeline coming. I spoke with… He's a great guy, he's a great friend of mine, but that's a harder one for them. And Slovakia too. They're sort of married to one pipeline. So I just don't want to have people go blaming them when… We spoke to them at length today, and it seems like for them it's a little… But that's… Yeah. Turkey has a lot of options. He's a great president and very smart man, and he's going to do what's right. But we had a very good conversation having to do with the purchase of military equipment, et cetera. Any other questions?\n\nSpeaker 9 (23:20):\n\nWould you be able to make a deal on F-35s, Mr. President?\n\nDonald Trump (23:23):\n\nFI will be able to easily if I want. So we may do that, yeah.\n\nSpeaker 9 (23:27):\n\nBut not yet.\n\nDonald Trump (23:28):\n\nWell, it depends. He's going to do something for us.\n\nSpeaker 10 (23:32):\n\nCan I ask you, we're a few days away…\n\nDonald Trump (23:35):\n\nBy the way, here we go with this guy. Go ahead, let's go. Let's hear the question.\n\nSpeaker 10 (23:39):\n\nA few days away from the end of the fiscal year and a potential shutdown…\n\nDonald Trump (23:42):\n\nRight.\n\nSpeaker 9 (23:42):\n\nThere going to be a government shutdown?\n\nDonald Trump (23:44):\n\nCould be, yeah, because the Democrats are crazed. They don't know what they're doing. They want to have the border opened up so that criminals can pour in. We're doing unbelievable borders closed, and people are coming into our country legally. They continue to want to have men and women's sports. They continue to want to have transgender for everyone. They want to raise everybody's taxes at a number that's not sustainable. It's the only time in the world I've ever seen a party that wants to raise taxes. I grew up in a family where I'd watch politics, and I always liked it from the time I was very young, but I'd always see politicians say, \"We will lower your taxes.\" These guys, they campaign on raising your taxes, but they want to raise taxes very substantially.\n\nSpeaker 10 (24:29):\n\nThe one thing they're concerned about… Look, Republicans have total control of Washington. You guys have control of the house, the Senate, [inaudible 00:24:35].\n\nDonald Trump (24:36):\n\nWell, when you say control, so we need 60 votes for this, and we have 53 Republicans, so we need seven Democrats.\n\nSpeaker 10 (24:44):\n\nAnd those seven Democrats and others are asking for an extension of a tax credit on people who get the Affordable Care Act and some other government-backed healthcare. So are you willing to negotiate…\n\nDonald Trump (24:55):\n\nWell, what they're really asking for is they want to pay for illegal aliens that have come into our country by the millions and get onto the roles and they want to pay, and our people don't want to do that. Our people are taxed enough. We just approved the largest tax decrease ever in the history of our country, including the extension of the previous Trump tax cuts. The tax cuts that we just approved, they want to use those tax cuts to give the money to illegal aliens, people that came into our country illegally and that are leaving the country. There's been a self-deportation because of what we've been doing. That's been incredible. Okay. Yeah, please.\n\nSpeaker 11 (25:35):\n\nSecretary Hegseth is inviting military leaders from all around the country on Tuesday. Will you also be there?\n\nDonald Trump (25:42):\n\nFrom all around the country to what?\n\nSpeaker 11 (25:44):\n\nFrom all around the world…\n\nSpeaker 9 (25:45):\n\nTo Virginia.\n\nSpeaker 11 (25:47):\n\nHe's inviting the generals and admirals to Virginia for a big meeting.\n\nDonald Trump (25:49):\n\nWell, I know. I love it. I mean, I think it's great. Let him be friendly. Let him be friendly with the generals and admirals from all over the world. Why, is there something… No, but is there something wrong with?\n\nBrian (26:00):\n\nWhat is it about… Will you be there personally as well? And what is it about…\n\nDonald Trump (26:02):\n\nWell, I'll be there if they want me, but why is that such a big deal? I mean, the fact that we're getting along with the generals and admirals from all… Remember, I'm the president of peace. It's good to get along. It's good. You act like this is a bad thing. Isn't it nice that people are coming from all over the world to be with us?\n\nWill (26:20):\n\nIt's not particularly unusual that generals who report to the Secretary of War and then to the President of the United States are coming to speak with the Secretary of War. It's actually not unusual at all, and I think it's odd that you guys have made it into such a big story.\n\nDonald Trump (26:32):\n\nIs it a big story?\n\nWill (26:33):\n\nI don't think it is, sir.\n\nDonald Trump (26:36):\n\nI would think it's… No, but isn't it a good story? We're respected from all over the world as a military force. I rebuilt the military during my first term, even though we gave a chunk of it away to Afghanistan. But we're talking Afghanistan too, by the way, about Bagram and about that. But that's a very small amount compared to what we rebuilt it by. But I rebuilt the military and we're very respected. We have the strongest military anywhere in the world, without question. We have the greatest equipment in the world. We're selling the equipment to other countries, and a lot of generals want to be here, and they want to look at… They're also going to be touring equipment sites. They're going to be talking about the newest weapons, et cetera, et cetera. But I think it's great when generals and top people want to come to the United States to be with our now-called Secretary of War. Does everybody like the name? I do.\n\nSpeaker 12 (27:34):\n\nYou said something really interesting this week about Ukraine, that you thought Ukraine could get back all the territory that Russia had taken.\n\nDonald Trump (27:37):\n\nYeah, they have a shot at it because Russia…\n\nSpeaker 12 (27:39):\n\nWhat prompted you to change your thoughts on that?\n\nDonald Trump (27:40):\n\nWell, because I've been watching the way Russia is and what Russia has been doing. I'm very dissatisfied with what Russia is doing and what President Putin is doing. I haven't liked it at all. He's killing people for no reason whatsoever. And they are doing very poorly considering\n\nDonald Trump (28:00):\n\n… they have put it all out on the line. Their economy is going to hell. They're bombing the hell out of everything, and they're picking up very little territory, if any. In fact, they're losing some territory. So, I think it's been very bad for the reputation of Russia.\n\n(28:18)This war should have been over. If this were our war, we would've had it over in one week and they're getting into fourth year, Jeff. They're getting into the fourth year now. Four-year of fighting and you see what they've taken. In the last month they've taken very little, and you've been reporting on all the bombing, all the drones all over the place, 900 drones coming into certain areas like Kyiv in one night. And with all of that work, they've taken over very little.\n\n(28:50)I'm very disappointed in President Putin. I thought … I solved seven wars. In fact, we have a great leader coming. We have the Prime Minister of Pakistan coming and the Field Marshal, Pakistan Field Marshal who's a very great guy. And so is the Prime Minister, both. And they're coming. And they may be in this room right now. I don't know because we're late. And I said maybe they'd like to join. They actually may be somewhere in the beautiful Oval Office. Yeah, please, behind you.\n\nSpeaker 14 (29:19):\n\nQuickly on Gaza. Did you promise leaders this week that you would not allow Israel to annex the West Bank? Is that something that you said-\n\nDonald Trump (29:24):\n\nI will not allow Israel to annex the West Bank. Nope. I will not allow it. It's not going to happen.\n\nSpeaker 14 (29:30):\n\nDid you speak with Netanyahu about this directly?\n\nDonald Trump (29:32):\n\nYeah. But I'm not going to allow it. Whether I spoke to him or not, I did, but I'm not allowing Israel to annex the West Bank. There's been enough. It's time to stop now, okay?\n\n(29:42)Yes, please.\n\nSpeaker 15 (29:43):\n\nJasmine Crockett recently-\n\nDonald Trump (29:44):\n\nJasmine Crockett. Jasmine … Remember what I said? Is she in relation to the late grade David Crockett? I don't think so. Jasmine Crockett, let me tell you before you even ask, she's a very low-IQ person. I mean, if we ever had to pass an aptitude test, that's the one should take one because she shouldn't even be in the … So I have no idea what you're going to, but I don't think we should waste our time. This is a low-IQ person who I can't even believe is a congressperson. Between her and Ilman Omar and the group.\n\n(30:18)You know, I met the head of Somalia. Did you know that? And I suggested that maybe he'd like to take her back and he didn't want. He said, \"I don't want her.\"\n\n(30:26)Okay. What else? Go ahead. Let's hear what Crockett said. Go ahead.\n\nSpeaker 15 (30:31):\n\nShe compared ICE raids to slave patrol. I want to ask you-\n\nDonald Trump (30:35):\n\nTo slave?\n\nSpeaker 15 (30:36):\n\nTo slave patrol. I want to ask you if you think that there should be consequences for members of Congress who make these types of comparisons or use this kind of language?\n\nDonald Trump (30:43):\n\nYeah. Well, I think she's gone over the line and I think a lot of the people … Look, the Democrats have become radical-left lunatics. They have policies that nobody's going to buy. And I see what's going on in New York. We're going to have perhaps a communist mayor because it's split up. If the people would get together and have one candidate, they'd have I think a pretty good chance, but it looks like maybe they're not going to do that, but we're going to end up with a communist mayor. It's not even believable, my beautiful New York.\n\n(31:13)When I left New York to become president, it was a great place, but it was the beginning of bad things because we had De Blasio had just started as mayor, and I said, \"This guy's a bad. This guy's a real nut job.\" Went to Harvard to teach management. Can you believe it? He went to Harvard to teach city management along with the mayor of Chicago who went to Harvard to teach. The two of them are teaching how to manage a city, and to manage it into hell is what they do. But that was the beginning. And now we're going to go a step further. Now we're going with the communist.\n\n(31:48)Can I be honest? I think it's the greatest thing to ever happen to the Republican Party. I really do. I think if a communist takes over New York City, I think that's a gift to the Republican Party. It's sad for New York, but it's a gift. And New York will recover because sometimes you need a shock like that to straighten you out. But politically, it's probably a very good thing.\n\nSpeaker 13 (32:11):\n\nMr. President, can I ask on immigration, crime and the World Cup, actually.\n\nDonald Trump (32:15):\n\nThat's a lot of questions.\n\nSpeaker 13 (32:17):\n\nYou have a number of cities that are pushing back against your immigration deportation move, as well as your crime initiatives. Some of those cities-\n\nDonald Trump (32:23):\n\nI don't think they're very much pushing back at all.\n\nSpeaker 13 (32:25):\n\nBut some of those cities have World Cup games, Seattle, San Francisco.\n\nDonald Trump (32:29):\n\nThey're going to be very secure.\n\nSpeaker 13 (32:32):\n\nSecure. But could those games move if they don't cooperate with your crime push?\n\nDonald Trump (32:35):\n\nWell, that's an interesting, I guess, but we're going to make sure they're safe. They're run by radical left lunatics and that don't know what they're doing.\n\n(32:43)Look at Washington DC. I just got numbers. There's like no crime in Washington DC. You, Jeff will not be mugged walking down the street. You can walk down the street with your family. You can walk down your street with your wife, your daughter, your son, and you're not going to be. We took out 1700 career criminals that we're not allowing back. And we have this city in great shape.\n\n(33:06)There was a time when every single, not long ago, when every single week you'd have at least one murder. And look what's happening with Washington. It's safe. I went to dinner in Washington just to prove a point. I gave a press conference in the middle of a street. I wouldn't say Secret Service was thrilled, but I did it. And here I am.\n\n(33:25)Look, Washington DC is such a great example of what can be done. We did it in 12 days. We made it very safe in 12 days, and now it's much safer than that.\n\n(33:38)One other thing, I drove around Washington over the weekend and I said, \"Look at the difference.\" The grass looked great. Everything looked great. We had a lot of our national guard and we didn't ask them to do it. They did it themselves. They're proud. They're great. And they were picking up paper. They were cleaning. The place looked really beautiful.\n\n(33:58)So we have a great Washington DC. We, as you probably know, we're going into Memphis and we're going into some other cities, and very soon we're going to go into Chicago. It will be safe for the World Cup. If I think it isn't safe, we'll move it into a different city. Absolutely. We'll take the World …\n\nSpeaker 16 (34:14):\n\nMr. President-\n\nDonald Trump (34:15):\n\nIf I think it's not, it's actually a very fair question. If I think it's not safe, we're going to move it out of that city. If like the governor of Illinois who was …\n\n(34:27)Look, last week, between last week and the week before 11 murders and 38 people were shot. Then he gets up and says, \"This is a very safe,\" and then he says, \"Crime is better.\" The reason crime is better is because Kash put about five months ago, a whole team of FBI people there to get ready for when we go in. And they've lowered it a little bit, like 20, 25%, which isn't good enough, but it's a good start. But that was only put there because they're preparing for us to go in. And they've done, by the way, they've done a good job.\n\n(35:02)So then Pritzker gets up, \"We've lowered crime 25.\" It's because the FBI was there. So no, if any city we think is going to be even a little bit dangerous for the World Cup or for the Olympics where they have Olympic overthrow, but for the World Cup in particular, 'cause they're playing in so many cities, we won't allow it to go to. We'll move it around a little bit, but I hope that's not going to happen. Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 16 (35:24):\n\nMr. President, Director Patel this morning indicated that the shooter in Dallas had been using an app to track ICE. Does your administration have any plans to take down those apps or get them removed or any-\n\nDonald Trump (35:37):\n\nWell, I can't tell you about that, but it tells you when they want to wear masks or they want to hide a little bit, why that's so important. But these are great patriots, the ICE, and what a tough job they have. What an unbelievably tough job they have.\n\n(35:54)And think of it, what are they doing? They're taking hardcore criminals out of our country and putting them back. These were largely criminals that were given to us by Joe Biden and his group of radical maniacs that surrounded this desk. Just like these people surround the desk now, but they're not maniacs. They're very solid people.\n\nSpeaker 17 (36:12):\n\nThank you, sir.\n\nDonald Trump (36:14):\n\nI'm glad I prefaced that. But they're great. We have a great cabinet. We have great people. And he didn't have great people. He had terrible people. Look at Afghanistan. Look at the people he had running our military that that could happen. The most embarrassing day in the history of our country was Afghanistan and 13 young people died. They don't ever talk about the 38 that were horribly wounded with legs and arms and everything else, really horribly wounded.\n\n(36:44)So the country's respected like it's probably almost never been respected before. I think we're respected at a level. And a year ago it was a dead country. We had a dead country a year ago. This country was dying. It was really in bad shape. Let's talk about the next subject, can we?\n\nSpeaker 1 (37:04):\n\nOne of the most powerful deterrents we have to violent crime is the death penalty. As you said, your administration has taken bold, decisive steps to ensure that Washington DC is once again a safe and secure city for its residents and all who visit. This is a presidential memorandum that directs your attorney general and your US attorney for the District of Columbia, Judge Jeanine Pirro, to fully implement the death penalty here in Washington DC, where the evidence in facts of a case indicate that the death penalty should be used.\n\nDonald Trump (37:35):\n\nOkay, everybody understand, death penalty in Washington, you kill somebody or if you kill a police officer, law enforcement officer, death penalty. And hopefully there won't be that. So again, it's way down. I mean, we have had week after week after week where we haven't had a murder. I said that the other day in front of the President of Poland. The press was here and I said, \" Ladies and gentlemen, I'd like to announce that Washington DC has not had a death in four weeks, a murder.\" And he looked at me, he goes, \"Is that good or bad?\" He's saying, \"What kind of a place is this?\"\n\n(38:13)But it's true. For years, I mean every week essentially somebody got killed or more than one. And this is a very safe city right now. We don't play games. And it's interesting. We took these careers out, career criminals. They call them careers. They left the word criminal out. But we took the careers out of here and they're now brought back to their homes, or they're in jail, or they're in a jail in another country, and hopefully they're not coming back. And we have to maintain it. You can't just leave and we have to maintain it. We've gotten along fairly well with the mayor. She's in a party that hates that the city's becoming safe. I mean, they're actually criticizing her because the city's becoming safe. But this is becoming a very … this is right now a very, very safe city. This is considered.\n\n(39:04)This went from the most unsafe city in the country to the safest city in the country. There's no city any safer. That's a pretty big achievement. And we really did it in 12 days. But if you add an extra week to it, that'd be nice.\n\n(39:19)I mean, you can go out to dinner. Restaurants are booming. The restaurants were dead. They were dead. Even if you got to the restaurant, then somebody would come in and hold you up. They'd hold up the whole restaurant. They go to Uber, young ladies in the White House, they'd call Uber for protection. They'd run to the car 'cause they were petrified to be from the entrance of their building to the car. Now they feel safe. They're in the car. And then the car gets hijacked while they're in the back of the car. This was what we were living in. We were living in hell.\n\n(39:49)People that work in the White House, every time they see me, young women in particular, they say, \"Thank you, sir.\" And I don't even ask them about what. I know exactly. I made their lives. Now they're living in a beautiful, glamorous place called Washington DC with no crime. And that's the way it should be. Okay?\n\n(40:06)This is the death penalty for somebody that kills people in Washington DC. I think it's capital. It's very interesting, capital punishment, capital city, right? It's capital. Capital, capital. But this is our capital city. We can't allow that to happen. People come in from Iowa to look at the Lincoln Memorial and they end up getting killed? It doesn't happen anymore. It's not going to happen. And if it does happen, it's the death penalty for the person that did it. And this goes into effect.\n\nSpeaker 1 (40:34):\n\nYes, sir.\n\nDonald Trump (40:34):\n\nRight? Pam, is that right?\n\nPam Bondi (40:36):\n\nYes, sir.\n\nDonald Trump (40:36):\n\nCould you speak a little bit about that?\n\nPam Bondi (40:38):\n\nYes, sir. Not only are we seeking it in Washington DC, but all over the country again. And as you saw very recently, we are now moving the inmates who were on death row, who Joe Biden or the autopen commuted their sentences off of death row, we're moving them to supermax facilities where they will be treated like they're on death row for the rest of their lives, President Trump.\n\nDonald Trump (40:59):\n\nOkay. That's a big statement. Thank you very much. Okay? I see some of you shaking your heads very positively. Thank you, Brian. Thank you, fellas.\n\nSpeaker 18 (41:07):\n\nYou said on the campaign trail that you-\n\nDonald Trump (41:09):\n\nI said it.\n\nSpeaker 18 (41:12):\n\nBefore the death penalty, if anybody, an illegal killed a US citizen or a police officer, so this just reinforces your campaign promises.\n\nDonald Trump (41:18):\n\nGood. And most people really like it. And Washington, again, it's going to serve as a beacon because you have to do it. These are bad people. When you look at that guy, the guy that killed the young lady in the train in North Carolina, that he'll be in trial for years and years, years. He'll get a good lawyer. Somewhere along the line, somebody will come along. And what he did to that young lady. And she went into that train scared. When she went in, the way she sat down, she was scared to just be there. She just wanted to not pay any attention to anybody, just not be noticed, and she had her\n\nDonald Trump (42:00):\n\n… throat slit, we don't want that in this country anymore. We're not going to have it in this country anymore. Thank you very much. Next.\n\nSpeaker 1 (42:09):\n\nLastly, sir, this is a presidential memorandum on countering domestic terrorism and organized political violence. In recent weeks, months and years, we've seen a tremendous upsurge in some highly visible, but also other acts of domestic terrorism and organized political violence being perpetrated by radical, politically-motivated groups all over the country. What this presidential memorandum will do is set off an administration-wide response to that, ranging from the Joint Terrorism Task Forces to other components of the Department of Justice, to the Department of Homeland Security and the Department of Treasury. We're looking at interdicting these groups, preventing them from performing acts of violence and also looking at sources of organization and funding and support that prop them up and allow them to do the acts that they have been doing.\n\nDonald Trump (42:57):\n\nWe're looking at the funders of a lot of these groups. And when you see the signs, and they're all beautiful signs made professionally, these aren't your protesters that make the sign in their basement late in the evening because they really believe it. These are anarchists and agitators, professional anarchists and agitators, and they get hired by wealthy people, some of whom I know, I guess, I probably know them. And you wouldn't know it. At dinner with them, everything's nice, and then you find out that they funded millions of dollars to these lunatics. Steve, could you say a couple of words to that, please?\n\nScott (43:32):\n\nYes, Mr. President. This is a very historic and significant day. This is the first time in American history that there is an All-of-Government effort to dismantle left-wing terrorism, to dismantle Antifa, to dismantle the organizations that have been carrying out these acts of political violence and terrorism. What we have seen, if you look at whether it be going back to the riots that started with Black Lives Matter and all the way through to the Antifa riots, the attacks on ICE officers, the doxing campaigns, and now the political assassinations, these are not lone isolated events. This is part of an organized campaign of radical left terrorism. It is structured, it is sophisticated. It is well-funded, it is well-planned. There is really no parallel like this to anything else in the country right now. There is a entire system of feeder organizations that provide money, resources, weapons.\n\n(44:22)And when they're attacking ICE officers, they're attacking federal buildings or they're isolating public officials for harassment, doxing, intimidation, and ultimately attempted assassination. It is all carefully planned, executed, and thought through. It is terrorism on our soil. Because of this executive order, Kash and Pam are going to have the tools they need working with Scott to take these organizations apart piece by piece. And the central hub of that effort is going to be the Joint Terrorism Task Force, or JTTF, which sits inside the Federal Bureau of Investigation. But for those at home who are worried about terrorism in this country, they need to understand because of President Trump's strength, because of his vision, because of his leadership, we are now going to use the entire force of the federal government to uproot these organizations root and branch. And again, that's only possible because of President Trump and his leadership.\n\nDonald Trump (45:09):\n\nThank you, Steve. Kash, please?\n\nKash Patel (45:11):\n\nYes. As Stephen was saying, Mr. President, thanks to your leadership, crime is going downward in a tremendous fashion, and that's what we want for every city in America. And the FBI's premier flagship enterprise, the Joint Terrorism Task Force, are honored to lead this initiative with our partners at Treasury and Homeland Security because our citizens are being attacked by, as Stephen said, organized violence and is being paid for not by them, by other people. So what we are going to do, combining forces, as Scott and I have done over these last few months is follow the money. People and organizations have collected funds and put them out into the streets of America and organized violence across our country.\n\n(45:48)And thanks to your recognition of this and this executive order and the AG's leadership to lead out and prosecute these individuals, we are properly going to chase them down like the domestic terrorists that they are, and our streets and our communities are going to be safer because the JTTF and the FBI and Treasury and DHS and DOJ are going to combine forces like never before to root out this new evil that is perpetuating our criminal activities across our societies. And we are just so thankful for your leadership and recognition of it.\n\nDonald Trump (46:16):\n\nThank you.\n\nKash Patel (46:16):\n\nIt's not easy to do.\n\nDonald Trump (46:17):\n\nGood job. Thank you very much. Dan?\n\nDan (46:19):\n\nWho specifically do you want to target?\n\nDonald Trump (46:21):\n\nWhat?\n\nDan (46:21):\n\nBesides Antifa, is there a specific group or person you're targeting with this?\n\nSpeaker 19 (46:26):\n\nAny organized group.\n\nDan (46:27):\n\nAny organized group?\n\nSpeaker 19 (46:29):\n\nAny organized group who are committing these crimes and we're working with the Secretary of Treasury. You know what law enforcement has told us under President Trump's leadership? He's taken the handcuffs off law enforcement. They can do their jobs now thanks to you, President Trump, and that's what's happening. And all of these agencies that Kash mentioned, we work hand-in-hand together. Our prosecutors were following the money with Treasury. We're working with Homeland Security. Kash's agents, all of our agents, DEA, ATF, U.S. Marshals combined are working and with state and local government to take these people off the streets who are jeopardizing lives. [inaudible 00:47:02]\n\nWill (47:02):\n\nCan I just illustrate this? So I was talking with Kash and Stephen about this couple of days ago, sir. So I believe it was in Oregon where you had a federal building where there were men in black ski masks who were committing acts of violence, who were shutting down a government building. To the President's point, they don't come from nowhere. These are paid people. This is organized. They're committing acts of political terrorism on American soil. And it's time we had a government that looked out for the American people rather than the people who are committing violence against the American people. [inaudible 00:47:30]\n\nDonald Trump (47:31):\n\nWhen you go out to Portland and you see what's happening in Portland, this is like, nobody's ever seen anything like it, every night… And this has gone on for years. They just burned the place down. And the shop owners, most of them have left, but the few shops that are open, they just use plywood and just like 3/4-inch plywood, they don't put storefronts in 'cause they know it's going to be burned down. These are professional agitators. These are bad people and they're paid a lot of money by rich people, some of whom we know. I'm sure I know some. If I knew I wouldn't associate because I'll be in trouble 'cause Pam will say, \"Why are you associating with this person?\"\n\n(48:08)But I will tell you that these are bad, bad people and they're paying a lot of money, millions of dollars. But take a look at Portland sometime, these are wild… These are crazy people and they're trying to burn down buildings, including federal buildings. And on my list of things that I want to do before we finish up with the cities, 'cause I think we're going to whip the cities back into shape, but we have to, we cannot let our cities… And that's a small example, but it's the most violent example. It's every night and they've done it for years. You'd think maybe at some point they made their point and what are they doing? But we're going to get out there and we're going to do a pretty big number on those people in Portland that are doing that. They're professional agitators and anarchists.\n\nWill (48:54):\n\nCould you name a few [inaudible 00:48:55]\n\nDonald Trump (48:54):\n\nThey're actually anarchists. Yeah.\n\nWill (48:56):\n\n… just so we can [inaudible 00:48:57]\n\nDonald Trump (48:56):\n\nGo ahead. What are you defending?\n\nWill (48:57):\n\n[inaudible 00:48:58]\n\nDonald Trump (48:58):\n\nWhat are you defending? Let's see you defend them, Jeff?\n\nWill (48:59):\n\nNo, I'm not defending anyone. So that we can explain this in our stories, could you name a couple of groups-\n\nDonald Trump (49:04):\n\nYou don't explain it right, though, Jeff. Go ahead.\n\nWill (49:06):\n\nMr. President [inaudible 00:49:07]\n\nDonald Trump (49:07):\n\nLet's go. Maybe let's give you another chance. Go ahead.\n\nKash Patel (49:09):\n\nAntifa? Soros? What names are we talking about?\n\nDonald Trump (49:12):\n\nWell, Soros is a name certainly that I keep hearing. I don't know, but Soros is the name that I hear. I hear a lot of different names. I hear names of some pretty rich people that are radical left people. Maybe I hear about a guy named Reid Hoffman. Somebody's a pretty rich guy, I guess, and I hear about him. I don't know, maybe… and maybe, could be him. Could be a lot of people. We hear the same names, but they're bad, and we're going to find out. And if they are funding these things, they're going to have some problems because they're agitators and they're anarchists. These are anarchists, really bad. Okay. Yeah, please.\n\nSarah Roderick (49:51):\n\nMr. President, can you [inaudible 00:49:52]. Mr. President-\n\nDonald Trump (49:52):\n\nWho are you with? Who are you with?\n\nSarah Roderick (49:54):\n\nI'm with The Center Square. Sarah Roderick is my name. As you know, Antifa is not just a domestic terror… or now a domestic terror organization. It's also international. I know the Netherlands is looking at also designating them a terror organization. Have you been working with your Intel community and your DNI to possibly expand that to making them… designating them-\n\nDonald Trump (50:16):\n\nYes, we have-\n\nSarah Roderick (50:16):\n\n… an international terror organization?\n\nDonald Trump (50:18):\n\nYep, we have been, yep. In many cases, it is international. Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 20 (50:22):\n\nMr. President, on Antifa, if someone takes to the streets of America and says they're Antifa, what happens to them? What will happen to them?\n\nDonald Trump (50:29):\n\nWell, I'd say the maximum under the law, and we'll see now. If they kill somebody, we just sign the death penalty, so it depends where it is. But if they kill somebody, which they do, people are dying, you go out to Portland, people die out there. Many people have died over the years in Portland. I don't know how anybody lives there. It's amazing, but it's anarchy out there and that's what they want. They want anarchy. Like when they attacked Seattle and took over a big percentage of the city, I was going to go out and we were going to do a big number. They heard that and everybody broke up all of a sudden. But you have governors that have to run that, and a lot of them don't do that.\n\n(51:07)I don't like to go in. I'd rather have Pritzker's support when we go into Chicago. But if we don't have it, that's okay too because we're paramount and we will do what we have to do. We're going to make Chicago safe. We're going to make as many as we can, and usually that involves a surge. In the case of Chicago, by having the FBI go out there five or six months ago, we brought it down a little bit. A little bit is 25%, so it's not so little, but it is when you're talking about the kind of crime and killings and murders that you hear in Chicago, but we're going to get it.\n\n(51:43)Chicago's a great city. As the Union Pacific said, the head of the Union Pacific, who's a great guy, started off as a low-rung guy, he said he started at a caboose and now he's the chairman of the Union Pacific. But he's a great guy. But he said, \"Sir, don't lose Chicago.\" The way he said it, I said, \"Boy…\" It really hit me. Here's a man that knows all the cities, the Union Pacific, I guess is our largest railroad and he knows all the cities. He's been doing it for 45 years. And he said, \"Sir, don't lose Chicago.\" And the way he said that meant a lot to me, and we're going to go into Chicago very soon. We're going to take care of Memphis. We're going to take care of Memphis. You can't walk a block without getting shot. We're going to take care of that one. And just like we did Washington, D.C., and we're going to do Chicago very soon. Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 21 (52:34):\n\nMr. President [inaudible 00:52:35] there could be an indictment on James Comey. Do you know if there is an indictment or [inaudible 00:52:42]-\n\nDonald Trump (52:41):\n\nI don't know.\n\nSpeaker 21 (52:42):\n\n… Mr. President?\n\nDonald Trump (52:43):\n\nI don't know. I know it's going on because I read the papers just like you do, right? So I don't know. Do you have anything to say about that?\n\nPam Bondi (52:48):\n\nWe can't comment on that. [inaudible 00:52:49]\n\nSpeaker 22 (52:54):\n\nMadam Attorney General, can you comment on a New York Times report saying that Justice Department officials have asked attorneys to target a George Soros-funded group, and is this executive order that you just signed a part of that effort?\n\nPam Bondi (53:04):\n\nI'm not going to comment on whether there is or is not a pending investigation, but everything's on the table right now.\n\nSpeaker 22 (53:10):\n\nWhat happens [inaudible 00:53:11]\n\nDonald Trump (53:11):\n\nI don't think anybody has to ask because if you look at Soros, he's at the top of every… In fact, sometimes I say, could he be involved in this many things? But he's in every story that I read, stories that I read, keep talking about Soros, and so I guess he'd be a likely candidate. Thank you very much, everybody.\n\nPam Bondi (53:34):\n\nThank you, guys. Thank you very much.\n\nDonald Trump (53:34):\n\nThank you very much.\n\nPam Bondi (53:34):\n\nThank you, guys.\n\nSpeaker 23 (53:34):\n\nThank you.\n\nPam Bondi (53:36):\n\nThanks, guys. Let's go. Let's go. Thank you. Thank you, guys. Let's go, let's go, let's go.\n\nSpeaker 23 (53:41):\n\nThank you, Brett.\n\nBrett (53:41):\n\nHello.\n\nPam Bondi (53:41):\n\nThank you, guys. Thank you. [inaudible 00:53:43]. Thank you, guys.",

    "date": "",
    "transcript": "Speaker 1 (00:02):\n\nThe Assembly will hear an address by His Excellency, Donald Trump, President of the United States of America. I request protocol to escort His Excellency and invite him to address the Assembly.\n\nUS President Donald Trump (00:27):\n\nThank you very much, very much appreciated. And I don't mind making the speech without a teleprompter, because the teleprompter is not working. I feel very happy to be up here with you nevertheless, and that way you speak more from the heart. I can only say that whoever's operating this teleprompter is in big trouble. Hello, Madam First Lady. Thank you very much for being here. Madam President, Mr. Secretary General, First Lady of the United States, distinguished delegates, ambassadors, and world leaders. Six years have passed since I last stood in this grand hall and addressed a world that was prosperous and at peace in my first term. Since that day, the guns of war have shattered the peace I forged on two continents. An era of calm and stability gave way to one of the great crises of our time. And here the United States, four years of weakness, lawlessness, and radicalism under the last administration delivered our nation into a repeated set of disasters. One year ago, our country was in deep trouble, but today, just eight months into my administration, we are the hottest country anywhere in the world and there is no other country even close. America is blessed with the strongest economy, the strongest borders, the strongest military, the strongest friendships, and the strongest spirit of any nation on the face of the earth.\n\n(02:53)This is indeed, the golden age of America. We are rapidly reversing the economic calamity we inherited from the previous administration, including ruinous price increases and record-setting inflation, inflation like we've never had before. Under my leadership, energy costs are down, gasoline prices are down, grocery prices are down, mortgage rates are down, and inflation has been defeated. The only thing that's up is the stock market, which just hit a record high. In fact, it hit a record high 48 times in the last short period of time. Growth is surging. Manufacturing is booming. The stock market, as I said, is doing better than it's ever done. And all of you in this room benefit by that, almost everybody. And importantly, workers wages are rising at the fastest pace in more than 60 years, and that's what it's all about, isn't it? In four years of President Biden, we had less than $1 trillion of new investment into the United States.\n\n(04:13)In just eight months since I took office, we have secured commitments and money already paid for $17 trillion. Think of it, four years, less than a trillion. Eight months, much more than $17 trillion is being invested in the United States, and it's now pouring in from all parts of the world. We've implemented the largest tax cuts in American history and the largest regulation cuts in American history, making this once and again, the best country on earth to do business. And many of the people in this room are investing in America, and it's turned out to be an awfully good investment during this eight month period. In my first term, I built the greatest economy in the history of the world. We had the best economy ever, history of the world, and I'm doing the same thing again, but this time it's actually much bigger and even better. The numbers far surpass my record-setting first term.\n\n(05:21)On our southern border, we have successfully repelled a colossal invasion. And for the last four months, and that's four months in a row, the number of illegal aliens admitted and entering our country has been zero. Hard to believe, because if you look back just a year ago, it was millions and millions of people pouring in from all over the world, from prisons, from mental institutions, drug dealers, all over the world they came, they just poured into our country with the ridiculous open-border policy of the Biden administration. Our message is very simple. If you come illegally into the United States, you're going to jail or you're going back to where you came from, or perhaps even further than that, you know what that means.\n\n(06:15)I want thank the country of El Salvador for the successful and professional job they've done in receiving and jailing so many criminals that entered our country, and it was under the previous administration that the number became record-setting, and they're all being taken out. We have no choice, and other countries have no choice because other countries are in the exact same situation with immigration. It's destroying your country and you have to do something about it. On the world stage, America is respected again like it has never been respected before. You think about two years ago, three years ago, four years ago, or one year ago, we were a laughingstock all over the world. At the NATO summit in June, virtually all NATO members formally committed to increased defense spending at my request from 2% to 5% of GDP, making our alliance far stronger and more powerful than it was ever before.\n\n(07:25)In May, I traveled to the Middle East to visit my friends and rebuild our partnerships in the Gulf, and those valued relationships with Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and the UAE and other countries are now, I believe, closer than ever before. My administration has negotiated one historic trade deal after another, including with the United Kingdom, the European Union, Japan, South Korea, Vietnam, Indonesia, the Philippines, Malaysia, and many, many others. Likewise, in a period of just seven months, I have ended seven unendable wars. They said they were unendable. You're never going to get them solved. Some were going for 31 years, two of them, 31, you think of it, 31 years. One was 36 years, one was 28 years. I ended seven wars. And in all cases, they were raging with countless thousands of people being killed. This includes Cambodia and Thailand, Kosovo and Serbia, the Congo and Rwanda, a vicious, violent war that was. Pakistan and India, Israel and Iran, Egypt and Ethiopia, and Armenia and Azerbaijan.\n\n(08:51)It included all of them. No president or prime minister. And for that matter, no other country has ever done anything close to that, and I did it in just seven months. It's never happened before. There's never been anything like that. Very honored to have done it. It's too bad that I had to do these things instead of the United Nations doing them. And sadly, in all cases, the United Nations did not even try to help in any of them. I ended seven wars, dealt with the leaders of each and every one of these countries, and never even received a phone call from the United Nations offering to help in finalizing the deal. All I got from the United Nations was an escalator that on the way up stopped right in the middle. If the First Lady wasn't in great shape, she would've fallen. But she's in great shape.\n\n(09:51)We're both in good shape, we both stood. And then a teleprompter that didn't work. These are the two things I got from the United Nations, a bad escalator and a bad teleprompter. Thank you very much. And by the way, it's working now. It just went on. Thank you. I think I should just do it the other way. It's easier. Thank you very much. I didn't think of it at the time because I was too busy working to save millions of lives, that is the saving and stopping of these wars, but later I realized that the United Nations wasn't there for us. They weren't there. I thought of it really after the fact, not during. Not during these negotiations, which were not easy. That being the case, what is the purpose of the United Nations? The UN is such tremendous potential. I've always said it. It has such tremendous, tremendous potential, but it's not even coming close to living up to that potential. For the most part, at least for now, all they seem to do is write a really strongly worded letter and then never follow that letter up.\n\n(11:05)It's empty words and empty words don't solve war. The only thing that solves war and wars is action. Now, after ending all of these wars and also earlier negotiating the Abraham Accords, which is a very big thing for which our country received no credit, never receives credit. Everyone says that I should get the Nobel Peace Prize for each one of these achievements, but for me, the real prize will be the sons and daughters who live to grow up with the mothers and fathers because millions of people are no longer being killed in endless and un-glorious wars. What I care about is not winning prizes. It's saving lives. We saved millions and millions of lives with the seven wars, and we have others that we're working on and you know that. Many years ago, a very successful real estate developer in New York, known as Donald J. Trump, I bid on the renovation and rebuilding of this very United Nations complex.\n\n(12:14)I remember it so well. I said at the time that I would do it for $500 million, rebuilding everything. It would be beautiful. I used to talk about, \"I'm going to give you marble floors, they're going to give you terrazzo.\" The best of everything. \"You're going to have mahogany walls, they're going to give you plastic.\" But they decided to go in another direction, which was much more expensive at the time, which actually produced a far inferior product. And I realized that they did not know what they were doing when it came to construction and that their building concepts were so wrong, and the product that they were proposing to build was so bad and so costly, it was going to cost them a fortune. And I said, \"And wait until you see the overruns.\" Well, I turned out to be right. They had massive cost overruns and spent between two and $4 billion on the building and did not even get the marble floors that I promised them.\n\n(13:15)You walk on terrazzo. Do you notice that? As far as I'm concerned, frankly, looking at the building and getting stuck on the escalator, they still haven't finished the job. They still haven't finished. That was years ago. The project was so corrupt that Congress actually asked me to testify before them on the tremendous waste of money because it turned out that they had no idea what it was, but they knew it was anywhere between two and $4 billion as opposed to 500 million with a guarantee, but they had no idea. And I said, \"It costs much more than $5 billion.\" Unfortunately, many things in the United Nations are happening just like that, but on an even much bigger scale, much, much bigger.\n\n(14:04)Very sad to see whether the UN can manage to play a productive role. I've come here today to offer the hand of American leadership and friendship to any nation in this assembly that is willing to join us in forging a safer, more prosperous world. And it's a world that we'll be much happier with. A dramatically better future is within our reach, but to get there, we must reject the failed approaches of the past and work together to confront some of the greatest threats in history. There is no more serious danger to our planet today than the most powerful and destructive weapons ever devised by man of which the United States, as you know, has many. Just as I did in my first term. I've made containing these\n\nUS President Donald Trump (15:00):\n\n... these threats a top priority, starting with a nation of Iran. My position is very simple, the world's number one sponsor of terror can never be allowed to possess the most dangerous weapon. That's why shortly after taking office, I sent the so-called Supreme Leader a letter making a generous offer. I extended a pledge of full cooperation in exchange for a suspension of Iran's nuclear program. The regime's answer was to continue their constant threats to their neighbors and US interests throughout the region and some great countries that are right nearby. Today, many of Iran's former military commanders, in fact, I can say almost all of them are no longer with us, they're dead. And three months ago in Operation Midnight Hammer seven American B-2 bombers dropped the 14 30,000 pound H-bombs on Iran's key nuclear facility totally obliterating everything. No other country on earth could have done what we did. No other country has the equipment to do what we did. We have the greatest weapons on earth. We hate to use them, but we did something that for 22 years people wanted to do.\n\n(16:25)With Iran's nuclear enrichment capacity demolished, I immediately brokered an end to the 12-day war, as it's called, between Israel and Iran, with both sides agreeing to fight no longer.\n\n(16:40)As everyone knows, I have also been deeply engaged in seeking a ceasefire in Gaza, we have to get that done, have to get it done. Unfortunately, Hamas has repeatedly rejected reasonable offers to make peace, and we can't forget October 7th, can we? Now, as if to encourage continued conflict, some of this body is seeking to unilaterally recognize a Palestinian state. The rewards would be too great for Hamas terrorists for their atrocities. This would be a reward for these horrible atrocities, including October 7th, even while they refuse to release the hostages or accept a ceasefire instead of giving to Hamas and giving so much because they've taken so much, they have taken so much, this could have been solved so long ago, but instead of giving in to Hamas ransom demands, those who want peace should be united with one message, release the hostages now. Just release the hostages now. Thank you.\n\n(18:03)As we have got to come together, and we will come together, got to get it done, we have to stop the war in Gaza immediately. We have to stop it. We have to get it done. We have to negotiate, immediately, have to negotiate peace. We got to get the hostages back. We want all 20 back. We don't want two and four. As you know, I got, along with Steve Witkoff and others that helped us, Marco Rubio, we got most of them back. We were involved in all of them, but I always said, the last 20 are going to be the hardest, and that's exactly what happened. We have to get them back now. We don't want to get back two and then another two and then one, and then three and have this process. No, we want them all back.\n\n(18:45)And we want the actually 38 dead bodies back too. Those parents came to me and they want them back, and they want them back very quickly and very badly, as though they were alive. They want them. They want them every bit as much as if their son or daughter were alive.\n\n(19:02)I've also been working relentlessly stopping the killing in Ukraine. I thought that would be, of the seven wars that I stopped, I thought that would be the easiest because of my relationship with President Putin, which had always been a good one. I thought that was going to be the easiest one. But in war, you never know what's going to happen. There are always lots of surprises, both good and bad. Everyone thought Russia would win this war in three days, but it didn't work out that way. It was supposed to be just a quick little skirmish. It's not making Russia look good, it's making them look bad.\n\n(19:43)No matter what happens from here on out, this was something that should have taken a matter of days, certainly less than a week, and they've been fighting for three and a half years and killing anywhere from 5 to 7,000, young soldiers, mostly, mostly soldiers on both sides, every single week from 5 to 7,000 dead young people. And some in cities, much smaller numbers where rockets are shot, where drones are dropped. This war would never have started if I were president. This was a war that should have never happened. It shows you what leadership is, what bad leadership can do to a country. Look what happened to the United States and look where we are right now in just a short period of time. The only question now is how many more lives will be needlessly lost on both sides.\n\n(20:40)China and India are the primary funders of the ongoing war by continuing to purchase Russian oil. But inexcusably, even NATO countries have not cut off much Russian energy and Russian energy products, which as you know, I found out about two weeks ago and I wasn't happy. Think of it, they're funding the war against themselves. Who the hell ever heard of that one? In the event that Russia is not ready to make a deal to end the war, then the United States is fully prepared to impose a very strong round of powerful tariffs, which would stop the bloodshed, I believe very quickly. But for those tariffs to be effective, European nations, all of you are gathered here right now, would have to join us in adopting the exact same measures. I mean, you're much closer to the city. We have an ocean in between, you're right there, and Europe has to step it up. They can't be doing what they're doing. They're buying oil and gas from Russia while they're fighting Russia.\n\n(21:51)It's embarrassing to them, and it was very embarrassing to them when I found out about it. I can tell you that. But they have to immediately cease all energy purchases from Russia. Otherwise, we're all wasting a lot of time. So I'm ready to discuss this. We're going to discuss it today with the European nations all gathered here. I'm sure they're thrilled to hear me speak about it, but that's the way it is. I like to speak my mind and speak the truth.\n\n(22:20)As we seek to reduce the threat of dangerous weapons today. I'm also calling on every nation to join us in ending the development of biological weapons once and for all, and biological is terrible and nuclear is even beyond, and we include nuclear in that. We want to have a cessation of the development of nuclear weapons. We know and I know and I get to view it all the time, \"Sir, would you like to see?\" And I look at weapons that are so powerful that we just can't ever use them. If we ever use them, the world literally might come to an end. There would be no United Nations to be talking about. There would be no nothing.\n\n(23:06)Just a few years ago, reckless experiments overseas gave us a devastating global pandemic, yet despite that worldwide catastrophe, many countries are continuing extremely risky research into bio-weapons and man-made pathogens. This is unbelievably dangerous. To prevent potential disasters I'm announcing today that my administration will lead a international effort to enforce biological weapons convention, which is going to be meeting with the top leaders of the world by pioneering an AI verification system that everyone can trust. Hopefully the UN can play a constructive role and it will also go, be one of the early projects under AI. Let's see how good it is because a lot of people saying it could be one of the great things ever, but it also can be dangerous, but it could be put to tremendous use and tremendous good, and this would be an example of that.\n\n(24:06)Not only is the UN not solving the problems it should, too often, it's actually creating new problems for us to solve. The best example is the number one political issue of our time, the crisis of uncontrolled migration. It's uncontrolled. Your countries are being ruined. The United Nations is funding an assault on Western countries and their borders. In 2024, the UN budgeted $372 million in cash assistance to support an estimated 624,000 migrants journeying into the United States. Think of that, the UN is supporting people that are illegally coming into the United States, and then we have to get them out. The UN also provided food, shelter, transportation, and debit cards to illegal aliens, can you believe that, on the way to infiltrate our southern border.\n\n(25:04)Millions of people came through that southern border. Just a year ago, millions and millions of people were pouring in, 25 million altogether over the four years of the incompetent Biden administration, and now we have it stopped. Totally stopped. In fact, they're not even coming anymore because they know they can't get through. But what took place is totally unacceptable. The UN is supposed to stop invasions, not create them and not finance them. In the United States, we reject the idea that mass numbers of people from foreign lands can be permitted to travel halfway around the world, trample our borders, violate our sovereignty, cause unmitigated crime, and deplete our social safety net.\n\n(25:51)We have reasserted that America belongs to the American people, and I encourage all countries to take their own stand in defense of their citizens as well. You have to do that because I see it. I'm not mentioning names. I see it and I can call every single one of them out. You're destroying your countries. They're being destroyed. Europe is in serious trouble. They've been invaded by a force of illegal aliens like nobody's ever seen before. Illegal aliens are pouring into Europe, and nobody's doing anything to change it, to get them out. It's not sustainable. And because they choose to be politically correct, they're doing just absolutely nothing about it.\n\n(26:43)And I have to say, I look at London where you have a terrible mayor, a terrible, terrible mayor and it's been so changed, so changed. Now they want to go to Sharia law, but you're in a different country, you can't do that. Both the immigration and their suicidal energy ideas will be the death of Western Europe if something is not done immediately. This cannot be sustained. What makes the world so beautiful is that each country is unique, but to stay this way, every sovereign nation must have the right to control their own borders. You have the right to control your borders, as we do now, and to limit the sheer numbers of migrants entering their countries and paid for by the people of that nation that were there and that built that particular nation at the time. They put their blood, sweat, tears, money into that country, and now they're being ruined.\n\n(27:44)Proud nations must be allowed to protect their communities and prevent their societies from being overwhelmed by people they have never seen before with different customs, religions, with different everything. Where migrants have violated laws, lodged false asylum claims or claimed refugee status for illegitimate reasons, they should, in many cases, be immediately sent home. And while we will always have a big heart for places and people that are struggling and truly compassionate, answers will be given. We have to solve the problem and we have to solve it in their countries, not create new problems in our countries. And we are very helpful to a lot of countries that are just not able to send their people anymore. They used to send them to us in caravans of 25, 30,000 people each, these massive caravans of people pouring into our country, totally unchecked and unvetted, but not anymore.\n\n(28:46)According to the Council of Europe, in 2024, almost 50% of inmates in German prisons were foreign nationals or migrants. In Austria, the number was 53% of the people in prisons were from places that weren't from where they are now. In Greece, the number was 54%. And in Switzerland, beautiful Switzerland, 72% of the people in prisons are from outside of Switzerland. When your prisons are filled with so-called asylum seekers who repaid kindness, and that's what they did, they repaid kindness with crime, it's time to end the failed experiment of open borders. You have to end it now. I see it, I can tell you.\n\n(29:31)I'm really good at this stuff. Your countries are going to hell. In America, we've taken bold action to swiftly shut down uncontrolled migration. Once we started detaining and deporting everyone who crossed the border and removing illegal aliens from the United States, they simply stopped coming. They're not coming anymore. We're getting a lot of credit, but they're not coming anymore. This was a humanitarian act for all involved because on the trips up,\n\nUS President Donald Trump (30:00):\n\nThousands of people a week were dying. Women were being raped. Nobody's ever seen anything like it. Raped, horribly beaten, raped. On the trip up, the journey up, it was a long, it was a long walk. It was a long, arduous journey indeed, and it was also a historic victory against human trafficking throughout the region. What we did was a victory and we saved so many lives of people that wouldn't make the journey. That journey was loaded up with death. Loaded up with death. Dead bodies all along. All along the roads of jungles to get up. They go through jungles, they go through areas so hot, you couldn't breathe. They were dying of suffocation, areas so hot, that you couldn't breathe. Dead bodies all over. By them not coming, we're saving tremendous numbers of lives. My people have done a fantastic job in doing what they did, and the American public agrees with it.\n\n(31:09)I mean, I was very proud to see this morning. I have the highest poll numbers I've ever had. Part of it is because of what we've done on the border. I guess the other part is what we've done in the economy. Joe Biden's policies empowered murderous gangs, human smugglers, child traffickers, drug cartels, and prisoners. Prisoners from all over the world. The previous administration also lost nearly 300,000 children. Think of that. They lost more than 300,000 children, little children who were trafficked into the United States on the Biden watch, many of whom have been raped, exploited and abused and sold. Sold. Nobody talks about that. The fake news doesn't write about it with many others, young children who are missing or dead. And we found a lot of these children and we're sending it back and we've been sending it back to their parents. They said nobody knows who they are.\n\n(32:09)They said, \"Where do you come from?\" And they'll give us a country and we'll find out and we'll figure it out, or we'll bring them back to their homes. And the mother and father rushed to the door and their tears in their eyes. They can't believe that they're seeing their son or daughter, their little son or daughter again. We've done almost 30,000 of them so far. Any system that results in the mass trafficking of children is inherently evil, yet that is exactly what the globalist migration agenda has done, and it's what it's all about. In America, those days, as you know, are over. The Trump administration is working and we are continuing to work to track down the villains that are causing this problem. And also, as I said, to get back the 30,000 we've already returned.\n\n(32:58)Now, I think we're going to have another.... We're going to find a lot. You're not going to find all of them. More than 300,000. They're lost or they're dead. They're lost, or they're dead because of the animals that did this. To protect our citizens, I've also designated multiple savage drug cartels as forest. And you see this and you see it happening right before your eyes. Let's put it this way. People don't like taking big loads of drugs in boats anymore. There aren't too many boats that are traveling on the seas by Venezuela. They tend not to want to travel very quickly anymore. And we virtually stopped drugs coming into our country by sea. We call them the water drugs. They kill hundreds of thousands of people. I've also designated multiple savage drug cartels as forest... foreign terrorist organizations along with two bloodthirsty transnational gangs, probably the worst gangs anywhere in the world.\n\n(34:02)MS-13 and Tren de Aragua. Tren de Aragua is from Venezuela, by the way. Such organizations torture, maim, mutilate and murder with impunity. They're the enemies of all humanity. For this reason, we've recently begun using the supreme power of the United States military to destroy Venezuelan terrorists and trafficking networks led by Nicolas Maduro to every terrorist thug smuggling poisonous drugs into the United States of America. Please be warned that we will blow you out of existence. That's what we're doing. We have no choice. Can't let it happen. I believe we lost 300,000 people last year to drugs. 300,000. Fentanyl and other drugs. Each boat that we sink carries drugs that would kill more than 25,000 Americans. We will not let that happen. Energy is another area where the United States is now thriving like never before. We're getting rid of the falsely named renewables.\n\n(35:11)By the way, they're a joke. They don't work. They're too expensive. They're not strong enough to fire up the plants that you need to make your country great. The wind doesn't blow. Those big windmills are so pathetic and so bad, so expensive to operate, and they have to be rebuilt all the time and they start to rust and rot. Most expensive energy ever conceived. And it's actually energy. You're supposed to make money with energy, not lose money. You lose money, the governments have to subsidize. You can't put them out without massive subsidies. And most of them are built in China, and I give China a lot of credit. They build them, but they're very few wind farms. So why is it that they build them and they send them all over the world, but they barely use them? You know what? They use coal, they use gas, they use almost anything, but they don't like wind, but they sure as hell like selling the windmills.\n\n(36:10)Europe on the other hand, is a long way to go with many countries being on the brink of destruction because of the green energy agenda. And I give a lot of credit to Germany. Germany was being led down a very sick path both on immigration by the way and on energy. They were going green and they were going bankrupt. And the new leadership, new leadership came in and they went back to where they were with fossil fuel and with nuclear, which is good, it's now safe and you can do it properly. But they went back to where they were and they opened up a lot of different plants, energy plants, energy-producing plants, and they're doing well. I give Germany a lot of credit for that. They've said, this is a disaster. What's happening? They were going all green. All green is all bankrupt. That's what it represents.\n\n(37:06)And it's not politically correct. I'll be very badly criticized for saying it, but I'm here to tell the truth. I don't care. It doesn't matter to me. I'm in New York City, I'm feeling a lot safer. Crime, we're getting crime down. And by the way, speaking of crime, Washington D.C., Washington D.C. was the crime capital of America. Now, it's a totally... After 12 days, it's a totally safe city. Everyone's going out to dinner, they're going out to restaurants. Your wife can walk down the middle of the street with or without you. Nothing's going to happen. My people have done a fantastic job. And yes, I called in the National Guard and the National Guard took care of business. And they weren't politically correct, but they took care of business. We got 1,700 career criminals out, brought them back to where they came from, the countries where they came from or put them in jails. Washington D.C. is now a totally safe city again and I welcome you to come. In fact, we'll have dinner together at a local restaurant and we'll be able to walk. We don't have to go by an armor-plated vehicle. We'll walk right over there from the White House. They've given up their powerful edge. A lot of the countries that we're talking about and oil and gas, such as essentially closing the Great North Sea oil. Oh, the North Sea. I know it so well. Aberdeen was the oil capital of Europe and this tremendous oil that hasn't been found in the North Sea. Tremendous oil. And I was with the Prime Minister I respected, like a lot. And I said, \"You're sitting with the greatest asset.\" They essentially closed it by making it so highly taxed that no developer, no oil company can go there. They have tremendous oil left and more importantly, they have tremendous oil that hasn't even been found yet.\n\n(38:59)And what a tremendous asset for the United Kingdom. And I hope the prime minister's listening because I told it to him three days in a row. That's all he heard. North Sea oil, North Sea, because I want to see them do well. I want to stop seeing them ruining that beautiful Scottish and English countryside with windmills and massive solar panels that go seven miles by seven miles taken away farmland, but we're not letting this happen in America. In 1982, the executive director of the United Nations Environmental Program predicted that by the year 2000, climate change would cause a global catastrophe. He said that it will be irreversible as any nuclear holocaust would be. This is what they said at the United Nations. What happened? Here we are. Another UN official stated in 1989 that within a decade, entire nations could be wiped off the map by global warming. Not happening.\n\n(40:04)It used to be global cooling. If you look back years ago in the 1920s and the 1930s, they said, global cooling will kill the world. We have to do something. Then they said global warming will kill the world. But then it started getting cooler. So now they could just call it climate change because that way they can't miss climate change because if it goes higher or lower, whatever the hell happens, it's climate change. It's the greatest con job ever perpetrated on the world, in my opinion. Climate change, no matter what happens, you're involved in that. No more global warming, no more global cooling. All of these predictions made by the United Nations and many others, often for bad reasons were wrong. They were made by stupid people that of course their country's fortunes and given those same countries, no chance for success. If you don't get away from this green scam, your country is going to fail.\n\n(41:06)And I'm really good at predicting things. They actually said during the campaign, they had a hat, the best-selling hat. Trump was right about everything. And I don't say that in a braggadocious way, but it's true. I've been right about everything. And I'm telling you that if you don't get away from the green energy scam, your country is going to fail. And if you don't stop people that you've never seen before, that you have nothing in common with, your country is going to fail. I'm the President of the United States, but I worry about Europe. I love Europe. I love the people of Europe, and I hate to see it being devastated by energy and immigration. This double-tailed monster destroys everything in its wake, and they cannot let that happen any longer. You're doing it because you want to be nice, you want to be politically correct and you're destroying your heritage.\n\n(42:04)They must take control strongly and immediately of the unmitigated immigration disaster and the fake energy catastrophe before it's too late. The carbon footprint is a hoax made up by people with evil intentions and they're heading down a path of total destruction. The carbon footprint, it was a big, big thing. A few years ago, I remember hearing about the carbon footprint and then President Obama would get into Air Force One, a massive Boeing 747 and not a new one, an old one with old engines that spew everything into the atmosphere. He talked about the carbon footprint, we must do... Then he'd get in and he'd fly from Washington to Hawaii to play a round of golf, and then he'd get back onto that big beautiful plane and he'd fly back and he'd talk about, again, global warming and the carbon footprint. It's a con job at extreme cost and expense.\n\n(43:09)Europe reduced its own carbon footprint by 37%. Think of that. Congratulations Europe. Great job. You cost yourself a lot of jobs, a lot of factories closed, but you reduced the carbon footprint by 37%. However, for all of that sacrifice and much more, it's been totally wiped out and then some by a global increase of 54%, much of it coming from China and other countries that are thriving around China, which now produces more CO2 than all the other developed nations in the world. So all of these countries are working so hard on the carbon footprint, which is nonsense by the way. It's nonsense. It's interesting. In the United States, we have still radicalized environmentalists and they want the factories to stop. Everything should stop. No more cows. We don't want cows anymore. I guess they want to kill all the cows. They want to do things that are just unbelievable and you have it too.\n\n(44:16)But we have a border, strong, and we have a shape, and that shape doesn't just go straight up. That shape is amorphous when it comes to the atmosphere. And if we had the most clean air, and I think we do, we have very clean air, we have the cleanest air we've had in many, many years. But the problem is that other countries like China, which has air that's a little bit rough, it blows. And no matter what you're doing down here, the air up here tends to get very dirty because it comes in from other countries where their air isn't so clean and the environmentalists refuse to acknowledge that. Same thing with garbage. In\n\nUS President Donald Trump (45:00):\n\nIn Asia, they dump much of their garbage right into the ocean. And over about a one-week and two-week journey, it flows right past Los Angeles. You've seen it, massive amounts of garbage. Almost too much to do anything about, flowing past Los Angeles, past San Francisco, and then somebody would get in trouble because he dropped a cigarette on the beach. The whole thing is crazy. The primary effect of these brutal green energy policies has not been to help the environment, but to redistribute manufacturing and industrial activity from developed countries that follow the insane rules that are put down, to polluting countries that break the rules and are making a fortune. They're making a fortune.\n\n(45:52)European electricity bills are now four to five times more expensive than those in China, and two to three times higher than the United States, and our bills are coming way down. You probably see that. Our gasoline prices are way down.You know, we have an expression: “Drill, baby drill.” And that’s what we’re doing. We’re going to be much lower in a year from now. But they’ve come way down over the last year. As a result, every air conditioner is like very uncommon to see one in some of these countries because the electric cost is so high. So while the U.S. has approximately 1,300 heat-related deaths annually, that’s a lot, Europe loses more than 175,000 people to heat deaths each year because the cost is so expensive they can’t turn on an air conditioner.What is that all about? That’s not Europe. That’s not the Europe that I love and know. All in the name of pretending to stop the global warming hoax. The entire globalist concept of asking successful, industrialized nations to inflict pain on themselves and radically disrupt their entire societies must be rejected immediately, and it must be immediate. That’s why in America, I withdrew from the fake Paris Climate Accord, where, by the way, America was paying so much more than every country. Others weren’t paying. China didn’t have to pay until 2030. Russia was given an old standard that was easy to meet, a 1990 standard. But for the United States, we’re supposed to pay like a trillion dollars. And I said, “This is another scam.” The fact is United States has been taken advantage of by the world for many, many years, but not any longer, as you probably noticed.\n\n(47:46)I unleashed massive energy production and signed historic executive orders to hunt for oil. But we don't have to do much hunting because we have the most oil of any nation, anywhere, oil and gas in the world. And if you add coal, we have the most of any nation in the world. Clean. I call it clean, beautiful coal. You can do things today with coal that you couldn't have done 10 years ago, 15 years. So I have a little standing order in the White House. Never use the word coal, only use the words clean, beautiful coal. Sounds much better, doesn't it? But we stand ready to provide any country with abundant, affordable energy supplies if you need them, when most of you do.\n\n(48:29)We're proudly exporting energy all over the world. We're now the largest exporter. In the United States, we want trade and robust commerce with all nations. Everybody. We want to help nations. We're going to help nations, but it must also be fair and reciprocal. The challenge with trade is much the same with climate. The countries that followed the rules, all their factories have been plundered. It's really sad to watch. They've been broken. They've been broken by countries that broke the rules.\n\n(49:05)That's why the United States is now applying tariffs to other countries. And much as these tariffs were, for many years, applied to us, uncontrollably applied to us, we've used tariffs as a defense mechanism under the Trump administration, including my first term, where hundreds of billions of dollars in tariffs were taken in. And by the way, we had the lowest inflation and now we have very low inflation. The only thing different is that we have hundreds of billions of dollars flowing into our country. But this is how we will ensure that the system works for everyone and is sustainable into the future. We're also using tariffs to defend our sovereignty and security throughout the world, including against nations that have taken advantage of former U.S. administrations for decades, including the most corrupt, incompetent administration in history. The sleepy Joe Biden administration.\n\n(50:07)Brazil now faces major tariffs in response to its unprecedented efforts to interfere in the rights and freedoms of our American citizens and others with censorship, repression, weaponization, judicial corruption, and targeting of political critics in the United States. I have a little problem saying this because I must tell you, I was walking in and the leader of Brazil was walking out. We saw him and I saw him, he saw me and we embraced, and then I'm saying, can you believe I'm going to be saying this in just two minutes? But we actually agreed that we would meet next week. We didn't have much time to talk, like about 20 seconds. They were, in retrospect, I'm glad I waited because this thing didn't work out too well. But we did talk. We had a good talk and we agreed to meet next week, if that's of interest. But he seemed like a very nice man, actually. He liked me, I liked him. And I only do business with people I like.\n\n(51:13)I don't, when I don't like them, I don't like them. But we had, at least for about 39 seconds, we had excellent chemistry. It's a good sign. But also in the past, Brazil, can you believe this? Unfairly tariffed our nation. But now because of our tariffs, we are hitting them back and we're hitting them back very hard. As President, I will always defend our national sovereignty and the rights of American citizens. So I'm very sorry to say this, that Brazil is doing poorly and will continue to do poorly. They can only do well when they're working with us. Without us, they will fail just as others have failed. It's true.\n\n(52:01)Next year the United States will celebrate the 250th anniversary of our glorious independence, a testament to enduring power and American freedom and spirit. We will also be proudly hosting the 2026 FIFA World Cup, and shortly thereafter, the 2028 Olympics, which is going to be very exciting. I hope you all come. I hope that countless people from all over the globe will take part of these great, these will be great celebrations of liberty and human achievement, and that together, we all can rejoice in the miracles of history that began in July 4th, 1776 when we founded the Light to All Nations. And it's something really that an amazing thing came out of that date. It's called the United States of America. In honor of this momentous anniversary, I hope that all countries who find inspiration in our example will join us in renewing our commitment values, and those values, really, that we hold so dear together.\n\n(53:04)Let us defend free speech and free expression. Let us protect religious liberty, including for the most persecuted religion on the planet today. It's called Christianity. And let us safeguard our sovereignty and cherish qualities that have made each of our nations so special, incredible, and extraordinary.\n\n(53:24)In closing, just want to repeat that immigration and the high cost of so-called green renewable energy is destroying a large part of the free world and a large part of our planet. Countries that cherish freedom are fading fast because of their policies on these two subjects. You need strong borders and traditional energy sources if you are going to be great again. Whether you have come from north or south, east or west, near or far, every leader in this beautiful hall today represents a rich culture, a noble history, and a proud heritage that makes each nation majestic and unique, unlike anything else in human history or any other place on the face of the earth.\n\n(54:13)From London to Lima, from Rome to Athens, from Paris to Seoul, from Cairo to Tokyo, and Amsterdam to right here in New York City, we stand on the shoulders of the leaders and legends, generals and giants, heroes and titans who won and built our beloved nations, all of our nations, with their own courage, strength, spirit, and skill. Our ancestors climbed to mountains, conquered oceans, crossed deserts, and trekked over wide open plains. They charged into thunderous battles, plunged into grave dangers, and they were soldiers, and farmers, and workers, and warriors, and explorers, and patriots. They built towns into cities, tribes into kingdoms, ideas into industries, and small islands into mighty empires. You're a part of all of that. They were champions for their people who never gave up and who never ever gave in. Their values, defined our national identities. Their visions forged our magnificent destiny. Everybody in this room is a part of it in your own way.\n\n(55:27)Each of us inherits the deeds and the myths, the triumphs, the legacies of our own heroes and founders who so bravely showed us the way. Our ancestors gave everything for homelands, that they defended with pride, with sweat, with blood, with life, and with death. Now, the righteous task of protecting the nations that they built belongs to each and every one of us. So together, let us uphold our sacred duty to our people and to our citizens. Let us protect their borders, ensure their safety, preserve their cultures, treasures, and traditions, and fight, fight, fight for their precious dreams and their cherished freedoms, and in friendship and really, a beautiful vision.\n\n(56:18)Let us all work together to build a bright, beautiful planet, a planet that we all share, a planet of peace and a world that is richer, better, and more beautiful than ever before. That can happen. It will happen. It will happen, and I hope it can happen and start right now, right at this moment. We'll turn it around. We're going to make our countries better, safer, more beautiful. We're going to take care of our people. Thank you very much. It's been an honor. God bless the nations of the world. Thank you very much. Bye.\n\n(56:56)Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 1 (57:06):\n\nOn behalf of the Assembly, I wish to thank the President of the United States.\n\n‍",

    "transcript": "Donald Trump (00:00):\n\nReady? Well, thank you very much. As you know, we passed the continuing resolution in the Republican House today. It was an amazing vote, actually. It showed we want to keep things going and going properly. It was good for a lot of reasons. The Republicans want to keep government open. But in the Senate, we have 53 Republicans total, and we need 60 votes. That means we need Democrat votes.\n\n(00:31)I want to thank Senator John Fetterman, who wants to keep the country open. We're doing so well, as a country. We're doing probably better than ever before, if you look at the stock market and other indicators, we have tremendous investment coming in records, investment coming. Everything is going well, but the Democrats are unhappy about that because they don't want it to go well. I think they actually dislike our country greatly, so they want to shut down the country.\n\n(00:58)They want to have open borders. They want to stop the fighting of crime, where we've been very successful. The D.C., as you know, Washington, D.C., it's a hot place right now. Everyone is having dinners. They're going out all over. There's very little crime. They haven't seen numbers like this in many, many years, and other places. As you know, we're going into Memphis. We'll soon be going into Chicago. We've already had people out there and in there, and FBI has been there, and we've brought the numbers down, but we got to be bringing them down a whole lot.\n\n(01:34)But I guess they want crime, and we fight crime, and it's a pretty big difference. They want to have men play in women's sports. They want to transgender for everybody. And if they don't get everything that they want, all these things that they want, that are proven so badly. They want to close our government down. We're not going to let bad things happen to our country, and we're not going to approve things that we shouldn't be approving. Just today, the House Democrats voted against condemning the political assassination of Charlie Kirk. Who can vote against that, the condemning all they're saying, \"Please, condemn the assassination of a human being,\" and they said, \"No, that we're going to do that.\"\n\n(02:16)Remember this. We had an election a very short time ago. Republicans won presidential. We won the popular vote by a lot. We won all seven swing states. We won the electoral college by a lot. We won most US counties in a total landslide. So, we won most. It's a very big statistic. We won the counties in a number that I don't believe has been hit before, 2,600 counties versus 525 counties for the Democrats. So, the Democrats really should start respecting what takes place at the voter booth. In many cases, it's not a voter booth because they have mail-in voting, which is a very corrupt situation, but despite that, we won in a landslide. And we have to remember, when you win the election, elections have consequences.\n\n(03:17)So, we'll continue to talk to the Democrats, but I think you could very well end up with a closed country for a period of time. And we'll take care of the military. We'll take care of social security. We'll take care of the things that we have to take care of. A lot of the things the Democrats fight for, which in many cases aren't very good things, will not be able to be paid. So, we'll watch and see how they do with that, to handle their constituents pretty carefully. So, we're proud to announce that we won the House. We did fine in the Senate, but we need 60 votes. So, we have 53 senators, and we need 60 votes. That means the Democrats have to vote in the Senate, and I don't think they will be voting.\n\n(04:02)Now, what we are doing, we're really here today to talk about something else, which is the Gold Card, which is going to bring a lot of money into our country, which is going to reduce taxes and lots of other good things, but we'll save that for a little bit later. Why don't we do this first, and then we'll talk about the Gold Card? Okay? Any questions [inaudible 00:04:20]?\n\nSpeaker X (04:16):\n\n[inaudible 00:04:21].\n\n(04:16)[inaudible 00:04:22] on TikTok?\n\n(04:16)[inaudible 00:04:23].\n\nSpeaker 1 (04:16):\n\nYour call to President Xi… Mr. President, Mr. President, your call this morning with President Xi?\n\nDonald Trump (04:27):\n\nIt was great. I had a great call with President Xi. And as you know, he approved the TikTok deal, and we're in the process. We have some great investors. They're some of the biggest in the world, American investors, great people, and we look forward to getting that deal closed.\n\nSpeaker 1 (04:39):\n\nIs it fully approved? The Chinese statement has been, necessarily, [inaudible 00:04:40] take it back?\n\nDonald Trump (04:40):\n\nWell, I think so. I mean, when you say fully approved, I don't know what that means. We have to get it signed. I guess that could be a formality. I've found his word to be very good. President Xi and I had a long talk. We talked for almost two hours then. It started at 8:00 in the morning, and I think it was a very good talk. We talked about trade. We talked about war. We talked about a lot of things. We talked about Russian-Ukraine, obviously, and Gaza. We talked about a lot of subjects. It was a long call. It was a good call. We have a very good relationship. But the TikTok deal is well on its way, as you know, and the investors are getting ready.\n\n(05:32)And I think China wanted to see it stay open, too. They wanted to see it, and I can tell you, the young people in our country wanted to see it stay open very badly because… And if you take a look at my numbers, no Republican has ever done anything like we did. We got massive numbers of youth vote and, by the way, helped very much by Charlie Kirk. So, Charlie was very much in favor of TikTok. He liked TikTok, and he said, \"You should use it.\" And other people said that, too, and I used it. I don't know if I had the all… I think I set records. I looked at numbers that are phenomenal. We'll pass the amount to you. And it had probably a pretty big effect on the election because we won the election by a lot.\n\n(06:15)So, we are in a situation where, in a little while, meaning a number of days, we'll probably… I don't know if you can make a deal with these people. I think these people are crazy. Again, anybody who wants open borders and don't want to fight… They don't want to fight crime. They hate to fight crime. And in Chicago, last weekend, you had 11 people killed, murdered, and you had 28 shot. And those numbers have been pretty consistent all throughout a period of time, whether it was four people, five people, six people, 11 people, 12 people, killed, murdered, and they don't want to spend money to fight crime. And it's not even much money. Relatively speaking, it's very little, but we're going there anyway. It doesn't make any difference. We're going to Chicago. We're going to Memphis next. And we're going to clean up the crime in the cities because we have to do that. Okay?\n\nSpeaker X (07:01):\n\nMr. [inaudible 00:07:01]-\n\n(07:01)[inaudible 00:07:01]-\n\n(07:01)[inaudible 00:07:01]-\n\nSpeaker 2 (07:01):\n\nOn TikTok, Mr. President, with this deal today, are you confident that the CCP won't be exerting control over TikTok?\n\nDonald Trump (07:16):\n\nYeah, we're going to have a very tight control. And look, it's an amazing thing that has been created. There's tremendous value with TikTok. And I'm a little prejudice because I, frankly, did so well on it. It got me numbers that nobody has ever even heard of before. So, a lot of people want it. The young people of this country want it badly. The parents of those young people want it badly. So, we were able to work out a deal with China, and it's a very good deal for us. I hope it's a good deal for them.\n\nSpeaker 2 (07:48):\n\nWould-\n\nSpeaker X (07:48):\n\nMr. President…\n\n(07:48)[inaudible 00:07:50].\n\nSpeaker 2 (07:51):\n\n[inaudible 00:07:50] confident in a… or would you accept a deal where China controls the algorithm of TikTok?\n\nDonald Trump (07:54):\n\nWell, it's all being worked out. We're going to have very good control. These are American investors, all of them, and they all love our country. They're all very well known people, very famous people actually, financially, and they'll have control of it.\n\nSpeaker X (08:14):\n\nMr. President, [inaudible 00:08:15]-\n\n(08:14)[inaudible 00:08:15].\n\nDonald Trump (08:15):\n\nI want to say, I want to thank President Xi because he was a gentleman, and we've just had a good relationship. And a lot of people in this country want it to be open.\n\nSpeaker X (08:24):\n\nIs there [inaudible 00:08:25]-\n\n(08:24)Mr. President…\n\n(08:24)[inaudible 00:08:25]-\n\nDonald Trump (08:27):\n\nIf it weren't open, maybe. I don't know. I think we won by so much, it wouldn't have mattered, but we got a lot of Republican votes from very young people. You go ahead, Jeff.\n\nJeff (08:42):\n\nThank you, sir. Russian jets entered Estonia's air space today for 12 minutes. Do you see that as a threat to NATO?\n\nDonald Trump (08:45):\n\nWell, I'm going to have to look it. They're going to be briefing me in a short while, so I'll let you know about it tonight or tomorrow.\n\nJeff (08:45):\n\nWhat's your take, in general, just [inaudible 00:08:53]?\n\nDonald Trump (08:45):\n\nWell, I don't love it. I don't love it when that happens. This could be big trouble, but I'll let you know later. They're going to brief me in about an hour.\n\nJeff (09:00):\n\nAnd to follow up with Charlie Kirk, there has been a lot of talk about free speech this week. Do you see a difference between cancel culture and consequence culture?\n\nDonald Trump (09:13):\n\nWell, I mean, your question is a little trick question.\n\nJeff (09:13):\n\nIt's not [inaudible 00:09:14].\n\nDonald Trump (09:13):\n\nI'm a very strong person for free speech. At the same time, when you have networks that where I won an election, like in counties, I guess it's 2,600 to 525. That's called a landslide times two when you have that level of popularity, of voter support, as I did in the last election, and yet 97 and 94%, different numbers, you see different numbers with different stats, but 97, 94, 95, 96% of the people are against me in the sense of the newscasts are against me. The stories are, they said, 97% bad. So, they give 97…\n\n(09:59)They'll take a great story, and they'll make it bad. See, I think that's really illegal, personally. You can't have a free airwave, if you're getting free airwaves from the United States government, and you can't have that and say… And somebody that just won an election. And I had to go through this during the election. I think it's a miracle that I can win when 97% of the stories on the networks are bad, or whatever it may be. Whether it's 89, it doesn't matter. It's a tremendous number. You know it. You report it all the time, and it changes.\n\n(10:40)But when you have that kind of a negative reporting, fake negative reporting, when they take a great story and they make it into a bad story constantly… That's what they do. Look, 60 Minutes took Kamala's answer, and they threw it out and they gave her a different answer so that she sounded competent. When things like that happen, George Slopadopoulos, from your network, George Slopadopoulos had to pay $16 million to me because of what he said, and that's ABC. You had to pay more than that. Your network had to pay more than that. So, I think it's very sad, but I think that reporting has to be at least accurate, at least accurate to an extent.\n\n(11:23)Again, when somebody is given 97% of the stories are bad about a person, that's no longer free speech. That's no longer, that's just cheating, and they cheat. And they become really members of the Democrat National Committee. That's what they are, the networks, in my opinion. They're just offshoots of the Democrat National Committee.\n\nSpeaker X (11:48):\n\nMr. President, [inaudible 00:11:50]-\n\n(11:48)[inaudible 00:11:50].\n\n(11:48)Mr. President, Mr. Prsident, [inaudible 00:11:51]-\n\nDonald Trump (11:48):\n\nGo ahead.\n\nSpeaker 3 (11:54):\n\nThank you. [inaudible 00:11:52] zero hedge. People are still anticipating who your pick for National Security Advisor will be. They're worried Marco Rubio is a little overworked, and one of the reported front-runners is Michael Anton from the State Department.\n\nDonald Trump (12:06):\n\nHe's good.\n\nSpeaker 3 (12:06):\n\nHe has just authored the National Security Strategy. Also, in the mix is Mike Flynn-\n\nDonald Trump (12:06):\n\nGood.\n\nSpeaker 3 (12:11):\n\n… and Steve Witkoff. Can you give us an indication for who-\n\nDonald Trump (12:15):\n\nWell, they're all good. Well, we'll make a decision soon.\n\nSpeaker 3 (12:15):\n\nOkay.\n\nDonald Trump (12:15):\n\nBut we're doing very well. I settled seven wars. More than that, I think, but actually we settled seven wars. We're working on Gaza. It's a tough one, but we'll get it done somehow. And we're also working with Russia and Ukraine, and they hate each other so much, you wouldn't believe it.\n\nSpeaker 3 (12:32):\n\nAnd are you considering-\n\nDonald Trump (12:32):\n\nPresident Putin and President Zelenskyy, they hate each other to a level that you wouldn't believe, so they're having a little bit of a problem with that.\n\nSpeaker 3 (12:40):\n\nAnd are you considering Stephen Miran for Fed chair?\n\nDonald Trump (12:45):\n\nI hadn't thought of it too much. He's doing a great job, just got approved. His vote is a very good one. The Fed should have done more. Too Late Powell is terrible. He's a terrible chair. I think it's terrible. But despite that, we're powering through it. We have another record stock market today. We're at very, very high levels, and we're at the highest levels, so we're setting records many, many days. During my administration, we've set records, and we'll see what happens with 50,000. 50,000 is a pretty big number. Never come close, and we're not so far away from it.\n\n(13:11)It's because they see what's happening. Not so much what's happening exactly right now, but they see all the plants that are being built. They see the kind of investment that's going to be made. When you take $17 trillion… So, Biden had 250 billion, or putting a simpler way, they had much less than a trillion, but they had less than a trillion for four years. I have 17 trillion for eight months. Nobody has ever seen anything like it, and I think they're looking at that and they're saying, when those plants open… Right now they're being built, a lot of them, and some are starting over the next year. It takes a while, but we're getting fast permits. And when those plants get built, I don't think there'll be anything like what we're going to experience. Yeah?\n\nSpeaker X (14:11):\n\nMr. President…\n\n(14:11)[inaudible 00:14:13]-\n\nSpeaker 4 (14:14):\n\nMr. President, if I can, on the top subject of free speech, Ted Cruz compared Brendan Carr to a mob boss, the way he's threatening television stations, and saying it's absolutely dangerous for the government to determine which speech is okay and which is not. What's your reaction to Ted Cruz?\n\nDonald Trump (14:27):\n\nI think Brendan Carr is an incredible American patriot with courage. It used to be… I remember in the old days, networks would have to get licensed, relicensed, and it was always a big deal. They had to show honesty and integrity. When you have a network… Again, I'll use the same numbers, whether it's 90 or 94 or 97, all different numbers, but when you have networks that give somebody 97% bad publicity or 94% bad publicity,\n\nDonald Trump (15:01):\n\nI think that's dishonesty. And you know they're getting free airwaves, right? You know that, right? You get them for nothing. These airwaves, they make millions and millions of dollars. The news makes millions of dollars. ABC, your network, your network wrote very badly about me and they had to pay me $16 million. I wasn't looking for that.\n\nJohn (15:18):\n\nBut you think you have a right or that Brendan Carr has a right to take away the license?\n\nDonald Trump (15:24):\n\nNo, I think Brendan Carr is patriot. I think Brendan Carr is a courageous person. I think Brendan Carr just would like to see the airwaves be used illegally and incorrectly and purposely horribly. Doesn't like to see a person that won the election in a landslide get 97% bad publicity before the election. It's amazing that I won the election with that.\n\n(15:48)But here's what happened. The people have given you networks no credibility. They don't give them any credibility, John. If they did, they wouldn't vote for me. They wouldn't have voted for me.\n\n(15:58)When you look at, I mean, you could also say the liberal media, the liberal left, when you look at these stories and papers, but we're not talking about that. We're talking about, I assume you're talking mostly about the networks, but they have a licensing procedure and you can read it as well. They have to show honesty and integrity. And when they take the goods-\n\nJohn (16:19):\n\nWho decides that?\n\nDonald Trump (16:22):\n\nWell, I think the people decide. That's why I'm president. When they take a-\n\nJohn (16:25):\n\nSo that means you decide whether-\n\nDonald Trump (16:26):\n\n… great success, like you often do, and you make it into like it's a loser or you put a negative spin on it, I don't think that's right. So I think Brendan Carr is a great American patriot, so I disagree with Ted Cruz on that.\n\nSpeaker 5 (16:39):\n\n[inaudible 00:16:40] UN next week. You're going to the UN-\n\nDonald Trump (16:44):\n\nI'll be at the UN. I'll be making a speech, yes.\n\nSpeaker 5 (16:44):\n\nAnd are you meeting any other world leaders-\n\nDonald Trump (16:44):\n\nMany of them.\n\nSpeaker 5 (16:44):\n\nCan you tell us who?\n\nSpeaker 6 (16:44):\n\nWho are you meeting, Mr. President?\n\nDonald Trump (16:52):\n\nWell, I'm just meeting with them. They're being set up.\n\nSpeaker 6 (16:52):\n\nSyria, Zelensky?\n\nSpeaker 5 (16:52):\n\nWhat is your goal for attending that meeting? What do you hope to get out of it?\n\nDonald Trump (16:59):\n\nWorld peace. Nobody's done a better job than I've done in world peace. Nobody's settled so many wars as I have. I've been here probably a little bit more than eight months and I've settled seven. And that doesn't include the destruction of a vast potential nuclear disaster in Iran, which we wiped out totally. As I say, obliterated. We obliterated it. It's been turned right with this beautiful plane right here. We just ordered some more of them, by the way. The B-2 bomber, just ordered some more of the more updated version, not that we needed that. We just need the plane because it was so flawless.\n\n(17:43)These pilots flew 37 hours flawlessly. Not an engine problem, not a screw, not a bolt came loose. It was an amazing… Compare that to many years ago, Jimmy Carter, same country with the helicopters and problems and the prisoners and the hostages and what a mess. These planes flew 37 hours without a stop. They fueled up. We had 52 tankers fueling the planes along the way. It was an incredible… And every single bomb hit its mark.\n\n(18:17)And then we fired 30 of them from submarines, from a submarine. What a job that was. And I don't even include that, but that stopped a war. That stopped, maybe a catastrophic war.\n\nSpeaker 6 (18:31):\n\nMr. President-\n\nDonald Trump (18:31):\n\nSo I think that nobody's ever done anywhere near that.\n\n(18:36)Now, on top of that, we're working very hard to get Russia, Ukraine settled. We'll see what's going to happen there. I hope we're going to get it done. President Xi and I spoke about it and I believe that he really would like to see it done also, and I think he's going to work with us to help.\n\nSpeaker 5 (18:50):\n\nWhat was your message to-\n\nSpeaker 6 (18:50):\n\nMr. President, on the UN-\n\nSpeaker 5 (18:50):\n\nWhat was your message to President Xi on the war in Ukraine? What are you asking him?\n\nDonald Trump (19:01):\n\nWell, it's the same as his message to me. He would like to see it done. He would like to see it. I believe he would like to see it ended. Yes, I do believe.\n\nSpeaker 6 (19:06):\n\nMr. President, these two wars that we were talking about, Gaza and Ukraine, are escalating at the same time you're going to take the stage at the UN, back at the stage after these years. Do you plan to setting any kind of red lines for these two countries? And you said before you're frustrated with Putin. Are you also frustrated with Netanyahu?\n\nDonald Trump (19:28):\n\nWe have a long time ago before I get up and speak at the UN, because every day is a long time when it comes to Gaza and it comes to Israel and the Middle East. So we have a long time to go. But you know a lot of my opinions, and remember this, you can't forget October 7th, either. People are forgetting October 7th. They forget it too quickly. That was one of the worst days in world history. It was the most evil attack that I think you could really say. Babies were involved. Little babies were involved and having their heads chopped off and all of the things that took place. You can't forget that. I don't forget that. A lot of people do, but I don't.\n\n(20:03)Yeah, please.\n\nSpeaker 6 (20:06):\n\nBut how about when… Just one more, Mr. President-\n\nSpeaker 7 (20:07):\n\nOn Bagram, Mr. President, what goes into retaking Bagram? Does that require boots on the ground?\n\nDonald Trump (20:10):\n\nWe'll see what happens with Bagram. We're talking to Afghanistan. It should have never been given up. It was the most embarrassing day in the history of our country. There was no reason to give it up. I was leaving Afghanistan. I was leaving. I was the one that got it down to 5,000 soldiers. But we were going to keep Bagram, the air base. I said it yesterday. And we had an incredible trip, as you know, to UK, and I said it during the press conference.\n\n(20:35)It's one of the most powerful runways ever built in terms of weight, length and load, what it could take. And we just gave it up for nothing. We gave it up for nothing. There was no reason to give it up. We weren't going to leave Bagram. Joe Biden didn't know what he was doing. We had a man that didn't know what he was doing. We had a man, by the way, that didn't approve, if you take a look at what's happening in Congress, we had a man that signed everything with… Almost everything with a auto panel. And he didn't tell the people from the auto pen, whoever was using it, the one man that used it predominantly said that Biden only spoke to him twice and it was only about the weather. Cares about nothing.\n\n(21:21)So those pardons that he gave are illegal. He gave illegal pardons. And that includes the congressman that destroyed and deleted all the information from J6. They deleted everything because it turned out that they were wrong. It turned out that I offered 10,000 National Guard or soldiers, whatever they wanted, and you wouldn't have had a problem. And they turned it down. Nancy Pelosi turned it down and the mayor of Washington, DC turned it down.\n\n(21:50)They deleted everything and they destroyed it, illegally destroyed it. And Biden gave them a pardon. And Biden gave a lot of other people pardons that, frankly, would be in jail if it was for those pardons. But those pardons now are illegal, according to just about everybody.\n\nSpeaker 8 (22:05):\n\nOn Letitia James, are you disappointed that the US attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia has not prosecuted Letitia James? Do you intend to fire him?\n\nDonald Trump (22:15):\n\nWell, we're going to see what happens. I'm not following it very closely. It looks to me like she's very guilty of something, but I really don't know. I know that the US attorney from the Eastern district or from that district in Virginia, that he was approved by two Democrat senators who, in my opinion, are among the worst. And when I learned that two senators, Democrats, because as you know, it's very hard with a blue slip, it's very hard for a Republican to get somebody approved if you have one senator that's a Democrat because of an old custom. It's not a law. It's a custom. It's a ridiculous custom. But if you have a Democrat senator, you have to get that senator approval. In this case, we had two.\n\n(22:57)When I saw that he got two senators, two gentlemen that are bad news, as far as I'm concerned. When I saw that he got approved by those two men, I said, \"Pull him,\" because he can't be any good.\n\nSpeaker 8 (23:12):\n\nSo you want him fired? You want him out?\n\nDonald Trump (23:16):\n\nYeah, I want him out. Yeah. When I learned that he was blue-slipped through by two Democrat senators in Virginia, people that would never vote for… The people that haven't voted for us for probably years, okay, probably years, in my opinion, two bad guys. You know who they are, Warner and Kane. Two bad guys, bad senators, too. They do a terrible job for the people of Virginia.\n\n(23:42)But when I saw that he got approved by these two terrible people that haven't voted, they just don't vote no matter what it is. We could give them the greatest deal ever and they still wouldn't vote. And they voted for this guy. And I have other people, judges and I have US attorneys from other states who have the same situation and they can't get approved. So when I learned that they voted for him, I said, \"I don't really want him.\"\n\n(24:04)Okay. [inaudible 00:24:13], please.\n\nSpeaker 9 (24:12):\n\nHave you seen the polling, the Gallup poll out of Ukraine that shows 23%, less than a quarter of Ukrainians actually support continuing the war against Putin? We saw the European leaders come here and try to say the world is united for the war effort, but Ukrainians have war fatigue themselves.\n\nDonald Trump (24:28):\n\nWell, I don't blame them.\n\nSpeaker 9 (24:31):\n\nHave you seen the polling, and your thoughts on it?\n\nDonald Trump (24:32):\n\nI don't blame them. It's a war that never should have started. It's a war that never would've happened. If I were president, that war never would've happened, ever. That's a disgrace that that war happened. And they're losing anywhere from five to 8,000 people a week on that war, which is the worst since the Second World War. That's a war that should have never happened.\n\nSpeaker 9 (24:48):\n\nAnd if you consider-\n\nDonald Trump (24:49):\n\nWould've never happened. And it didn't happen for four years. When I was here, it didn't happen.\n\n(24:54)Go ahead.\n\nSpeaker 9 (24:55):\n\nHave you considered cutting funding, even promises made by the Biden administration?\n\nDonald Trump (24:58):\n\nWell, we're not spending any money on the war. We're being paid for everything we said. Unlike Biden, he gave them $350 billion. And it was shocking. We're not spending any money on the war. The war is being funded by NATO. NATO is buying our equipment. In fact, I don't want to make money on the war. I don't want to. But we are actually making money on that war because they're buying our equipment, as you know.\n\n(25:22)But NATO, as you know, very important, is funding the entire thing. They're paying for the missiles, for the tanks. They're paying for anything that's sent over there, it goes to NATO, and then NATO does what they want with it. In this case, I guess they give it to Ukraine. It's a very sad war. It's a war that never should have happened.\n\nSpeaker 10 (25:50):\n\n[inaudible 00:25:50] TikTok, could you tell me, is the US government going to take a board seat in the company, and will the US government-\n\nDonald Trump (25:54):\n\nA what?\n\nSpeaker 10 (25:55):\n\nA board seat within the company?\n\nDonald Trump (26:00):\n\nWell, we're going to announce it. Are you talking about TikTok?\n\nSpeaker 10 (26:02):\n\nYes, TikTok.\n\nDonald Trump (26:02):\n\nWe're going to announce it. But it's a great deal for our country. It's a great deal for all of the young people in the country that wanted it and people generally. I was happy with it. Look, I wasn't a fan of TikTok and then I got to use it and I became a fan and it helped me win the election in a landslide. So I think that it's a deal that's going to be great. And it's also controlled by very powerful and very substantial American people. By the way, all American people.\n\n(26:29)Yeah, please. Go ahead, please.\n\nSpeaker 11 (26:33):\n\nMr. President, question from Newsmax. Last year, before you took office, there was an estimated 6.8 million men not actively seeking work of prime working age. So if you and Secretary Lutnick could talk about the efforts your administration is taking to help our American gentlemen get back to work.\n\nDonald Trump (26:50):\n\nYeah, well, what we're doing is we're building plants over the United States and frankly, because of tariffs, we're taking in trillions of dollars, trillions of dollars. And countries that have ripped us off for years, and everyone knows this, countries that have ripped us off for years, like nobody's ever been ripped off before, they're now having to pay up. They're paying a lot of… They're paying a lot of money to America, and we're reducing taxes with that money and we're doing things that we were never able to do before.\n\n(27:20)So you're going to have a lot of jobs. The jobs are being created right now. And the tariffs, the tariffs are protecting our country. Tariffs were used against us, but we didn't use them against others. But we're really better at it than anybody else. And we've taken in… We will have taken in trillions of dollars. Nobody's ever seen anything… Even people that were against the tariffs, now they see the way they work.\n\n(27:46)And by the way, with no inflation, with no problem. We're just building up cash and we're using that cash to reduce taxes, reduce debt and other things. It's a great thing to watch. And your honest reporters are saying they've never seen anything like what's happening. Our country is becoming very rich again, only because of tariffs. If we didn't have it… If I didn't get elected, this country would be… It was a dead country. Look, we were a dead country a year ago, and now we're the most successful, most vibrant country anywhere in the world.\n\nSpeaker 12 (28:23):\n\nQuestion about health, healthcare.\n\nDonald Trump (28:28):\n\n[inaudible 00:28:27] to see you. You look good on television.\n\nSpeaker 12 (28:28):\n\nThank you, sir. I try. Tonight, in a few minutes, Steve Bannon will appear on my show. He quotes the idea that you should \"Dual hack\" Secretary of Treasury, Scott Bessent, not only as Treasury Secretary, but as interim Fed Chair. Would you be willing to entertain that?\n\nDonald Trump (28:42):\n\nIn other words, he likes Scott?\n\nSpeaker 12 (28:44):\n\nYes, sir. Very much.\n\nDonald Trump (28:45):\n\nSo do I. And I like Steve, too.\n\nSpeaker 12 (28:47):\n\nWould you like to see that, him dual [inaudible 00:28:49]-\n\nDonald Trump (28:49):\n\nWell, it's certainly interesting, a dual hack. We could save a little bit of salary. I think I could maybe make a deal where we just give him one salary. I have a couple of them.\n\nSpeaker 12 (28:56):\n\nI don't think you need to.\n\nDonald Trump (28:57):\n\nI have Marco. No, I don't think so. We have Marco, he's got about three positions. He's doing great, also. No, no, I don't think that's going to be… Actually, I went to Scott and I talked to him about that position and he loves what he's doing right now. So he's not in the mix because he's… He loves being Secretary of the Treasury.\n\nSpeaker 12 (29:21):\n\nQuick follow-up. Today is the first day of early voting in the Commonwealth of Virginia. Are you planning on campaigning for Winsome Sears, John Reid, or Jason Miyares?\n\nDonald Trump (29:27):\n\nWell, I'm going to have to look at some of them. As you know, it's sort of a semi-local election. I've been watching it. I've been seeing the-\n\nSpeaker 12 (29:36):\n\nWell, I would appreciate it as a Virginia voter, just-\n\nDonald Trump (29:38):\n\nWho do you like of the group? Who do you like?\n\nSpeaker 12 (29:38):\n\nThe whole ticket, sir.\n\nDonald Trump (29:40):\n\nAll of them? You like them?\n\nSpeaker 12 (29:41):\n\nAll of them. Yes, sir.\n\nDonald Trump (29:41):\n\nAll right. I'll take a very strong look.\n\nSpeaker 12 (29:41):\n\nThank you, sir. Appreciate that.\n\nDonald Trump (29:41):\n\nFor you, I'm going to look.\n\nSpeaker 13 (29:50):\n\nSecretary Kennedy's panel on vaccine changed its broad recommendations on COVID-19 vaccines today. Are you comfortable with that change, or would you like to see Americans take the vaccines that were\n\nSpeaker 13 (30:00):\n\n… developed under your tenure.\n\nDonald Trump (30:01):\n\nYeah, well, the vaccines, according to a lot of people, and if you look at, George said, \"Have had a tremendous…\" Operation Warp Speed, it was just according to just about everybody, it was one of the greatest things that any president has ever done in this country. So we're very proud of it. I'm very proud of it. I'm also very proud of Regeneron and some of the things that came out of all of the labs and all of the research that we've done. So I don't know exactly what the final determination is, but I had the vaccine. I was very happy with it. Here I am, right. Here I am.\n\nSpeaker 18 (30:33):\n\nSir, will you just [inaudible 00:30:35]-\n\nSpeaker 15 (30:33):\n\nHave you-\n\nSpeaker 19 (30:33):\n\nBobby Kennedy [inaudible 00:30:36]-\n\nSpeaker 15 (30:33):\n\n… had [inaudible 00:30:36] recently?\n\nSpeaker 19 (30:36):\n\nBobby Kennedy seems to be undoing what you did with Operation Warp Speed.\n\nDonald Trump (30:41):\n\nNo, I put it in there because I want to have opposite views. That's okay. I think we're going to have something very, very big coming up soon on autism. Autism is totally out of control and one of the biggest, one of the most important things that in my opinion I had to do is to see what's going on with autism. We're going to have a news conference early next week on autism, and I think you can see some things that are amazing that we've learned that somebody else wouldn't have learned. It's out of control, autism, out of control, and I think we maybe have the reason why.\n\nSpeaker 19 (31:16):\n\nBut is Bobby Kennedy going too far and unwinding the vaccines and-\n\nDonald Trump (31:23):\n\nNo, no. He's saying for older people-\n\nSpeaker 19 (31:24):\n\n… [inaudible 00:31:25] vaccine?\n\nDonald Trump (31:24):\n\nYeah. He's saying for older people. A lot of people agree with that. But I can tell you this, Operation Warp Speed, one of the greatest things a president has ever done for this country. And you can say the world, because when we came up with that vaccine, the whole world opened up. But I put Bobby there as somebody that will go either way from… And I want the facts, but I also look at facts from Pfizer where they spend a lot of money on the other drug companies. They spent a lot of money on finding out the results after the fact, and the results were amazingly good.\n\nSpeaker 20 (32:01):\n\nMr. President, after normalization with-\n\nSpeaker 21 (32:04):\n\n[inaudible 00:32:04].\n\nSpeaker 16 (32:04):\n\nI'm wondering if you've seen the video point out by former Israeli hostages. It's addressed to you. One is a widow of one that died, and these are people who are freed thanks to you, but they're actually encouraging you to force a ceasefire, force Netanyahu to ceasefire, and they didn't address it to him because they think you're the one who might actually listen to them and get it done. They're worried that the hostages who are still there are more at risk if the war continues. Your thoughts on it [inaudible 00:32:37]-\n\nDonald Trump (32:37):\n\nWell, they might be. They also, maybe they'll be free because of that. You never know how it's going to look. War I was saying is… War, a lot of strange things happen. A lot of results take place that you would never think were going to happen. As you know, I was able to get most of the hostages out. We're down to 20 and we have 32 dead people. We have 32, maybe more 38, but between 32 and 38 people that were dead. Mostly young people. And I've dealt with some of the parents and we got all our Americans out as you know. And now we're talking about mostly Israelis, but I dealt with parents. I spoke to parents and they want the body of their son believe it, almost all cases sons, but they want the body of their cherished beautiful son. They want the body back as much as though he were alive.\n\n(33:24)It's so sad to see. But I've dealt with the mothers and fathers. \"Please, sir. Please, sir. The body of my son.\" They know he's dead and they just want him back. They want him back as much as though he is alive. I mean, it's very terrible. And we have very close to 40 bodies that are included in the whole thing. But we have 20, probably 20 that are living. It might be a little bit less because a couple of things. Look, young people don't die, okay. They just don't die. And they can take a lot. But a lot of people have died in these horrible tunnels. They're mostly in the tunnels. I know a lot about it. I got them out. I got them out. I always said the last 20 when you get down to the last 10 or 20, it's going to be very tough. It's a nasty situation. You can't forget October 7th, but it's a nasty situation. Terrible. Terrible.\n\nSpeaker 17 (34:24):\n\nMr. President, in Gaza, the UN concluded this week that Israel committed genocide in Gaza. What are your thoughts on that?\n\nDonald Trump (34:33):\n\nWell, I haven't seen that. I'm looking at it, but did anybody commit genocide on October 7th? What do you think about that? That was genocide at the highest level. That was murder, genocide. You can call it whatever you want, little babies were chopped in half-\n\nSpeaker 17 (34:51):\n\nAnd in Gaza?\n\nDonald Trump (34:52):\n\n… arms were cut off, people heads were cut off people. That's genocide. That's genocide, also, I guess, right.\n\nSpeaker 17 (34:54):\n\nWhat do you think [inaudible 00:34:55] image of Gazans [inaudible 00:34:55]-\n\nSpeaker 22 (34:54):\n\nPresident-\n\nSpeaker 14 (34:54):\n\nMr. President, I have a question on your [inaudible 00:34:55]-\n\nSpeaker 22 (34:55):\n\n… TikTok, you referred to getting a fee for that deal, what is that fee is going to be? [inaudible 00:35:05]-\n\nDonald Trump (35:05):\n\nWell, it hasn't been fully negotiated, but we'll get something from the standpoint that we worked hard. We put up a lot, we spent a lot of money on letting this come and letting this… It's a very, very big deal. It's a very powerful deal. And the United States really, I see it. People were saying, \"Save TikTok. Save TikTok.\" So many people. It's a big thing. And China can be very proud that they were able to get that started. And so I very much appreciate President Xi's working with us on that, very much.\n\nSpeaker 22 (35:45):\n\nBut the point here [inaudible 00:35:46]-\n\nSpeaker 17 (35:45):\n\n[inaudible 00:35:46].\n\nSpeaker 23 (35:45):\n\n[inaudible 00:35:46].\n\nSpeaker 24 (35:46):\n\nMr. President, on Antifa, what comes next after designating Antifa a terrorist organization?\n\nDonald Trump (35:50):\n\nWell, there are others that we're going to designate too, but we're going to look at the people that funded Antifa, see who they are, where they came from and why they did. Have you seen Portland at all? Have you take a look at what's happening in Portland? I mean, this has been going on for years. It's just people out of control. They're crazy. We're going to stop that very soon. We have to get rid of a couple of other problems first. We're going to get rid of the problems in Memphis where you can't even walk a block without getting shot. We're going to get rid of the problems in Chicago. Chicago's a great city and we have to save it. We have to save it. I told you, I had the head of the Union Pacific Railroad in my office and I said, \"So what do you think? You go to every city. You have railroads in every [inaudible 00:36:32] biggest railroad, beautiful railroad. He's a great guy.\"\n\n(36:35)I said, \"What do you think?\" He said, \"Sir, save Chicago. Don't let it go down. Save it.\" The way he said it was so meaningful to me. It was so, like, it was terrible. In a way it was terrible. \"Save Chicago.\" Who would ever think that we'd be sitting here talking about saving Chicago? Chicago's a great city. They have a terrible mayor. Terrible. He's like 5% approval rating, he's an incompetent person. They have an incompetent governor in my opinion. He's incompetent. 11 people gets shot and he says, \"Crime is in a good shape.\" I mean, they're losing 4, 5, 6 people a week getting killed by bullets, by knives. And then he says, how wonderful it is, Chicago, so… Well, it might be wonderful for him. I think they're afraid. Look, he's not a stupid guy. I really believe they're afraid to say, politically, I guess, from an ideology standpoint, from a democratic standpoint, he's afraid.\n\n(37:41)He's afraid to say the fact that they have a very unsafe, very dangerous city. He should say, \"I'm going to call President Donald Trump and I'm going to ask him to send in the troops, to send him the National Guard and clean this hellhole up,\" because Chicago can be a great city again. I'll tell you what, Washington, D.C. is a great place again. It's booming and the restaurants are booming. And six months ago, seven months ago, nobody could go outside and even just walking around the White House, people here are thanking me for what I've done. They're thanking me. They're saying, \"Thank you.\" I almost know what they mean because they can walk to work. And even when they took Uber and they took other forms of transportation, they felt unsafe because the car was hijacked while they're in there. They take a car and it's being hijacked as they get into the car. And they did that for safety. And now we have a safe place here. We've taken 1,500 people out of, career criminals that been taken out Washington, D.C. and we weren't very nice about it.\n\nSpeaker 24 (38:44):\n\nDo you know [inaudible 00:38:49]-\n\nSpeaker 17 (38:44):\n\n[inaudible 00:38:47].\n\nSpeaker 14 (38:44):\n\nMr. President [inaudible 00:38:54]-\n\nSpeaker 25 (38:44):\n\nMr. President [inaudible 00:38:52] China-\n\nSpeaker 26 (38:44):\n\nYou mentioned that rail merger, did you discuss it the Union Pacific [inaudible 00:38:56]-\n\nDonald Trump (38:57):\n\nI did. I did discuss it and I don't want to make a comment on it, but the Union Pacific is a great railroad and they want to add a railroad that had a mistake out of a place very close to my heart. A lot of people say that that was a place where I got off to a very good start. It was a rough thing that happened. Well, they're trying to buy that railroad that had the problem. And it sounds good to me, to be honest with you. It sounds good to me. I'm a very big fan of the head of the railroad, the head of the Union Pacific. He started as a very low on the totem pole, started his job very low and became the chairman of the company over a 45-year period. But I asked him about different cities. He said, \"St. Louis is tough. We try…\" He's going to stop many of them.\n\nSpeaker 25 (39:47):\n\nMr. President [inaudible 00:39:53]-\n\nDonald Trump (39:54):\n\nNew Orleans, we have to save New Orleans.\n\nSpeaker 27 (39:55):\n\nNew York.\n\nSpeaker 25 (39:56):\n\nMr. President-\n\nSpeaker 28 (39:57):\n\nMr. President, when are you going to give details on Memphis?\n\nDonald Trump (40:02):\n\nWe're going to be going into New York too.\n\nSpeaker 28 (40:02):\n\nMr. President-\n\nDonald Trump (40:02):\n\nAnd we're going to be going in… Quiet. You're really obnoxious.\n\nSpeaker 28 (40:04):\n\nI'm not obnoxious, but I'm trying to ask you, what about your plans for Memphis?\n\nDonald Trump (40:06):\n\nYou are really obnoxious.\n\nSpeaker 28 (40:06):\n\nI'm not obnoxious.\n\nDonald Trump (40:06):\n\nOkay.\n\nSpeaker 28 (40:06):\n\nBut I'm asking, what are you plans for Memphis?\n\nDonald Trump (40:10):\n\nOkay.\n\nSpeaker 28 (40:10):\n\nMany people want to know what the numbers are going to be like-\n\nDonald Trump (40:10):\n\nI'm not going to talk to you until I call on you.\n\nSpeaker 28 (40:10):\n\nWhat are your plans for Memphis, Mr. President?\n\nDonald Trump (40:18):\n\nSo who else? Yeah, go ahead.\n\nJohn (40:18):\n\nYeah. I just want to sell this free speech question, 'cause you've said that you restored free speech in America.\n\nDonald Trump (40:23):\n\nYeah.\n\nJohn (40:23):\n\nIs that free speech, including for people who are harshly critical of you for your political opponents, for people who say things you don't like-\n\nDonald Trump (40:32):\n\nI've become immune to it.\n\nJohn (40:33):\n\n… who treat you unfairly?\n\nDonald Trump (40:34):\n\nI've become immune to it. There's never been a person that's had more unfair publicity than me. And that's why your network paid me $15 million or $16 million, I believe, to be exact. George Slopadopolus. And that's why CBS paid me a lot of money too. And that's why I sued the New York Times two days ago for a lot of money-\n\nJohn (40:51):\n\nThe judge [inaudible 00:40:52]-\n\nDonald Trump (40:53):\n\n… because… Well, I'm winning. I mean, I'm winning the cases. And the reason I'm winning is because you're guilty, John. You're guilty. ABC is a terrible network, a very unfair network, and you should be ashamed of yourself. NBC is equally bad. I don't know who's worse. I think they're equally bad. And for you to stand there and act so innocent and ask me a question like that. But look, you paid a big price because you were dishonest, John. The reason I won that lawsuit is because you were dishonest. You were proven to be dishonest. And so you can't sit back and just say, \"Oh, well what do you think…\" Like, you're some wonderful person. You're not a wonderful person. Frankly, you're a terrible reporter. You know it, and so do I.\n\nSpeaker 29 (41:33):\n\nMr. President-\n\nSpeaker 30 (41:33):\n\nMr. President, can you talk about why the-\n\nSpeaker 31 (41:33):\n\nMr. President [inaudible 00:41:34]-\n\nDonald Trump (41:33):\n\nHere's what we're going to do. .\n\nSpeaker 30 (41:33):\n\n… justice department [inaudible 00:41:36]-\n\nDonald Trump (41:38):\n\nHere's what we're going to do. We're going to talk about something that's going to reduce our taxes greatly. That's going to hopefully bring some great people into our country. As you know, right now, nobody's coming in because we've succeeded in closing… We've closed the border very successfully, I think you'll agree. We had nobody coming for the last few months. I mean, it was actually said zero. Even I can't believe zero. But the numbers are put out by very impartial people or people that have a tendency to be on the left. And they actually said for the last three months, nobody came in. We have a very strong border. It's a closed border. People are coming into our country, but they're coming in legally. It's a beautiful thing to watch, but we are doing something where rather than coming into the border… 25 million people came into our country during Biden.\n\n(42:29)One of the saddest things. The worst thing… Look, he was horrible in inflation. He was horrible in just about everything you could be. I don't think he was good on… He wasn't even fair on anything. It was a horrible administration. He was the worst president in the history of our country. And we have to mop it up. The hardest thing that we have to do is to get rid of the criminals that he allowed into our country, from prisons, from mental institutions, gang members, drug dealers. And we're getting them out and we're getting them out fast and we're making America safe again, great again, but we're making America safe again. And it's an honor to do it. But this is something… This is an unforced era, what they've done. It's just an unforced era. So I'm going to ask Howard to speak. Howard's done a fantastic job as you know, Secretary of Commerce, and I'm going to ask Howard and Will, could you just give a quick description of what we're doing and what we're signing, et cetera?\n\nWill (43:31):\n\nYes, sir.\n\nDonald Trump (43:31):\n\nAnd I will do that. Go ahead.\n\nWill (43:33):\n\nWe have two items for your attention today, sir. A major focus of your administration has been shifting the conversation and shifting the policy dynamics around the issue of immigration, closing the border, preventing illegal immigration, but also as is the case with the executive order in front of you, opening new pathways for truly extraordinary people to come contribute to America instead of taking away from it. So this executive order is entitled the Gold Card. It will set up a new pathway, a new visa pathway for foreigners of extraordinary ability who are committed to supporting the United States for a payment of $1 million to the US Treasury, or if a corporation is sponsoring them $2 million by that corporation. And that will give them access to expedited visa treatment as part of this new gold card program.\n\nDonald Trump (44:21):\n\nAnd one of the biggest problems we have is that people, they go to the best schools and they do great and they get great marks and then they're thrown out of the country, you're not allowed to stay. This way, a corporation will be able, sort of like a signing bonus in baseball or football, a corporation will be able to get them to stay in the country, and I think it's going to be tremendously successful. Howard, would you say a few words there, please?\n\nHoward Lutnick (44:45):\n\nSure. So historically, the employment-based green card program let in 281,000 people a year, and those people on average, earned $66,000\n\nHoward Lutnick (45:00):\n\n… dollars a year on average. And they were five times more likely to go on assistance programs of the government. So we were taking in the bottom quartile below the average American. It was illogical. The only country in the world that was taking in the bottom quartile.\n\n(45:20)So what we are doing now is we are going to stop doing that. We're going to only take extraordinary people at the very top. Instead of people trying to take the jobs from Americans, they're going to create businesses and create jobs for Americans. And this program will raise more than $100 billion for the Treasury of the United States of America.\n\nDonald Trump (45:42):\n\nWhich we'll use for cutting taxes and paying down debt. We think it's going to be very successful. Essentially, we're having people come in, people that in many cases, I guess, they're very successful or whatever. And they're coming in, they're going to spend a lot of money to come in. They're going to pay as opposed to walking over the borders. And they may come from jails, prisons and everything else. These people don't. They're very productive people, and they're going to pay a million dollars. A corporation is going to pay $2 million and it's going to raise billions of dollars, billions and billions of dollars, which is going to go to reduce taxes, pay off debt, and other good things. So I think it's going to be very successful.\n\nSpeaker 32 (46:26):\n\nAre the big techs on board with these, Mr. President?\n\nDonald Trump (46:27):\n\nWhat?\n\nSpeaker 32 (46:27):\n\nThe big techs, are the big techs on board with the decision you just-\n\nDonald Trump (46:29):\n\nWhat's going to … Well, what's going … I wish you'd speak more clearly. I really … Give it to me again.\n\nSpeaker 32 (46:38):\n\nAre the big techs, the CEOs on board with these decisions?\n\nDonald Trump (46:38):\n\nBig tax?\n\nSpeaker 32 (46:38):\n\nBig tech.\n\nSpeaker 33 (46:44):\n\nBig tech, tech companies. Big tech companies.\n\nDonald Trump (46:44):\n\nYeah, big tech. Yeah, big tech, it's every company. It's big tech. It's big tech. It's big everything.\n\nSpeaker 33 (46:50):\n\nDo you think the CEOs will [inaudible 00:46:51]\n\nDonald Trump (46:50):\n\nIt's a company. I said it. It's not a tech company. It's tech companies and everything else. It's companies having a hard time at getting people to be able to stay in the country. It's very difficult. Now, if you want to walk through the border, you can have no problem. People say, \"Well, the best way to come in is walk right through the border.\" But they can't do that anymore because under our administration, the border is totally closed. You can only come in if you come in legally. And that's the way it's been and that's the way it should be.\n\n(47:20)And we're taking a lot of people out of the country that are here from prisons, from jails, from mental institutions, and even insane asylums, people that are crazy. We're taking them out of the country. We're getting them out of the country 'cause you can't have a country like that.\n\n(47:33)And I tell you, Kristi and Tom Homan and all of the people that have worked so hard on this, they've done an unbelievable job. And I think we're getting great books where people feel safe. Washington DC is just the beginning. Other, we brought the numbers down in Chicago a little bit by having the FBI in there for the last five months. We brought the numbers down in Memphis a little bit, but now we're going for the big one. Now we're going to go for the big one. But we set ourselves up very well in Chicago, Memphis, New Orleans, a little bit going in early, just to see what was happening. We study it. We're studying the site. It's sort of like war. I mean, I hate to tell you, it's like war.\n\n(48:14)Some of these people are really bad. They're really, really sick people. They're dangerous people. They're killers, they're murderers, drug dealers. And can't have it. You can't have a country like that. It's so beautiful to see Washington DC that people are walking down the middle of the street and they're going to restaurants and you are too. And half of you were mugged. I mean, I don't know if she's here now, I don't see her, but some people were badly mugged that were reporters. Two of the people standing in the back of the room were mugged and they aren't going to have that anymore.\n\n(48:51)And if you look at the crime stats in Washington DC, you have a safe place again. They were afraid to go to a restaurant because the restaurant would be held up while they're having dinner. And so they'd be mugged going there and assuming they escaped the mugging, they go to the restaurant and then they're held up. This is how bad it's been.\n\n(49:10)Yeah?\n\nSpeaker 34 (49:10):\n\nTo follow-up on the visa question. I think this may be the next thing that you're signing, but for the H-1B visa action that you're doing-\n\nDonald Trump (49:16):\n\nThat's going to be next. We'll talk about that.\n\nSpeaker 34 (49:17):\n\nYou're very close to the technology CEOs. Are they concerned about that?\n\nDonald Trump (49:22):\n\nI think they're going to be very happy. Everyone's going to be happy and we're going to be able to keep people in our country that are going to be very productive people. And in many cases these companies are going to pay a lot of money for that and they're very happy about it. Okay, we'll talk about that next. Okay.\n\n(49:35)My friend, why don't you keep that? Okay?\n\nHoward Lutnick (49:35):\n\nThank you.\n\nDonald Trump (49:35):\n\nDone such a good job. Okay. This is phase one. John, are you happy?\n\nSpeaker 35 (49:48):\n\nSure.\n\nDonald Trump (49:48):\n\nOkay. Okay. Let's go.\n\nSpeaker 36 (50:00):\n\nThank you, Mr. President. One of the most abused visa systems in our current immigration system has been the H-1B non-immigrant visa program. This is supposed to allow highly skilled laborers who work in fields that Americans don't work in to come into the United States of America.\n\n(50:17)What this proclamation will do is raise the fee that companies pay to sponsor H-1B applicants to $100,000. This will ensure that the people they're bringing in are actually very highly skilled and that they're not replaceable by American workers. So it'll protect American workers, but ensure that companies have a pathway to hire truly extraordinary people and bring them to the United States to work.\n\nDonald Trump (50:41):\n\nWe need workers. We need workers. We need great workers. And this pretty much ensures that that's what's going to happen. I think, Sean, do you agree with it?\n\nHoward Lutnick (50:49):\n\nWell, they're $100,000 per year. So the whole idea is no more will these big tech companies or other big companies train foreign workers. They have to pay the government $100,000. Then they have to pay the employee. So it's just not economic. If you're going to train somebody, you're going to train one of the recent graduates from one of the great universities across our land, train Americans, stop bringing in people to take our jobs. That's the policy here. $100,000 a year for H-1B visas and all of the big companies are on board. We've spoken to them about the golden card.\n\nDonald Trump (51:29):\n\nThey love it. They love it. They really love it. They need it. Go ahead, Sean.\n\nSpeaker 36 (51:34):\n\nMr. President, it seems like there's two categories of visa programs, the H-1B that a lot of people believe take American jobs and then the Gold Card and programs like EB-5 that add value and jobs to America. Is that sort of how you look at the visa program?\n\nDonald Trump (51:45):\n\nWell, ideally, look, if somebody's got the people, they're not going to want to spend $100,000 as an example in your second category. So it's not taking jobs. And we need certain jobs, we need certain skilled jobs that we don't have, but they won't be taking jobs because ideally the people aren't going to want to, they're not going to-\n\nSpeaker 36 (52:01):\n\nIt looks like a lot people investing in America and creating jobs, so that's why I'm asking-\n\nDonald Trump (52:01):\n\nThey're really investing.\n\nSpeaker 36 (52:11):\n\nIt seems like you have two categories. One, that Secretary of Lutnick's, the Gold Card and EB-5 that create jobs and investment. And then there's other ones that seem to take, whether it's a J-1 and O or an H-1B that take US jobs.\n\nDonald Trump (52:21):\n\nYeah. It's pretty correct. I mean, I would say that's a correct assessment. But the main thing is we're going to have great people coming in and they're going to be paying. I mean, it's wonderful to say, \"Oh gee,\" versus … We took in 25 million people that … Look, many criminals. Jails were open for Venezuela, for many other countries, and they were let out of jail and poured into our country. Our poor country how it suffered with this stupid president that we had and the stupid people that surrounded him right around his desk. These liberal crazy people that have destroyed, they could have destroyed. If we didn't win this election, our country would've been dead. Our country was dead. Think of it. And I've said this. The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia said, your country was dead one year. They thought it was dead. This country couldn't have survived another year of those people running it.\n\n(53:17)And now we have the hottest country anywhere in the world. Think of that. And this is going to help and we're taking in hundreds of billions of dollars. This will be taken in. The Gold Card will be taken in hundreds of billions of dollars and companies will be able to keep some people that they need. They need people of expertise, great expertise, and I think it's going to be a fantastic thing. And we're going to take that money and we're going to reduce taxes. We're going to reduce debt.\n\n(53:45)We have a very, very strong country, assuming everything works out great with the lawsuit that we have. We have a lawsuit that's inspired by foreign countries that ripped us off for 25 years. But assuming we win that, we hopefully win it in the Supreme Court of the United States. We have a country that no stopping us. We're rich. We'll be rich. We can take care of poor people. We can take care of our military. We can take care of everything. We can take care of beyond the country. We can help take care of the world. If we don't, it'll just be the same struggle that we've had for years where other countries charged us tariffs and they ripped us off. Our country has been ripped off more than any country in the history of the world and now we are doing what we have to do. We're taking in billions and billions of dollars at levels that nobody has ever seen, trillions of dollars, and we're using it to reduce debt. We're using it to reduce taxes.\n\n(54:48)The Great Big Beautiful Bill is a big tax reduction. It's being paid for by the tariffs and people are paying a lot less money in taxes. They're being … Think of it. No tax on tips. No tax on social security. No tax on overtime. It's an unbelievable phenomenon. It really is. It's the golden age. We're making it the golden age. Without the tariffs, it would be impossible.\n\n(55:14)And China for years charged us tariffs and they continue to do it and so do other countries. Most countries, they charged us, they were ripping … Look, the European Union, as you know, I get along very well with them, but they ripped us off so badly. Nobody's ever seen anything. Now the European Union's paying us $950 billion and they're paying us 750 billion to buy our energy and they're okay with it. They signed the agreement. It's not like anybody forced them to do it. They're okay with it.\n\n(55:46)Tariffs are making our country very rich again, and we'll be able to take care of our debt. We'll be able to take care of our taxes, lower taxes. We'll be able to take care of Medicare, Medicaid, social security. We're going to be a rich country again. Without tariffs, we'd be in very big trouble.\n\nSpeaker 37 (56:04):\n\nMr. President.\n\nSpeaker 38 (56:04):\n\nMr. President.\n\nSpeaker 39 (56:10):\n\nMr. President. Do you want Europe to pay 100% tariffs on China?\n\nSpeaker 37 (56:12):\n\nExcuse me. H-1Bs are sometimes used by people already in the country legally on other visas or student visas. Does this apply to them or to renewals or does it only apply to people applying for the first time from abroad?\n\nHoward Lutnick (56:22):\n\nRenewals, first times. The company needs to decide, do they want, is the person valuable enough to have $100,000 a year payment to the government or they should head home and they should go hire an American.\n\nSpeaker 37 (56:39):\n\nIt's an annual fee?\n\nHoward Lutnick (56:39):\n\nThe whole idea, it's annual, and it's for total, it can be a total of six years, so $100,000 a year. So either the person is very valuable to the company and America or they're going to depart, and the company's going to hire an American. And that's the point of immigration, hire Americans and make sure the people coming in are the top, top people. Stop the nonsense of letting people just come into this country on these visas that were given away for free. The President is crystal clear. Valuable people only for America. Stop the nonsense.\n\nSpeaker 37 (57:15):\n\n[inaudible 00:57:16]\n\nDonald Trump (57:15):\n\nAnd remember, the country-\n\nSpeaker 37 (57:16):\n\n[inaudible 00:57:16] is just a fee, right?\n\nHoward Lutnick (57:20):\n\nYeah, fee to America.\n\nDonald Trump (57:20):\n\nThe country would rather not have to pay $100,000, but they'd rather, how do you do that? You hire American. So there's an incentive to hire American. But there may be instances where it's better off doing through expertise or whatever it may be. But they're both unbelievable, whether it's a Gold Card or anything else that we talked about today. And that includes talking about freedom of speech because our country has been decimated by bad people, very bad people. People that love crime, they love crime.\n\n(57:54)Explain it to me. They don't want to have our military go in and save lives. But when you go and ask the people, Do you mind having the National Guard come in if it meant safety?\" They look at the question like, \"what's wrong? What kind of a stupid question is that?\" Of course they do. We're going to have a safe country again. We're not going to have people shot. 11 people shot. Think of it.\n\n(58:18)In Chicago over a period of six or seven weeks, 55 people were murdered. And then you have a governor saying how wonderful it is. It's not wonderful. It's very unsafe. There's not a place in the world. You go outside, you go to Afghanistan, you go to different places all over the world that you hear about. It's 20% of what's happening in places like Chicago and you think of them as unsafe. Mexico City. Mexico City is a tough place, dangerous place. The crime rate is lower. Think of it, what's happening to our country, we're not going to let it happen. And I think I got elected largely for that reason.\n\n(58:59)So we're going to have a safe country again. We're going to have a great country again. We're doing unbelievably. We have the highest stock market in history. We have the most investment we've ever had ever as a country coming in. And we're very simple. They said, \"How'd you get elected?\" I got elected because I'm going to make America great again. That's what we're doing. We're making America great again. Thank you very much everybody.\n\nSpeaker 40 (59:22):\n\nThank you press. Thank you press. Thanks guys. [inaudible 00:59:25]",

    "transcript": "President Donald Trump (00:12):\n\nThank you very much. It's a great pleasure to have President Nawrocki with us, of Poland. He did a good job with that, right? Can be a little different pronunciation, I said, I want to get it perfect. Did I get it right?\n\nPreseident Karol Nawrocki (00:25):\n\nYeah, good, good. Nawrocki.\n\nPresident Donald Trump (00:29):\n\nAnd the president's been amazing. He had an incredible race. He came from behind and he won very handily. The people of Poland have taken to him immediately, they really love him. There's great love and respect. He's a very successful man, but he went into a political hatchet, so to speak. It was a pretty tough race, pretty nasty race, and he beat them all and he beat them all very easily. And now he's become even more popular as they got to know him and know him better. He is doing a really fantastic job, so it's an honor to, I also endorsed him, so I'm very proud of that.\n\n(01:07)I don't endorse too many people, but I endorsed him and I was very proud of that, the job he's done. And I want to thank Vince Haley for that recommendation. Vince was fantastic and I appreciate it and I can tell you who really appreciates it, Poland, because they're very happy with their president. And I just want to say it's an honor to have you, we'll be discussing trade and various other things, the things that you discuss. We'll have a few questions from you and then we'll get onto a discussion then we'll have lunch and then he goes, and he meets with the Pope and that'll be very exciting. And say hello to the Pope for me.\n\nPreseident Karol Nawrocki (01:40):\n\nYeah, I will. Thank you.\n\nPresident Donald Trump (01:41):\n\nThank you very much for being here.\n\nPreseident Karol Nawrocki (01:42):\n\nThank you very much.\n\nPresident Donald Trump (01:43):\n\nThank you very much Mr. President.\n\nPreseident Karol Nawrocki (01:44):\n\nMr. President, thank you very much. I would like to express my gratitude for your invitation only after one month from my sworn, in sworn and from celebration for my inauguration. It means that the Polish American relations are very important, very strong. I think that we have so strong relations that we have never had and it's very important for me. Our relations are based of course on the values. Thank you very much for your support, for your endorsement during my very hard campaign. I remember it and I'm very grateful for your support. It was the fight me against others, so your support was very important. And the support of Polish people, Polish diaspora in United States of America, we have almost more than 10 million people here. And they voted for Donald Trump.\n\nPresident Donald Trump (02:43):\n\nThey voted for me, I will say.\n\nPreseident Karol Nawrocki (02:45):\n\nAnd in vast majority, they voted also for me. So I would like to say hello to Polish diaspora in United States of America. Those relations for me, for Poland, for Poles are very important with United States of America. And they are based on values, independence, sovereignty, democracy. And I think Mr. president, that those values are epitomized by our common heroes.\n\nPresident Donald Trump (03:12):\n\nYes.\n\nPreseident Karol Nawrocki (03:12):\n\nKazimierz Pułaski, Tadeusz Kościuszko.\n\nPresident Donald Trump (03:14):\n\nThat's right.\n\nPreseident Karol Nawrocki (03:15):\n\nSo, thank you very much. And I hope it'll be very fruitful discussion around the [inaudible 00:03:21], around the economy and military service.\n\nPresident Donald Trump (03:25):\n\nAnd the flyover was very much in honor of your great pilot who just passed away recently, who was a legend in Poland. You might want to say something about him?\n\nPreseident Karol Nawrocki (03:33):\n\nYes, of course. It was the terrific accident in Poland. Thank you for this gesture that F-35 opened our meeting. Mayor Krakowian was one of the best Polish pilots, well-honed Polish pilots, and he died. He lost two children, so it was a great tragedy in Poland.\n\nPresident Donald Trump (04:00):\n\nHe was a legend in Poland actually, a legend as a pilot. He was an incredible pilot and I think he went to the Air Force Academy actually. But he was a fantastic pilot and it was a big, big setback. People of Poland are very, very sad. So, we thought we'd do that. That was the single plane that swooped up.\n\nPreseident Karol Nawrocki (04:19):\n\nYeah. And machines, American machines opened our meeting, it was great. And we are waiting for F-35 in Poland, so it also shows that we have great relations according to the best military equipment on the world, american equipment, which shield Polish security too.\n\nPresident Donald Trump (04:40):\n\nWell, Poland, we've had a tremendous relationship. I think now it's better than ever because of this relationship. It's a little special because we fought together, but we've always been very good and we have some wonderful people. As you know, Duda, my friend, he's a good man and still a big fan of yours, very much so. So, it's great honor, and we're going to talk about trade, we'll talk about some other things. We'll take a couple of questions from the media.\n\nSpeaker 1 (05:10):\n\nWill American soldiers remain in Poland? Will American soldiers remain in Poland?\n\nPresident Donald Trump (05:16):\n\nYeah, I think so. I mean, do you know something I don't? I don't know.\n\nSpeaker 1 (05:19):\n\nAny words about…\n\nPresident Donald Trump (05:20):\n\nWe're very happy. If anything, we will put more there if they want, but they've long wanted to have a larger presence. We have some countries that have more, not too many, but no, they'll be staying in Poland. We're very much aligned with Poland.\n\nSpeaker 1 (05:34):\n\nThank you…\n\nSpeaker 2 (05:37):\n\nCertainly [inaudible 00:05:37] that. We saw a dramatic picture where we saw the leaders of Russia and North Korea and China together the first time the leaders of those three countries have been together to show of solidarity. You said that they're conspiring against the United States. What do you think they're conspiring to do? And given this, is it reason why you should slap or would consider slapping secondary sanctions on Russia if they're conspiring against the US now?\n\nPresident Donald Trump (06:00):\n\nWell, I've already done that with regard to India, and we're doing it with regard to other things, and I put out a Truth last night, you saw that, and I was the one that brought it up. I said, they're only doing this, they're really there looking to… When they did what they did, I thought it was a beautiful ceremony, I thought it was very, very impressive. But I understood the reason they were doing it and they were hoping I was watching and I was watching. My relationship with all of them is very good. We're going to find out how good it is over the next week or two.\n\n(06:33)I think that we helped China very much as you know when they talk about freedom. And I don't believe that, and maybe I'm wrong, I hope I'm wrong, but I don't believe that America, that the United States was acknowledged for helping China to gain its freedom. But perhaps that was a sleight of hand. I mean, I was very surprised. I watched the speech last night. President Xi is a friend of mine, but I thought that the United States should have been mentioned last night during that speech because we helped China very, very much.\n\nSpeaker 3 (07:11):\n\n[inaudible 00:07:11] invited you, Mr. President? [inaudible 00:07:12] Many times President Xi [inaudible 00:07:13] invited you?\n\nSpeaker 4 (07:17):\n\nYou've expressed many times your frustration and disappointment with Putin, but there's no action since you took your office. Don't you worry that…\n\nPresident Donald Trump (07:26):\n\nHow do you know there's no action?\n\nSpeaker 4 (07:28):\n\nBut don't you worry?\n\nPresident Donald Trump (07:29):\n\nWait a minute.\n\nSpeaker 4 (07:30):\n\nWhat actions did you take?\n\nPresident Donald Trump (07:31):\n\nWho are you with?\n\nSpeaker 4 (07:32):\n\nI'm with Polish Radio.\n\nPresident Donald Trump (07:33):\n\nOkay, how do you know there's no action? Would you say that putting secondary sanctions on India, the largest purchaser outside of China, they're almost equal, would you say there was no action? That cost hundreds of billions of dollars to Russia. You call that no action? And I haven't done phase two yet, or phase three, but when you say there's no action, I think you ought to get yourself a new job. Because if you remember two weeks ago I did.\n\nPresident Donald Trump (08:00):\n\nI said, \"If India buys, India's got big problems.\" And that's what happened, so don't tell me about that.\n\nSpeaker 5 (08:06):\n\nMr. President, right now there have been survivors of Jeffrey Epstein speaking at a press conference on behalf of the Hill. They're calling for these case files, these documents to be released. And Thomas Massie, who is sponsoring these [inaudible 00:08:26] get the house to vote and release those documents, says he doesn't believe you're implicated in these files, but many of your friends and donors may be. And he says that's why the Justice Department is redacting them and slow-walking the release. Is the Justice Department protecting any friends or donors, sir?\n\nPresident Donald Trump (08:42):\n\nThis is a Democrat hoax that never ends. It reminds me a little of the Kennedy situation. We gave him everything over and over again, more and more and more and nobody's ever satisfied. From what I understand, I could check, but from what I understand, thousands of pages of documents have been given. But it's really a Democrat hoax because they're trying to get people to talk about something that's totally irrelevant to the success that we've had as a nation since I've been President. Even if you look at DC right now, DC, it's a totally safe zone. It's called a safe zone, that's a term. It's a term of art. It's a safe zone because it's very safe. You can walk down the street now and nothing's going to happen, no crime, no murders, no nothing.\n\n(09:31)Because we had a lot of problem with certain places and we still do, all run by Democrats or for the most part, run by Democrats. So what they're trying to do with the Epstein hoax is get people to talk about that instead of speaking about the tremendous success like ending seven wars. I ended seven wars. Nobody's going to talk about this, they're going to talk about the Epstein whatever. I understand that we were subpoenaed to give files and I understand we've given thousands of pages of files. And I know that no matter what you do, it's going to keep going. And I think really, it's enough because I think we should talk about the greatness of our country and the success that we're having. I think we're probably having, according to what I read, even from two people in this room, we're having the most successful eight months of any President ever, and that's what I want to talk about. That's what we should be talking about, not the Epstein hoax.\n\nSpeaker 7 (10:27):\n\nMr. President, what message do you have to Putin?\n\nPresident Donald Trump (10:32):\n\nI have no message to President Putin. He knows where I stand and he'll make a decision one way or the other. Whatever his decision is, we'll either be happy about it or unhappy. And if we're unhappy about it, you'll see things happen.\n\nSpeaker 6 (10:49):\n\n[inaudible 00:10:49] can you give us a sense of what the US policy or what you're trying to achieve with the aircraft carriers or the boats, I should say, near Venezuela? And also the boat that you mentioned yesterday where 11 people were killed, what was found on that boat and why were the men killed instead of taking it?\n\nPresident Donald Trump (11:05):\n\nOn the boat, you had massive amounts of drugs. We have tapes of them speaking. There was massive amounts of drugs coming into our country to kill a lot of people and everybody fully understands that. In fact, you see it. You see the bags of drugs all over the boat and they were hit. Obviously, they won't be doing it again. And I think a lot of other people won't be doing it again when they watch that tape. They're going to say, \"Let's not do this.\" We have to protect our country and we're going to. Venezuela has been a very bad actor. As you know, they've been sending millions of people into our country, many of them Tren de Aragua, some of the worst gangs, some of the worst people anywhere in the world in terms of gangs. And we had some in Washington DC, we took care of them very quickly. But they're out of here, they've gone.\n\n(11:52)But Venezuela has been very bad, both in terms of drugs and sending some of the worst criminals anywhere in the world into our country. You don't know this, but they emptied out their prisons in Venezuela and they emptied them out into the United States of America. And that's part of the problem we have, we're getting them out. We're getting them out rapidly but it's caused a tremendous problem. And Pete and all of the people that are working very hard to rectify the stupidity of the Biden administration, allowing these people to pour into our country with open borders.\n\n(12:24)We are paying a big price as a country for the incompetence of the Biden administration. But think of it, opened up prisons, drug dealers, drug lords, everything coming out of Venezuela they said, and we said we're not going to put up with it anymore. So Venezuela has been one of the worst actors in the whole group and we have a group of pretty bad actors. Go ahead.\n\nSpeaker 8 (12:49):\n\nYeah, thank you, Mr. President. At the end of this month, the government or the Congress has to pass a budget. Do you think we can avoid the government shutdown?\n\nPresident Donald Trump (12:57):\n\nYeah, I do. I think the Republicans will vote for an extension. We won't have any Democrat votes. We could give the greatest budget ever, tax cut of 50%. Everybody taken care of, perfect for women, perfect for men, perfect for minorities, perfect for everything and we wouldn't get one vote from the Democrats because they've lost their mind. They are so deranged. They have Trump Derangement Syndrome and I don't want to burn the Republican party with it, but they really are, they've become almost sick. They actually think there is a disease, it's called Trump Derangement Syndrome, they've got it.\n\n(13:34)No matter what we did, no matter how good, you could give them everything that they've ever dreamed of and you wouldn't get one vote. These are sick people and I think we're going to have a tremendous midterm. We just approved the largest tax decrease in the history of our country. We have things, if you think of it, no tax on tips, no tax on social security for our seniors, no tax on overtime. Deductions, when you buy a car and you borrow money to buy a car, first time they've ever seen anything like this, middle-income people get deductions. You get a deduction when you buy a car. Nobody's ever seen… And by the way, they're selling cars like crazy.\n\n(14:13)Cars are pouring back because of the fact that we have tariffs. Cars are pouring back into, car plants are pouring back into our nation. They're coming from all over the world, they're coming back. We lost about 54% of automobile manufacturing over a 30 year period, 35 year period. They're all coming back. I think they're coming back higher than ever before. We have AI going up. What we've done is amazing and what we've passed is amazing. But the Democrats, I don't believe will get one vote. It's very anti-crime, we want anti-crime. They're in favor of crime, we're against crime. They gave us things like men playing in women's sports, open borders for everybody, transgender for everybody.\n\n(14:59)I mean, they want to transgender for all of the crazy things that they were saying. And people would say they're 80/20 issues. I say there were 97 to three. I always say 97 to three, nobody knows who the three are. This is the best issue of all. They are against preventing crime, they are fighting us. I want to go into Chicago and they have this incompetent governor that doesn't want us. Do you know that this weekend, 72 people were shot in Chicago? I'm embarrassed to say it, in front of the President of Poland, 11 people were killed. 72 people were shot. Last week, seven people were killed in Chicago, a place which is probably your number one place, I hate to say it.\n\nPresident Nawrocki (15:42):\n\nYeah, a lot of Poles in Chicago.\n\nPresident Donald Trump (15:43):\n\nAnd we got to keep it safe, but seven people were killed. The week before that, five people were killed and 21 people were shot. This is in three weeks. So in three weeks they lost almost 35 people were killed. It could have been stopped.\n\nPresident Donald Trump (16:00):\n\nBut if you look at Washington D.C. three weeks ago, it was the same or worse, and now it's considered a totally safe zone. Restaurants are open, they're bustling. Restaurants, you have to see. Restaurants were dying. Nobody wanted to go out. They didn't want to be attacked. They didn't want to be mugged. They didn't want to be attacked even in the restaurant. And you take a look at what's happened, friends of mine that haven't gone to a restaurant in four years, one of them went out five times in the last two weeks to a restaurant with his family. They feel totally safe. Washington D.C. is a totally safe city. You're not reporting any crime because there is none. They said crime is down 87%. And I said, no, it's not. It's down 100%. We have a great thing going.\n\n(16:45)I could do that with Chicago. We could do that with New York. We could do it with Los Angeles. So we're making a determination now, do we go to Chicago or do we go to a place like New Orleans, where we have a great governor, Jeff Landry, who wants us to come in and straighten out a very nice section of this country that's become quite tough, quite bad. So we are going to be going to maybe Louisiana. And you have New Orleans, which has a crime problem. We'll straighten that out in about two weeks. It'll take us two weeks. Easier than D.C.\n\n(17:23)But we could straighten out Chicago. All they have to do is ask us to go into Chicago, if we don't have the support of some of these politicians. But I'll tell you who is supporting us, the people of Chicago, and I sort of want them to let it be known they have incompetent people.\n\n(17:41)A guy like Gavin Newscum, he's the governor of a state that if we didn't go in, if we didn't go into Los Angeles with our soldiers, with our National Guard, you wouldn't even be having the Olympics there. They were going to take it. And remember this, your top law enforcement officer in Los Angeles said there's no way we could have done this without President Trump coming in with the troops. We saved Los Angeles and we saved the Olympics.\n\n(18:08)Thank you very much.\n\nSpeaker 9 (18:15):\n\nThank you, Andrew. Thank you.\n\n(18:15)Mr. President, in regards to Gavin Newsom, would you be open to a congressional investigation in regards to the specific Palisades fire, where it killed 12 seniors, to see whether there's any negligence on Gavin Newsom or Karen Bass in regards to those deaths?\n\nPresident Donald Trump (18:31):\n\nWell, I tell you, there's negligence on not getting people permits. That is negligent. We got all of the federal permits, Lee Zeldin. The federal permits are much more difficult. They were all gotten within 30 days. People could go build the houses. It's going to be years before they are allowed to build the house.\n\n(18:46)And Karen Bass is grossly incompetent. And Newsom, this is a very incompetent guy. I watched him with the hands. I'm saying, what's going on with the hands? There's something wrong with him. You watch him. There's something wrong with this guy. But more importantly, he didn't allow the water to come from the Pacific Northwest.\n\n(19:07)They have tremendous amounts of water in California. People don't know. They send the water out to the Pacific Ocean. So I demanded it be open. If that were open during the fire, before the fire, you wouldn't have had the fire because all the sprinklers would've worked in the houses. They had no water. They had no water in the fire hydrants. You wouldn't have had the fire. It would've been put out after one house, two houses. But he stopped the water from coming in. And I had to send in the military to have that water opened after the fires. And now they have water. But he should have more because they've restricted. They still restrict it.\n\n(19:41)There's something wrong with these people. There's something really wrong.\n\n(19:44)As to investigation, I view it as a gross incompetence. I view it as an ideology that's wrong. It's a radical left ideology. And if I didn't win this election, I think our country would be destroyed. I don't believe you'd be here right now and our country would be destroyed. Yeah.\n\n(20:06)Go ahead, please.\n\nSpeaker 10 (20:07):\n\nPresident Trump, thank you, sir. What's the most important branches of interest between Poland and U.S. in your opinion?\n\nPresident Donald Trump (20:14):\n\nWell, it's just the relationship we have. I think there's a great trust and a great, more than most countries, more than almost any countries. We have some in a category that's very special and Poland is in that category. We have a very special relationship. It's like the question about the soldiers that was asked. We never even thought in terms of removing soldiers from Poland. We do think about it with regard to other countries, but we would never. No. We're with Poland all the way and we will help Poland protect itself.\n\n(20:46)Okay?\n\nPreseident Karol Nawrocki (20:48):\n\nI would like to add something. Yeah, of course, security is most important also for our relation. And I'm historian as you know, maybe, as the president knows.\n\nPresident Donald Trump (20:57):\n\nSure.\n\nPreseident Karol Nawrocki (20:58):\n\nI'm a historian. This is the first time in Polish history in 20th century and the 21st century that the Poles are happy that we have foreign soldiers in Poland. So the American soldiers are the part of our society nowadays. We have almost 10,000 soldiers, and this is the signal to all world and also to the Russian Federation that we are together. But we are not like the Poland \"free riders\" in Europe and in NATO, Mr. President Trump knows it, because our GDP for military service achieved 4.7. So we are probably the one NATO nation, which is on this level. And we will not stop. Me as the president of Poland, we are going to achieve 5% of GDP for military service. But with American soldiers on Polish soil, we solidified and we are secure [inaudible 00:21:58]\n\nPresident Donald Trump (22:00):\n\nJust about that, Poland was one of two nations that paid more than they were supposed to with NATO. I don't know if anyone knows that. But there were two nations. And Poland paid more than they were supposed to. They thought it was low. And by the way, since then, at my request, they've raised it from 2% to 5%. But Poland was one of two nations that paid more than they were supposed to, which was a very nice thing. Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 11 (22:23):\n\n[inaudible 00:22:24] that you were not invited to the parade in Beijing.\n\nPresident Donald Trump (22:29):\n\nNever even thought about it until just now.\n\nSpeaker 12 (22:31):\n\nPresident Nawrocki, what's your message for Pres-\n\nPresident Donald Trump (22:33):\n\nNever even thought. It wouldn't have been my place to be there.\n\nSpeaker 12 (22:35):\n\nPresident Nawrocki, what's your message for-\n\nSpeaker 5 (22:39):\n\nSir, will you visit a restaurant in D.C.? You haven't gone to a single-\n\nPresident Donald Trump (22:43):\n\nI might, sure.\n\nSpeaker 5 (22:43):\n\nYou haven't gone to one in either of your terms that wasn't [inaudible 00:22:47].\n\nSpeaker 13 (22:47):\n\nHow do you know?\n\nSpeaker 5 (22:47):\n\nBecause I and many other reporters [inaudible 00:22:47].\n\nPresident Donald Trump (22:47):\n\nDo you want me to prove you're wrong? Do you want me to prove you're wrong?\n\nSpeaker 5 (22:52):\n\nYes, please.\n\nPresident Donald Trump (22:52):\n\nBut I will. I think it's something we could consider doing. Love to do it. I love the White House food, but after a while I could see going to a nice restaurant. It's safe. If you would've said like the governor, Governor Moore wanted me to go and walk through Baltimore with him. And I said, I think I'm a brave guy, but there's no reason to be stupid. They have crime that's at levels that nobody's ever seen before in Baltimore. They've done a terrible job. We'd go into Baltimore straighten it out very quickly, too. You know why? They respect our soldiers. You see our soldiers. They respect our soldiers. We'd go there, too. But we're going to have people asking us to go. They're going to want to.\n\n(23:29)And I think the people of those places are, the politicians are not in tune with the people. The people in Chicago, the people in Baltimore, the people in all of the places we talk about, they want to see us there. And I think we're pretty much waiting till we get asked and properly. We're doing them a big service. Yeah, please.\n\nSpeaker 14 (23:48):\n\nYou talked about how historic these tariffs have been bringing in revenue.\n\nPresident Donald Trump (23:52):\n\nYeah.\n\nSpeaker 14 (23:53):\n\nAdditional revenue for our country. You've also mentioned before they could possibly replace federal income tax.\n\nPresident Donald Trump (23:59):\n\nPossibly.\n\nSpeaker 14 (23:59):\n\nDo\n\nReporter (24:00):\n\nYou think that's Sunday it's possible?\n\nPresident Donald Trump (24:01):\n\nIt used to be. So if you go back to 1913 is when they ended tariffs. We were the richest ever from 1850, it was all tariffs, we didn't have income taxes, from 1850 to 1913. In the 1887, this is about 1887, they had the Great National Tariff Act, and it was a group of people that got together because our country was so rich, they didn't know what to do with the money. We had so much money, they didn't know what to do. It was a group of very prominent people that were set up to hand out money to everybody because we were the richest we ever were, proportionately we were in 1887 around that time even in 1913. We ended them in 1913. How did that work out? And then we went to the income tax system, and then we had the depression.\n\n(24:57)And by the way, a lot of people try and say that, \"Oh, tariffs with the depression.\" No, they ended in 1913, and then we went to income tax. And then in 1929 you had the depression. They did try and bring it back in 1931, '32, but the depression had long started, and this poor beautiful nation was gone. It was gone. We suffered for 25 years, took 25, 30 years to really recover from the depression. And we don't ever want to see that happen again. The tariffs are vital to the success of this country. When I say I ended seven wars, at least half of those wars were ended because of the power of tariffs. I was able to say, \"Well, we're not doing any business with you, or if you go into war, we're putting a big tariff in you.\" And all of a sudden they announced that the war was settled. I settled seven different wars, one going 31 years.\n\n(25:49)Look at the Congo and Rwanda, look at that. 31 years, 10 million people dead. I got it settled. And a little bit of that one less than in some cases had to do with trade and had to do with tariffs. So tariffs are vital to our country. And just so you know, other countries use on them us, but I just use them a lot better. We're in a much better position. We have trillions of dollars coming into our country. If we didn't have tariffs, we would be a very poor nation, and we would be taken advantage of by every other nation in the world friend and foe. We're not going to let that happen. And we have a very, very big case in the Supreme Court. I can only say this, our country has a chance to be unbelievably rich again, but it can also be unbelievably poor again. If we don't win that case, our country is going to suffer so greatly, so greatly.\n\nReporter (26:46):\n\nWhat's the plan to fight it, sir?\n\nPresident Donald Trump (26:47):\n\nBut I think we're going to have a big victory. Even if you look at the people that brought the case, they're foreign oriented. Countries have taken advantage of the United States for so many years. And I started with China, last term I took in hundreds of billions of dollars in tariffs from China. But when COVID came, the last thing I was going to do is, we're going to tariff France and Italy and others, Spain when they were doing so badly. But now we made a deal with the European Union where they're paying us almost a trillion dollars, and they're happy to do it. You know what? They're happy, it's done. These deals are all done. I guess we'd have to unwind them. We've done deals with Japan, with South Korea. We've done deals with many countries and others to come. And if we didn't have the power, prestige, and dignity of tariffs… And I used them wisely, and people respect America again, and we've become a rich country again. The money coming in is incredible. And again, they use them on us. If we didn't have them, they would use them on us and we would have no way to fight them. We would be a third-world nation. So I think it's one of the most important cases I've ever seen go before the Supreme Court of the U.S.\n\nReporter (28:06):\n\nPresident [inaudible 00:28:06].\n\n(28:06)[inaudible 00:28:06] you gave Vladimir Putin a two-week deadline to agree to talks with Volodymyr Zelenskyy. That deadline is now nearly approached, Can you give us any indication of when you will make a decision?\n\nPresident Donald Trump (28:19):\n\nWell, I'm having a conversation with him very shortly and I'll know pretty much what we're going to be doing. We've taken very strong action as you know, and in other ways we've taken very strong action. But I'll be speaking to him over the next few days and we're going to see-\n\nReporter (28:31):\n\nWith whom, sir?\n\nPresident Donald Trump (28:32):\n\n… I'm going to know exactly what's happening.\n\nReporter (28:34):\n\nMr. President [inaudible 00:28:35]-\n\n(28:34)[inaudible 00:28:35] Zelenskyy.\n\nPresident Donald Trump (28:34):\n\nI'm not happy with all the people. You got 7,819 people killed last week. Russian soldiers and Ukraine soldiers, right? Not American soldiers, not soldiers from Poland, but they're human beings, they're souls. They have parents, they wave goodbye to their parents, and the parents never see them again. That's the end of them over a stupid war. And I want to see it stopped. Now, we have stopped the money. We sent weapons to NATO, they pay full price. Biden spent $350 billion, so stupidly. And it was one of the reasons that this whole thing happened.\n\n(29:15)A big reason this war happened was sitting right in these chairs, this one in particular. So I think we're going to have a good solution, but they're losing soldiers at levels that nobody has seen since the Second World War. This is the worst conflict, and it's just going on and on. One's defense, one's offense, the offense moves a little bit, just a little bit. You take a look, they move inches. They're dropping bombs and killing everybody, the whole thing is [inaudible 00:29:47]. Not since the Second World War has there been anything even close to this.\n\n(29:51)And again, they're not soldiers from my country, this is my country. But I have a power to end things, that's why I was able to end seven other wars. And do you that I thought of the seven, basically seven. Those were tough wars to end. Much tougher I thought, than the war with Ukraine and Russia. I thought that Ukraine and Russia, I have a very good relationship with President Putin. I thought that, that would be much easier. I thought that would be in the middle of the pack, maybe one of the easiest. Sometimes you never know with war. War is a very interesting thing, you never know with war. War is complex and dangerous, and what a mess, what a bloody mess. It's going to get done one way or the other, but they have to stop killing all of these souls. They're souls and we have to stop killing. Thank you very much.\n\nReporter (30:39):\n\n[inaudible 00:30:39].\n\nSpeaker 15 (30:39):\n\nThanks guys. Thank you, guys. Thank you. Let's go, let's go. [inaudible 00:30:46]. Thank you guys.\n\nReporter (30:41):\n\n[inaudible 00:30:47].",

    "transcript": "President Donald Trump (00:08):\n\nHello. Thank you very much. Are you all set? You all ready? Nice group, big group. But I want to thank you all for being here as we prepare to celebrate Labor Day when we honor the incredible hardworking men and women of our country, which is doing very well, I have to tell you. Every policy of the Trump administration is designed to lift up the American worker, promote great paying blue-collar jobs and to rebuild the industrial bedrock of our nation.\n\n(00:36)It's also obviously for great defense. We have the greatest military in the world. We built it largely in my first term. Some of it was stupidly given away to Afghanistan. For what reason, nobody could figure that one. But it was still a relatively small amount if you compare… The concept of what they did, however, is just incredible. But the country is doing well. We're respected all over the world like never before probably.\n\n(01:08)We went to NATO, as you know, and they went from 2% to 5% of GDP. Nobody expected that. And the difference is they didn't pay the two and they paid the five. And as you know, we are selling a tremendous amount of equipment to NATO. We're not spending any money. We're making money. But I don't want to talk about making. I want to talk about we're no longer involved with funding Ukraine, but we are involved with trying to stop the war and the killing in Ukraine.\n\n(01:39)So we're selling missiles and military equipment, millions and millions and ultimately billions of dollars to the NATO people where I'm very friendly and we have a great relationship, but that was an amazing trip. So they're funding the entire war. We're not funding anything. I think it's an important point to make because a lot of people don't understand that. And we will continue to do that, and we're trying to get as much as we can for them.\n\n(02:08)They want the American product. The American military product is by far the best in the world, and that's what they want to get. They have lots of options, but that's what they want to get. So the factories are doubling up and tripling up where they make the Patriots and other really, you could say, defense and offensive weapons.\n\n(02:29)The wages for blue-collar workers are now rising at the fastest rate in 60 years, which is so important to all of us around this table. The average American worker has already seen a $500 wage increase this year. And there's no inflation because there's been tremendous decreases, thanks to Doug and Chris and some of the people, the great job they've done with energy. Thank you very much. And Chris, thank you very much.\n\n(02:56)I see you're down close to $60 a barrel, and you'll be breaking that pretty soon and that has a huge impact. So groceries are down, energy is way down, energy is way down. It was $4 and $5 for a gallon of gas. Think of that for gasoline. And now it's probably 2.25. There are some places it's $2. It broke $2 at a couple of locations in the South. In places like California where they charge such high taxes it's higher, but it's still much lower than what it was a year ago.\n\n(03:33)So energy's way down. Groceries are way down, eggs are way down. Thank you very much, Madam Secretary. You've done a great job. Appreciate it. When we came in, the eggs were through the roof. They were four times higher than they've ever been. And my first question from you people, \"What are you going to do with eggs?\" I said, \"What's the problem with eggs?\" That was caused by Biden or whoever was operating. The autopen actually caused it, I guess because I don't think he knew too much about eggs.\n\n(04:03)Factories are booming compared to before I took office. Domestic auto production, it's going to be so thrilling in two years when you see the numbers because they're building plants all over the country. They're all coming in because of tariffs. They don't want to pay the tariffs. And if they build their plant here, they don't pay the tariffs. And they're pouring into our country. And you know about AI and you know about other, but the auto plants, the good old-fashioned stuff that I love, the auto plants are pouring into the United States of America.\n\n(04:37)They're coming from Mexico, they're coming from Canada, and they're coming from Europe, all over Europe, and it's been pretty amazing. So factories are booming, and when they actually open… Right now, they're booming in terms of construction. This is something given to me by Mark Zuckerberg, and you'll see this is AI now. These are. I never understood. I said, \"Well,\" because I built shopping centers, and for $50 million you can build a very nice shopping center.\n\n(05:06)So I never understood. When they said 50 billion for a plant, I said, \"What the hell kind of a plant is that?\" But when you look at this, you understand why it's 50 billion. So this is one he's building in Louisiana. That's Meta, Facebook as people understand it to be. But look at that. That's the size of Manhattan. So that superimposed over the island of Manhattan. It takes up a big part of Manhattan. I think they say 81% of Manhattan. So these are big things and they're going up. A lot of them are going up now. I don't know that big. Actually, Mark is building four of them and others are building similar places.\n\n(05:51)And when these things open up, I'll tell you what, our country, we're leading China now in AI, substantially leading China. And the reason is because we're letting them build their own electrical facilities. We would need double the energy. If you take all of the electricity that we produce right now in this country, you'd have to multiply it times two or maybe three times. So three times more than we have right now for everything to operate your toaster and everything else. Okay? Three times more.\n\n(06:21)And the way we are able to succeed because China goes out and builds these massive plants. So right now, building 58 coal, in this case, almost all coal-fired plants. And coal is back with this country too, by the way. There's a reason they use it because it's good. It works for them. And we call it clean coal. We don't call it coal. We call it clean, even very clean coal. But we have coal going up. We have nuclear going up. Nuclear is very much in vogue now. It's safe and inexpensive and great.\n\n(06:54)We don't allow windmills. We're not allowing any windmills to go up. Unless there's a legal situation where somebody committed to it a long time ago, we don't allow windmills. And we don't want the solar panels that I was speaking with the secretary about because they take up thousands of acres of our farmland. You see these big ugly patches of black plastic that comes from China. And I like solar in some ways, but for firing up your big plants, it doesn't work. It's very unstable, but it really takes up your farm. The farmers are saying they're building these massive blotches in the middle of the fields all over the country. It's so crazy. It's so crazy.\n\n(07:37)So we're not heavy into that at all. And windmills, we're just not going to allow them. They're ruining our country. They're ruining everyone. I hate to mention countries, but you look at the UK, what's happened at UK, energy costs have gone through the roof. It's because of wind. They want to do everything. Close up the northern parts of the country, they have oil. It's tremendous. And they close it up. I tell them, \"You're my friends, but man, you're going to have a bad awakening very soon. It's going to be very bad.\"\n\n(08:13)They're ugly, they don't work. They kill your birds. They're bad for the environment. And if you look at them from a house, your house is worth less than 50%. So I'm trying to have people learn about wind real fast and I think I've done a good job, but not good enough because some countries are still trying and they're destroying themselves. Those are countries that are really destroying themselves. I hope they get back to fossil fuel because right now, Chris, whether we like it or not, fossil fuel is the thing that works. And then you can add nuclear with it and other things, but fossil fuel is what works if we're going to fire up those big monster factories.\n\n(08:51)But if you look at comparing everything before I took office, domestic auto production is up 18,000 cars a month, and we haven't even started yet because a lot of these plants aren't built. It's up 18,000 because Ford, General Motors and a couple of others, Stellantis, they're taking their existing plants and as quickly as they can, they're adding onto them. So when their plants open, because they're building big, modern, beautiful auto plants.\n\n(09:22)But think of that, we're up 18,000 cars a month and essentially all they've done is try and utilize their space correctly as their big plants open up. I hope they remember that it was this way. I hope this table gets a lot of the credit for what's happening. It gets all of the credit, because this would've never happened. We were going out of business everywhere. We were losing. All the car plants were leaving this country. Now they're all coming back in. And they are coming from Canada and they are coming from Mexico, but they're coming from Germany, they're coming from all over the world.\n\n(09:56)Domestic steel production is up by 100,000 tons of steel a week. We have a 50% tariff on steel, aluminum and various other things. Copper just got brought into the picture, and that means people are going to want to make steel here. We just made a deal with US Steel. As you know, we have an outside company come in, spend $17 billion on building new plants, new everything. It's great. And it stays right here in America. So we're doing amazingly well on steel.\n\n(10:35)And domestic oil production is up by more than 300,000 barrels a day. That's a lot of barrels, and you're going to be talking about that in a second, I think, Chris and Doug. These two people have done a fantastic job, and we have the oil price down to about $62 a barrel. So just so you understand, because a lot of you like to talk about costs and prices, but I watch so much fake information. Product costs are down, energy is way down. Energy brings things down. With energy, that's what happened with Biden. He stopped our program and then he went back to it when he realized that it looked like you're going to be paying numbers that nobody's ever seen. You're going to pay $7 a gallon.\n\n(11:22)They were up to $7, $7.5. So then he immediately went back to the Trump plan that they terminated, but it was too late for them. It was too late. They blew it. They had a great thing going. I gave them something great and they blew it. Since the inauguration, we've created over half a million new private jobs. And if you notice, when the numbers come out, government jobs are going down and private jobs are coming up, and that's what really fuels the country.\n\n(11:50)It's easy to hire people and pay them for doing something that maybe is not very productive. But government jobs are down, actually substantially down, and private jobs are way up. And these are the jobs that make money and create a better life. Meanwhile, we've reduced the number of federal bureaucrats by 84,000. So we got rid of 84,000. And I think the job numbers you're going to see, the new job numbers are going to be through the roof because of all of the different businesses that are moving into our country.\n\n(12:22)And not just production businesses, autos and AI, but any business you can think of. In the world of furniture, as an example, North Carolina, I went there many times when I built a lot of hotels and things and I'd go to North Carolina, I'd buy the greatest… They were the greatest, most talented people. And then China came along and took all of those jobs away. If they would've tariffed them, China wouldn't have taken any of the jobs. But we had presidents that, honestly, and I like some of them, but they didn't know what the hell they were doing from a business standpoint, from running the country.\n\n(12:57)And North Carolina have the most talented woodworkers that you've ever seen. I'd be there and I'd watch them. I'd say, \"I'd like to have a rail on that chair, maybe can you fancy it up a little bit?\" \"How about this, sir?\" And they'd hand me a thing. It was like they were artists. They were unbelievable. And that business was stolen from us by others. Not only China, but by others. All of a sudden, you're ordering your furniture from China. It was not even close to being as good, but they couldn't compete with it.\n\n(13:29)If we would've said it costs 100% or 200% tariff, you wouldn't have lost one job. It's so sad. But we're going to rebuild North Carolina furniture and other places, South Carolina too, to a lesser extent. They make furniture. But furniture, we're going to put a very substantial tariff on. We've already announced it. It'll be done pretty quickly. And when that happens, everyone's going to start… I'll just tell you, North Carolina, go out and start getting the grandchildren and the children, start teaching them.\n\n(14:01)Because some of those incredible artists that I knew as young people, they're older people now, but they still have the talent and they have time left, but they're going to be teaching their sons and their daughters and their grandchildren, and it's going to be a beautiful thing to see. It's going to happen like magic. It's going to happen without question. It's not like, \"Gee, I hope it happens.\" It's going to happen.\n\n(14:24)The results of Ford that just announced it's going to create 4,000 new jobs, American jobs. Hyundai, 14,000 jobs. General Motors is moving production of the Chevy Blazer and Equinox from Mexico back to the United States where it belongs. Don't forget, we lost 55% of our auto production over the last 35 years. 55%. We were the auto capital of the world. There was nobody even thinking about challenging us. We lost 55% of it to Mexico, Canada, China, a lot to China and other countries.\n\n(15:02)And it's all coming back. We will be bigger. A couple of years, we'll be bigger than we ever were. We'll be more dominant. We'll be bigger. We make great product too. We're starting to make really great product. We're going to be bigger than we ever were. We're going to be at the level that it was when we were the only one that really, we sold to the world and we're going to be back selling to ourselves and other parts of the world. It's not going to be the same, but it's going to be equally as important as it was in the heyday 30 years ago.\n\n(15:31)But we lost more than 50% of the auto making capacity. In fact, the unions, the auto unions, as you know, the top guy didn't know me, didn't like me, and now he likes me. He says, \"Man, I can't believe what Trump has done.\" But the auto workers voted for me. They understood better than anybody else. The auto workers, the Teamsters voted for me. Teamsters are great. They all voted for me. No Republican has ever gotten the support of the Teamsters and the auto workers.\n\n(16:01)And now the head of the auto workers, it's so amazing. I watched them on television. They can't even believe what happened. And I told them all what was going to happen. We secured new market access for American agricultural exports all over the world. Our secretary is doing a great job. Thank you, Brooke. And we have negotiated historic trade deals with the United Kingdom, China, Indonesia, Vietnam, the Philippines, Japan, South Korea, who was here yesterday, and the European Union.\n\n(16:32)Foreign nations are now paying hundreds of billions of dollars straight into our Treasury and numbers that nobody's ever seen before. As you know, we made trade deals with a lot of countries and many of those countries, just to be able to sit at the table, are paying us hundreds of billions of dollars. We made trade deal with the European Union. They were rough on us for a long time, and now we have a very good deal. Made that with them. Trillions of dollars is coming into our country. Trillions. Far beyond billions. Trillions of dollars, wouldn't you say, Scott?\n\nScott (17:08):\n\nYes, sir.\n\nPresident Donald Trump (17:08):\n\nAnd in a short period of time. They have to buy $750 billion worth of our energy product. Energy is great. We have more than anybody else and we're using it. But the European Union is a done deal and Japan is done. And I heard there was a problem with South Korea, but we met yesterday and they're done. We didn't do anything. We just kept the same deal. He honored the deal. They wanted to see if… Well, I don't even want to say it, but they wanted to see if they could do something. But they honored the deal, which is nice.\n\n(17:38)And we cut the previous record-setting. Trade deficit I hear just came out. We cut it in half already. We've only been here really for a few months because it takes you a little while to fix up the Oval Office and do those things to prepare for the battle. So we've really only been here for a very short period of time. And we cut the trade deficit in half. Is that right? That's fantastic. I didn't even think we were going to do that.\n\n(18:10)And remember, these are things that are being built. These things, all these numbers up here, they're not open yet. When they open, you're going to see things happen in the United States that nobody's ever seen before, including our country in its heyday. And I had the greatest economy in the history of our country my first four years despite COVID, which was a very unfortunate situation for the whole world. We did a great job with it. Never got the credit for the job we did.\n\n(18:41)Operation Warp Speed, people say is that one of the greatest achievements ever in politics or in the military because it was almost a military procedure. But everybody, including Putin, said that Operation Warp Speed, what you did with that, nobody can believe it. And we did a great job, but it was a horrible pall over our country. We had a very dark cloud over the world. That was a very, very bad thing that came out of Wuhan, which I said it came out of Wuhan. That's where it came from. And China suffered greatly, but everybody did.\n\n(19:20)But we did a good job with that, as good as you can possibly do. And we came back, and now we're stronger than ever before. If I didn't win this election, this country was gone. I'm telling you, economically, it was gone. None of the things that we're talking about would've happened. And the whole world was robbing us blind. Friend and foe, they were stealing our jobs, our money, our factories. They were stealing everything. We would've been a shell. We would've been a bankrupt broken shell. And that's the way it is. But we're doing just the opposite, stronger than we've ever been.\n\n(19:56)Last month in a landmark achievement, I also proudly signed the largest working-class tax cuts in American history. So the bill, I'm not going to use the term Great Big, Beautiful. That was good for getting it approved, but it's not good for explaining to people what it's all about. It's a massive tax cut for the middle class. It's a massive tax cut for jobs. Think of it, no tax on tips, no tax on Social Security.\n\n(20:27)So seniors, I don't know how you can vote for anybody else, and just think of that. And no tax on overtime. So you work overtime, you don't have to pay tax on overtime. That's good. The Democrats don't know what they're going to do. So they have this soundbite. They have all these soundbites. They send it out. I don't know, some guy sends out a word and everybody uses it, including the fake news. Some of you are here right now, I'm looking at you.\n\n(20:55)And it's death. They use the word death. No, it's actually life. It's almost like a newborn life. It's not death. That's their soundbite. The bill is death. It's not. We strengthened Social Security, we strengthened Medicare, Medicaid. The job we've done on Social Security is… If the Democrats got in, Social Security is over because the country's going to fail. There won't be any Social Security. And I made that pledge to you. We're going to take care of Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, and we are doing that in spades because the country is becoming so successful again, and it hasn't been this successful.\n\n(21:36)I think in the end, it will never have been this successful. I don't think it'll even be close with what's happening. Every American is seeing a tax cut as a result of the bill. The average police officer will keep an extra $1,000 a year at least in overtime, and the average waiter or waitress will keep nearly $2,000 extra in the fact that they would've had to pay that kind of money on tips. And I never realized that the government was so strong on that, but waitresses, waiters would tell me that the government would go after them. It was horrible. That's how it all started with me.\n\n(22:16)It just was incredible. And the biggest thing was, again, the $4 trillion that they found. They said, \"Well, that was nice.\" They should've announced it. I could've told them that. And I don't know. It should be simple, but a lot of people didn't understand it. Actually, a lot of good people didn't understand it. But now they're saying Trump was right, they've never seen anything like this. And I don't know what it is, Scott, they didn't understand what we were trying to explain to them was going to happen.\n\n(22:45)Everybody's moving back to the United States because they don't want to pay a tax. If they don't, if they're not here, they have to pay a tax. And it didn't seem that complicated, but it's working at a level that nobody can imagine. This is working $ 4 trillion. That's a big number. It's a number that nobody ever heard of before. Four trillion is exciting, but that's nothing compared to what's happening because these places haven't even opened yet. Some of them haven't even started hiring yet. They're under construction.\n\n(23:17)So it's construction jobs, but it's not the big number. And the big numbers, when they open, they're going to be very successful. It's a revolution. We're also working on things to ensure that the awesome power of artificial intelligence is used to benefit all Americans, including American workers and also American children. In that spirit, our wonderful first lady has just announced a presidential AI challenge. It's going to be a very good challenge, I can tell you. She's put her heart into it, which will inspire the next generation to stay on the cutting edge of this vital technology.\n\n(23:56)This is the new internet, the new computer, the new television, the new everything all put together in one. This is why when I show you a picture like that, I show you this. This is a factory superimposed over the island of Manhattan. And you have many of them being built right now all over the country or soon to start, some of them. Some of them have started. This one has actually started. That's in the great state of Louisiana. But the first lady's working very hard on this and it's an important initiative. And Melania, when she puts her mind to it, nobody could do better. There's nobody. So every young person should go to AI.gov to learn more.AI.govto learn more. And you'll see it's a great challenge. I think it's going to be a very modern kind of a challenge. It involves AI, which is very exciting to people. So I want to thank her; raise a lot of money for children. We're putting America first and we're going to be putting the America worker first. And the Republican Party has picked up four million new people. Four million. The Democrats have lost two and a half million. Other than that, they're extremely happy.\n\n(25:14)No, they're very depressed. They're very depressed. And their new box that they've fallen into is crime. There was a consultant on one of the shows this morning I was watching. I thought he was very good. He's a Democrat consultant and he was screaming, \"No, no, don't let him do this to you. It's another trap. It's another trap.\" What he's talking about, men playing in women's sports. They said, \"That's an 80/20.\" No, it's a 97/3. It's 97/3. Transgender for everybody, they fought for it. They're still fighting for it.\n\n(25:52)I saw a guy today, a politician that you all know very well, fighting like hell for men playing in women's sports. \"You don't understand. They're human beings also.\" Well, I agree, they're human beings, but you can't have a seven-foot guy playing basketball with the women. Just one of those little problems in life. And we all have our place. That's okay. I've got my place too. But this guy's screaming, \"It's another trap.\" And this is the worst of all. He said, \"Because this is crime. Trump is saying he's against crime and they're for crime.\"\n\n(26:31)No. He's going… It was funny, \"No, it's a trap. Don't do it.\" And then I saw this poor stupid Chuck Schumer, the guy, he looks like he's aged 100 years. And I don't like getting into looks. Looks don't mean anything, right? When you're in politics, looks don't matter. I look at Pam, I would never say she's beautiful because that'd be the end of my political career. Lori, Secretary and… But I will tell you, this is the best of all. And they're going to fight me.\n\n(27:09)This slob of a governor you have in Illinois. This poor guy got thrown out of his business by his family. I know the family. I was partners with the family, nice family. I like the family, but he was no good. They threw him out. He's governor of Illinois and he goes, about Trump, \"We don't need his help.\" Chicago is the worst. These places are really bad. Crime in DC was the worst it ever was. They make up stories. Crime in DC was the worst ever in history. And now, over the last 13 days, we've worked so hard and we've taken so many. There are many left.\n\n(27:50)But we've taken so many criminals, over 1,000. I watched a man from Maryland who said to me, \"Sir, you're the greatest president. You're doing an unbelievable job. What a great job.\" Governor Moore, has anyone heard of him?\n\nAudience (28:06):\n\nMm-hmm.\n\nPresident Donald Trump (28:07):\n\nHe's another hopeful for president. I don't think so. But I met him and I didn't realize it was on camera. Did you see they caught him on camera? I was at a game, I don't know, the Army-Navy game or something. And I met him in a hallway. And as usual, you do your job very well. One of these great cameramen had it on tape. But I met this gentleman, I never met him before. \"Sir, you're doing a great job. You're doing an unbelievable job. Thank you very much.\"\n\n(28:34)But then he goes on television and says, \"Oh, Trump is a dictator. He's a dictator.\" And a lot of people have heard… So the line is that I'm a dictator, but I stop crime. So a lot of people say, \"If that's the case, I'd rather have a dictator.\" But I'm not a dictator. I just know how to stop crime. And you would think that Illinois, where they have such a problem with crime, such a bad governor, he should be calling me and he should be saying, \"Could you send over the troops, please? It's out of control.\"\n\nAudience (29:06):\n\nThat's right.\n\nPresident Donald Trump (29:07):\n\nIt's out of control. In New York, it's out of control. Not as bad as Illinois, by the way. Not even close. In California, you would've not had the Olympics had I not sent in the troops, sent in the National Guard. They did a fantastic job. We had the Olympics, we have the World Cup coming. I got them in my first term and I was really sad because I said, \" Oh, boy, I got them and I won't be president.\"\n\n(29:34)And little things happen. Thank you, God. Thank you. Little things happen. Think of it, you could ask Gianni. Gianni would tell you. He's the head of World Cup. He's a great guy too, great commissioner. But he's the head of the World Cup. He said, \"Trump is the only reason we're doing this.\" And the sad part is that I was not going to have it. Probably, I wouldn't have even been invited to the game depending on who's president. And I got that.\n\n(30:02)I did not get 250, okay? The 250th anniversary, I did not get. I'd like to claim it, if I might. But I didn't get that. Whether I was president or not, it was still 250. I'd like to take credit for it. What I will take credit for is we're going to have a better celebration under Trump than you would have had under some stiff. That I'll take care of. We're going to have a safer place, Christie, because of you and Tom Homan and everybody.\n\n(30:29)So we have 250 coming up. We have the World Cup coming up, which is like having 45 Super Bowls, and we have the Olympics coming up. So we're going to have a very exciting three and a half years remaining. It's going to be done properly. So I just want to tell you our country's in incredible shape, our military is strong and powerful and respected. We had some fantastic decisions from the Supreme Court that let us put the people into the military and other businesses that are best for the job as opposed to some woke reason that was killing our country.\n\n(31:10)That was very strong, very powerful. You can now go into a company based on your ability as opposed to being forced in based on some factor that cannot make our country great. That was a big decision. Very, very big decision. And we've had a lot of great decisions and we've all made some great decisions sitting around this table. I want to thank Scott, unbelievable what's happening financially with you and Howard. And Vice President's involved in everything, and he's been great. And Marco has been… Really, I think you're born for this job. I don't think you should ever run for another office.\n\n(31:50)I don't think you should really. You're so good at this. He is so good. And everybody likes him. Everybody likes him. But everybody, much more importantly than like, I think you would say is respect. They respect Marco. They respect all the people around the table.\n\n(32:04)So what I'd like to do is I'd like to go around the table. You seem to like it. Your audience seems to like it based on ratings. And I want to mention about crime because we have a young lady here, Iris of Epoch Times. You're Iris, aren't you?\n\nIris Tao (32:21):\n\nYes, I am.\n\nPresident Donald Trump (32:22):\n\nAnd I heard you were very savagely mugged in the city, and I'm not going to let that happen under this administration. That was last year.\n\nIris Tao (32:34):\n\nIt was two years.\n\nPresident Donald Trump (32:34):\n\nAnd would you like to mention what happened?\n\nIris Tao (32:36):\n\nOf course. So first of all, thank you Mr. President-\n\nPresident Donald Trump (32:38):\n\nYou want to listen to this?\n\nIris Tao (32:40):\n\n… for having me here to share my story to the room and to the broader public. My name is Iris Tao. I'm a White House correspondent for NTD, the sister media of The Epoch Times. So more than two years ago, it was a Saturday morning in broad daylight. I was on my way to work and a young man with a black ski mask\n\nIris Tao (33:00):\n\nPointed a gun at my face and threatened me to hand over my phone, my wallet, my laptop and everything else. And when I refused, he used the butt of his handgun to strike me across the face in the cheek or what some people call a pistol whip me before running away. And that has deeply traumatized myself and my family ever since. I've never dared to walk in the street of D.C. at night, ever. And my family was extremely worried. So Mr. President. Thank you so much for what you're doing right now because-\n\nPresident Donald Trump (33:33):\n\nYou're being honest.\n\nIris Tao (33:34):\n\nSuch incidents involved not just me, but also my family. If he had shot me, I could have died right there in the middle of nowhere without my families or my friends knowing at the age of back then, I think 23, just starting my career here in D.C. without even starting a family. But now I'm very blessed to have this opportunity to-\n\nPresident Donald Trump (33:54):\n\nSo you had a gun pointed at your head and you probably figured that he's going to pull the trigger because these are animals that don't know what the hell. They couldn't care less. The pulling the trigger to him is a very minor event and I'm sure he is done it before. So how did you, and you did refuse to give it, which would probably, maybe somebody would say that was not the right decision, right? But you refused. But I understand that. And then he hit you real hard.\n\nIris Tao (34:20):\n\nYes.\n\nPresident Donald Trump (34:20):\n\nIt's really amazing that you weren't shot though, isn't it?\n\nIris Tao (34:24):\n\nI'm very blessed and that's why having this opportunity to stand here, to share my story today, one, I'm very grateful for God for allowing me to still survive to this day, but also to Mr. President. Thank you for now making D.C. safer.\n\nPresident Donald Trump (34:37):\n\nThank you very much.\n\nIris Tao (34:39):\n\nFor us, for our families, for my parents, on my behalf of my parents, and now my baby on the way. Thank you so much.\n\nPresident Donald Trump (34:51):\n\nAnd there are other reporters and journalists and good people, and you don't have to say it, but that have also been attacked violently and not violently too, pretty badly. And I bet you see a big difference in the streets right now, and this is only 12 days, but people that tell me they're going out to dinner now, I told my friend, but I have a lot of friends that are going out to dinner all the time now in D.C. and they weren't doing it 12 days ago. They would never even think… One of my friends went out five times. It was four times the last time I'm told, now it's five times. He said, \"I love going out to dinner\" and restaurants are starting to open again. A lot of them closed. Nobody wanted to go into a restaurant, nobody wanted to get to a restaurant or even sit in the restaurant. But you see a big difference now, don't you?\n\nIris Tao (35:40):\n\nI do, I do pass by Union Station every day on my way home. And I do feel a lot safer seeing the trucks right outside, seeing the national guard troops members right outside. It does make me feel like I'm hopeful about D.C. again. And one day hopefully we can raise our family here.\n\nPresident Donald Trump (35:56):\n\nThank you very much. It's nice. And those are tough troops too. Those are not politically correct troops. We don't have politically correct anymore. We have tough guys, tough people, including some tough women. But we have tough people. And when you look at them, I'll tell you, they showed one scene where a bunch of Tren de Aragua guys or whatever, maybe MS-13. Maybe MS-DNC, okay? Because to me they're worse, I think they're worse. MSNBC maybe is worse than Tren de Aragua, real scum, real scum, real dishonest people. But anyway, but they went into this gang, I think it was Tren de Aragua, Venezuela. And they weren't nice to this group of people. The gang was calling them, sir, yes sir, yes sir. Get out of here. Get the hell out of here. You're no good. Get out of here. And yes sir, yes sir, yes. These are people that beat up people all day long and they're calling these soldiers.\n\n(37:03)That's what they are. They're real soldiers. There's no games. I said, \"You don't have to be politically correct.\" And the way they used to spit in the face of the soldiers where the soldiers standing like this, and you'd have some guy or some woman sometimes screaming at them from one inch away. They're standing there and they're told you cannot do anything. And they start spitting, actually spitting in their face. And I said, \"You spit, we hit.\" And they're totally authorized to do that, all of those things. But your story is great. And there are other stories here, but they don't have to tell them. But some people are ashamed to tell them they don't want to tell them. But it was like a jungle and it's not a jungle anymore. And it's going to get so good that this will be the safest capital there is.\n\n(37:52)It'll be one of the safest places in our nation anywhere. And right now it's one of the most unsafe places, but not now. 12 days ago, it was the most unsafe place in our nation. And they have to stop issuing false crime numbers because I mean, I heard the mayor and I liked the mayor. Fine, I don't care if I like her or not, if she did her job, I wish you were a horrible person who did her job, but she's probably nice, I guess I don't care. I want her to her a job. But they issue, false numbers, she said, \"Crime is down,\" before we got. Now they can say crime is down, crime is very much down. But what they did is they issue numbers. \"It's the best in 30 years.\" Not the best, it's the worst. It's the worst. It's much worse.\n\n(38:42)And they gave phony numbers and then they fired the man who didn't want to write the phony numbers. He got fired. And I guess that whole situation is under investigation because it's a very important thing, Pam. I mean, if they're going to give these phony numbers, it's a false feeling that you get crime, you have to do something about it. And you can't go around saying, \"Oh, Washington D.C. is safe,\" If it's not, it's going to be very safe very soon. It's very safe right now you're going to go out, have dinner, people are going out all over the place. I have people that work in government, strong, tough cookies, they can take care of themselves.\n\n(39:19)But it doesn't help to have big strong muscles. And I work out, if a guy's over there with a gun shooting you in your face, you can be the strongest guy in the world. Guy has a gun, shoots you in the face. It doesn't matter how much you've worked out, how many weights you've lifted, how hard you worked. And so we have the toughest guys and we have the best guys. And I'm willing to go to Chicago, which is in big trouble. But we have a governor that refuses to admit his problems, huge problems.\n\n(39:53)Baltimore, Wes Moore was telling me he wants, \"I want to walk with the president.\" Well, I said, \"I want to walk with you too someday, but first you got to clean up your crime because I'm not walking with you, I'm not walking in Baltimore right now, Baltimore is a hellhole.\" And this guy, I don't even think he knows it, he's another candidate for president. Between him and Newscom, you've got some real beauties, I'll tell you. But if we didn't go into Los Angeles, you wouldn't have the Olympics in my opinion. You wouldn't have the Olympics. We went in and the sheriff, the boss, said, \"Thank God they're here.\" You could see his tape. He said, \"We were not able to control what was happening.\" That was the sheriff. And he said it loud and clear, and they're suing us for going in and cleaning up crime.\n\n(40:40)And yet their own sheriff said, on the first or second night, he said, \"We could have never handled…\" That was going to be, you were not going to have the Olympics because or the World Cup because there wouldn't be anything left. They shouldn't have lost 25,000 houses. The water was turned off from the Pacific Northwest and I was after them and my first administration turned on the water, turn it on. Nobody could have believed this could have happened, but they had no water in the fire hydrants. They had no water in the sprinkler systems that people put up in their ceilings. There was no water. And yet we have tremendous amounts of water. They send it all into the Pacific Ocean trying to protect a certain little fish. It's not doing well. Because it doesn't do well without water either. And it shouldn't be a protected species. But I think that's actually just an excuse. I actually think, \"These people are sick. There's something wrong.\" So we said hundreds of millions of gallons of water a day into the Pacific Ocean, they turn a valve and the valve heads out and we turn the valve back. I actually had to do it using force. We turned the valve back and now they have water, but not as much as they should have because they should. And I'm telling Gavin Newscom by this conversation right now, \"Turn the rest of the water on, turn it on.\" So things are done that are so sad in this country. Lack of common sense. I like to say the Republican Party is the party with common sense. We're smart, we're sharp, we're this and that.\n\n(42:21)They're smart, but they're radical left people and they can't help it. They're very smart, but they're radical left and they're destroying our country, but they're not going to destroy it anymore. So we picked up millions of people in the Republican Party, they lost millions of people and I think we're going to do very well in the midterms. And I just want to say one other thing and that's medicine. The cost of medicine all over the world is much cheaper than the United States because for years the world pushed us around, including our friends. And you go to Germany, you go to England, you go to different places and you go to a store and it's sometimes 10% of what we pay in the United States because they said, \"Nope, we're not paying anymore. You charge the United States.\" This went on for 25, 30 years and I invoked favorite nations.\n\n(43:12)I said, \"I want to pay the same as they're paying.\" And Bobby Kennedy is doing a good job and Dr. Oz is doing a good job. And I asked them, I mean, other than the basics that they're doing on autism and another thing, which we got to solve that problem because it's crazy what's happening. It's out of hand. But this is their most important thing that can be done is favorite nations, Bobby. And we're not talking about a 25% cut or 50, we're talking about a 1500% cut because people go to Europe to buy drugs and they come back with drugs, prescription drugs, normal. I don't mean the bad, bad drugs, I mean prescription drugs because you can buy them for 10%, 15%, 20% or what?\n\n(43:57)So they're going to go up in price. And I told the countries, and I get along good with all of them. You could ask. I get along good with all of them, but I said, I told them, I said, \"You're going to go up a little bit because it's the world. It's the world.\" So more people in the world that we have, we're going to go down a lot and they're going to go up a little and it's called equalization. We're going to have equalization. So we pay the same price as the lowest drug sold anywhere in the world. I think Bobby, that's going to happen pretty soon. The companies are ready for it. They had to go, for years, I was with a very great gentleman from Eli Lilly, I think he's an incredible executive.\n\n(44:40)I'll mention the company and I'll mention him because we had this argument my first term and then we had it in my second term. And my second term. I wouldn't stop until I won the point. And he threw up his hands. He says, \"You're right. I can no longer defend it. I can no longer defend that a pill that's made by Johnson & Johnson in a factory, in the same factory in the United States versus a place in Europe or other places, including Canada,\" by the way. You could buy it for 10% or 15% or 20% the cost of what we're paying, where we'd pay five, six, seven times more money.\n\n(45:21)He said, \"It's the hardest part of my job defending that I'm not going to do it anymore.\" I'm saying that we have to get down to business. And that's a great company. He's done a great job and I appreciated it. And it really broke the ice because they were sending, well, we have to do research and development. Well, you have to do it for Germany and all these other countries too. Well, they think the United States should bear it. I mean, I heard this stuff for, and I finally said, \"It's over, now, you have to have somebody that can get these countries to do it.\" I told them, \"If you don't do it, we're going to charge you a 25% tariff on everything you send into our country. That's much more money than what we're talking about. Then we have to get the drug companies to do it and they'll do it because we have tremendous power over the drug companies too.\"\n\n(46:03)So we're going to get it done. I just hope we get it done fast, Bobby, because this thing should go fast, but we're going to get, the cost of medicine is going to be 1000%. Think of that, not 2%. And I just tell this last story. When I was in my first term, in my last year, I was so proud of myself because drug prices went down for the first time in 28 years under my administration. You know how much it went down one quarter of 1%. And I was so proud of that and I held a news conference. I think you'll be able to find it. Congratulated myself and my administration because for the first time in 28 years, drug prices went down one quarter of 1%. That is tiny, but it still went down and I thought it was great. And then I realized it's a very complicated business and formula.\n\n(47:01)You got to be very smart. I said, \"We're really getting ripped off by the whole world. The whole world is ripping us off.\" And what happened is I got on this kick and I got the drug companies to agree, and I got countries to agree, countries to agree, and they're not agreeing because they think I'm a nice person. They're agreeing because I will put charges and costs and tariffs onto them that will be many times more than what they're going to be paying. So the companies are there and the countries are there and we got to get it done, Bobby. We got to get it done and we're going to have the biggest price of, now that's going to lower Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid. This is going to lower everything because drugs go for everything.\n\n(47:53)It's going to have the biggest impact I think, of anything that can possibly be done, but your costs are going to be going down for medicine, for prescription drugs will be going down at levels that nobody ever thought possible, and that's going to happen in a matter of a very short period of time.\n\nSpeaker 1 (48:10):\n\nVery short.\n\nPresident Donald Trump (48:10):\n\nAnd we're all set with the countries and we're all set with the companies. It's all, you need the two and the middle man gets cut out. Under this scenario the middle man doesn't exist anymore. That was the other thing they always blamed the middle man, they said, \"Ooh the middle man,\" nobody knew who the middle man was.\n\nSpeaker 1 (48:27):\n\nThat's right.\n\nPresident Donald Trump (48:27):\n\nThey ad the most complex formula. It was genius, but they didn't get away with it. So I'm counting on Bobby, do you want to start, Bobby? Maybe we'll start with you. You can start with that and then go on to what we're talking about.\n\nBobby (48:41):\n\nWe are deep into MFN negotiations, most-favored-nation status. Negotiations with 14 companies. Howard Lutnick is a breath of fresh air, and I think he's going to help us get across the finish line with the leverage that we have from there.\n\nPresident Donald Trump (49:04):\n\nThey're smart, don't let them get away with it, Howard.\n\nHoward Lutnick (49:08):\n\nWell, the combination of Bobby's MFN and the 32 pharmaceuticals, which we launched together, when you put those two together, it really gives Bobby the tools to go execute your plan. So I'm supporting Bobby as he executes his plan.\n\nPresident Donald Trump (49:24):\n\nGood, right.\n\nBobby (49:25):\n\nYes, and we were… This Cabinet meeting is supposed to be about working Americans and bringing jobs back to this country and particularly rural America. And I want to mention the Big Beautiful Bill, right now we spend 7% of Medicaid dollars on rural hospitals, so they're getting the short end of the stick. It's about $19 billion a year under the Rural Transformation Program we give them an extra 10 billion a year. So we're raising an infusion of cash of rural hospitals and rural communities by 50%. It's going to be the biggest infusion in the history and it's going to restore and revitalize these communities. And we can't survive as a nation if we don't honor our rural communities, which there a source of our values, our virtues, our character, our economy, our food, and you are bringing that back. You are bringing those communities back. I wanted to talk because you mentioned the wind farms. We now have an interdepartmental coalition, a team which is Doug Burgum and Howard Lutnick and Chris Wright and Pete Hexeth. We're all working on this issue.\n\nSpeaker 2 (50:41):\n\nAnd Lee.\n\nBobby (50:41):\n\nAnd Lee, sorry, Lee. We're all working together on this issue. We're meeting together, are right now 11 wind farms planned that were launched during the Biden administration between Maine and Virginia. It's 1,130 towers. These towers are twice the size of the Washington Monument. The blades on them are-\n\nPresident Donald Trump (51:04):\n\nAre massive. It's so crazy.\n\nBobby (51:06):\n\nThe blades are 350 feet long, one blade. One of these blades blew up on Nantucket last summer and the water was filled with shards of glass of sharp glass, so it was dangerous to swim. They had to close the beaches, but they haven't identified themselves to the local community scans them. None of these projects are bonded. If you build an oil derrick in the Gulf, you got to put a bond down. There's no bond for dismantling them, and that's one of the tools that Doug is now using to challenge some of these projects. The cause of energy from these projects is 39 cents a kilowatt-hour. The average cost in this country is 17 cents per kilowatt-hour.\n\nPresident Donald Trump (51:51):\n\nAnd natural gas is 3 cents.\n\nBobby (51:54):\n\nRight. So it is the most expensive energy. I've been representing commercial fishermen for 40 years. They are so excited about what you're doing. Mr. President, because their fisheries are being wiped out. As soon as they begin construction the groundfish fisheries just disappear. The fish leave the area. They've killed 160 whales in the last two years. They're wiping out the whale population, the Atlantic whale population, the big whales, the Monkees, the gray whale or the humpback whales, the right whales, and you are going to save the whales on the East Coast because of this, and you're going to save these economies. They're based upon commercial fishing. I'll say one other thing about fishing. The South Asian nations are now dumping shrimp on our country. The shrimp is heavily contaminated. We just stopped a shipment that was contaminated with cesium-137, which is radioactive. They're farming these shrimps and they use bactericides and antibiotics and all kinds of chemicals, and the shrimp are so contaminated that the European nations won't take them. So they're dumping them all here and they're putting out a business.\n\n(53:07)We have the most sustainable, highly regulated fishery in the world. What our fishermen do is a good thing. And all of the trawlers in the Gulf and Alaska are being shut down because we're getting shrimp dumped here. So we have now increased FDA inspections of shrimp to make sure that Americans are not buying and eating contaminated shrimp and putting our shrimpers out of business. I talked just about, very briefly, we have an historic agreement on pre-authorization. We brought together 80% of the insurance industry, which is agreed to, for 80% of diseases and injuries to give immediate pre-authorization so that when you go to your doctor's office and he prescribes you a new knee or whatever it is, you will immediately know whether your insurance company's going to pay for it. This is an historic agreement.\n\n(54:01)People have been trying to do it for decades, and we, because of your leadership, brought the insurance industry together and got them to voluntarily agree to do this. Similarly, we made another historic agreement with personal health records. Of the 60 biggest tech companies in our country have all agreed to allow Americans for the first time access to their personal data, which they own, which these companies have been monetizing without permission. You're going to be able to see by next year all of your health records on your cell phone. It's going to save lives. It is going to fuel an infusion of technology into that space where people can access those records. They can compare their diet to what they personally need, and we'll have personalized medicine. We are doing price transparency. You passed this during your first term and then the Biden administration refused to enforce it.\n\n(54:59)We've now brought an HHS under your leadership and my leadership, more enforcement actions than during the entire four years, the Biden administration. So we're going to have that kind of price transparency. I'm working with Linda on forcing medical schools and the MCATs, the people who administer the MCATs, the people who do accreditation to put nutrition into medical school education. Right now, 25% of the doctors in this country do not feel competent to give nutritional advice. 70% of diabetes cases can be reversed or ended if you just change people's diets and the doctors don't know how to advise it. They only know how to prescribe the drugs. We are going to change that. So if you come out of a medical school under the Trump administration, you are going to know about diet. And then finally, most importantly, the Pete and Bobby challenge.\n\n(55:58)I want to give an update, Pete or I got five minutes of 48. It's 100 push-ups, 50 pull-ups and you try to do it within 10 minutes. I got five minutes and 48 seconds, Pete beat me. I'm still bitter at that. Five minutes, 25. The cabinet leader is Scott Turner, despite [inaudible 00:56:19] he's got five minutes and 15 seconds. I'm waiting for reports from the rest of the cabinet. The only exemptions currently existing as if you can hit a 50 at Bedminster, which President Trump did with Bryson DeChambeau. So he's the only one exempt in this room and everybody else.\n\nPresident Donald Trump (56:45):\n\nThat's great, Bobby. Bobby, autism, if I could just, I don't want to go too long because we have a lot of people, but the autism is such a tremendous horror show, what's happening in our country and some other countries, but mostly our country. How are you doing on that?\n\nBobby (57:00):\n\nWe are doing very well. We will have announcements as promised in September. We're finding interventions, certain interventions now that are clearly almost certainly causing autism, and we're going to be able to address those in September.\n\nPresident Donald Trump (57:17):\n\nIt's such a big day. I'm looking forward to that day because there's something wrong when you see the kind of numbers that you have today versus 20 years ago and those numbers, what are those numbers, Bobby?\n\nBobby (57:30):\n\nIn 1970, the biggest epidemiological study in history was done in Wisconsin. They looked at 900,000 children and they were looking for autism. They knew what it looked like and they were very, very precise about it and they found an incident rate of 0.7. In other words, less than one for every 10,000 children. Today, our most recent numbers are one in every 31 kids. It's probably actually much worse than that because California, which has the best collection system, is reporting one out of every 19 children, American children as autism, one in every 12.5 boys. So it's gone from less than one in 10,000 in 1970, to one in every 12.5 boys-\n\nPresident Donald Trump (58:20):\n\nThose numbers. So there has to be something artificially causing this meaning a drug or something. And I know you're looking very strongly at different things, and I hope you can come out with that as soon as possible.\n\nBobby (58:33):\n\nWe will.\n\nPresident Donald Trump (58:34):\n\nSo one in 10,000 and now it's one in 31 or 34 or 12 if it's a boy, can you imagine that one in 12, that's for a boy.\n\nBobby (58:45):\n\nOn average, 12.5 boys.\n\nPresident Donald Trump (58:46):\n\nIt's not even believable that that could be. And that was one in 10,000 not so long ago. I've been hearing these numbers and they get worse and worse every year. There's got to be something. I think there's nothing including favored nations and everything else. There's nothing that can be, if you can find out the reason that that's happening, and I know we're going to do some things, I think it's-\n\nBobby (59:12):\n\nWe will have that answer for you.\n\nPresident Donald Trump (59:14):\n\nI think we maybe know the reason. And I look forward to that press conference to be with you in that press conference. That's going to be a great thing. Thank you, Bobby, you're doing a great job. Linda, how about it? And we want nothing less than $500 million from Harvard. Don't negotiate, Linda. They've been very bad. Don't negotiate. Go ahead.\n\nLinda (59:35):\n\nAll of that's working. Well, Mr. President, thank you very much. Since we are focusing today on a Labor Day, and I know Kelly and Lori are both going to echo some of the things that I'll say as well. We are really focusing in our workforce, but what I'm finding with great joy around the country is that states really are being innovative and working more with middle schools and with high schools to make sure that we are having hands-on learning. There are pathways to jobs that are happening now, and if we see more and more of our community colleges working with our middle schools and our high schools, so that high school students are graduating not only with a diploma, but a certificate that they have worked with, perhaps with a Toyota or another company that is coming in public-private partnerships and they're learning on the job so that when they graduate from high school, they're ready to go into the workforce.\n\n(01:00:32)Because we know with all of these wonderful jobs that are coming back into the country through AI, through just our normal jobs that we need electricians, HVAC operators, et cetera, if we don't have this training, we're not going to have the workforce we need for all these wonderful jobs. So governors are really excited about this prospect. I've been now to several states and visited community colleges and tech schools with governors, and they're just all on board for getting this done. I think it's one of the best things that we're hearing relative to the job market. So we're just kind of focusing on that for today.\n\nPresident Donald Trump (01:01:07):\n\nSo we're bringing education back to the states. To put it in a more simple fashion, we're going to let the states educate our children again. And we're rated out of 40 countries we're 38, 39 or 40. So obviously it's not working what they've been doing for the last 30, 40 years. And if you go back, the best are like Norway, Denmark, Sweden, some of the other, Finland. They're very highly rated. If you go back to just take a look at anything you want to do, you just look at us, in the past. If we gave Iowa or gave Indiana or gave, and I don't say every one of them, a guy like Gavin Newscom is not going to do well. Certain states won't do well, but even California, you cut it up into sections. You have Riverside, you have this, you have that. You cut it into five sections, and if you had a good governor, you'd be able to do well. But certain states will be able to compete with Denmark, Norway, Sweden, and everyone. It'll be just as good. So I figure you have close to 40 of those states.\n\n(01:02:23)And then you'll have 10, you'll have five that won't be very good. You'll have five disasters and we'll have to work on those disasters. But for the most part, we will have education that will go zooming up in those charts just like we have in everything else we've done. And I think it's one of the most important things we're doing at this table. So bringing education back to the states where you have the parents running it, where you have the school boards that are local. We have people running from Washington that have never even been to the state that they're in charge of. They've never even been there, and I don't think they care about it. So we want to close up the Washington buildings, sell the buildings off, let somebody else get rich with the real estate because it will be a crime-free city. By the way, speaking of that, anybody murders something in the capitol, capital punishment. Capitol, capital punishment. If somebody kills somebody in the Capitol, Washington, D.C. we're going to be seeking the death penalty.\n\n(01:03:27)And that's a very strong preventative. And everybody that's heard it agrees with it. I don't know if we're ready for it in this country, but we have it, we have no choice. So in D.C. and Washington, states are going to have to make their own decision. But if somebody kills somebody like you could have been killed, very lucky you didn't get killed, it's the death penalty. Okay? Fantastic job you're doing. Thank you, Linda, very much. How are you doing with the colleges, by the way? You're doing some pretty good work in terms of getting them to treat people fairly.\n\nLinda (01:04:09):\n\nWell, interestingly enough, since we've been negotiating with some of the Ivy League schools, I have presidents of universities calling every single week. They want to sit down and talk to us about all of the steps that they are taking because they would like to not come under the same investigative program and so it is having its desired effect.\n\nPresident Donald Trump (01:04:28):\n\nThat's great.\n\nLinda (01:04:29):\n\nThank you. Fire a shot across the bound, the big guys. People kind of step in line and know you mean business, and we have teeth in these agreements, and I'm proud of the work that we're doing there.\n\nPresident Donald Trump (01:04:38):\n\nWell, they misbehaved and some of these schools are getting billions and billions of dollars and they misbehave. So that's it. And so one way or the other, we're going to win that whole thing. We're going to straighten them out, okay? Thank you. Great job. Lee, please.\n\nLee (01:04:56):\n\nMr. President, the Trump EPA has a special Labor Day message to America's workforce, especially our autoworkers, our coal miners, our steam fitters, our pipe fitters, and the list goes on. See what a difference a year makes. A year ago, the way that the Environmental Protection Agency was operating, the choice was made to protect the environment we would have to strangulate the economy. That's the way that the EPA operated for years. There is a binary choice. We had to choose one or the other. The Trump EPA completely rejects that. See, we choose to protect the environment and grow the economy. And a very special shout out to Russ Vought and his team at the Office of Management and Budget. We give him a lot of work. He's happy to do it. Dozens of different deregulatory actions. We just announced a proposed rescission of the 2009 Obama EPA Endangerment Finding all of the light, medium,\n\nLee (01:06:00):\n\nMedium and heavy-duty vehicle regulations that followed. It is the single largest deregulatory action in the history of the United States government. And when you add up the dozens of different actions that we have announced and that we're working through in one agency in one year, we'll do more deregulation than entire federal governments have done across all agencies, across entire presidencies. And what we are accomplishing would not be possible if not for the support of the rest of this team you've assembled around this table. The well-oiled, well-wired machine at the White House led by Susie Wiles and the DCOSP, the Policy Shop led by Stephen Miller. They have been amazing to work with. I was just in Iowa with Administrator Loeffler, made announcement with Secretary Rollins to reverse the deratement on diesel exhaust fluid systems. Mr. President, you said you wanted water flowing faster. Working with the Secretary of Energy, we've done our part to do that, to get gas cans flowing faster, to stop that annoying start-stop feature in vehicles.\n\n(01:07:12)See, people out there might say, \"Well, why are you focused on all of these little things?\" If it's little to you, it doesn't mean that it's not a very big deal for millions of other Americans. The charge was clear when you called me in November and you asked me to do this job, clean air, land and water for all Americans, unleash energy dominance, advanced cooperative federalism, permitting reform, make America the AI capital of the world, bring back American auto jobs. What we are accomplishing now, again, wouldn't be possible if not for your leadership. I'm grateful to the American people for electing you and our amazing vice president. I was just in Mexico City announcing and signing, on behalf of the Trump administration, an agreement with Mexico for a permanent solution for the Tijuana River sewage crisis, which you have been so outspoken and passionate about in our conversations. It would not be possible if not for Secretary Rubio, deputy Secretary Landau, U.S Ambassador to Mexico Johnson. The team at the State Department has been incredible.\n\n(01:08:20)The work with the NEDC on permitting, to be able to get new pipelines built, to get new factories started. And the list, it's amazing. Somebody out there might not realize the relationship between the Environmental Protection Agency and the Department of Defense. The amount of work with Secretary Hegseth and the Army Corps, from responding to the LA wildfires to getting more water flowing in California, which is also something that Secretary Burgum is involved with, to helping the farmers, the ranchers and landowners to revise the waters of the United States definition so they don't have to go hire an attorney or a consultant to tell them whether or not a water on their property is subject to federal regulation. Thank you for putting this entire team together. It's an honor to be at the Trump EPA where we choose to both protect the environment and grow the economy. It's a very happy labor day for America's workforce.\n\nPresident Donald Trump (01:09:15):\n\nAnd Lee, in Los Angeles, if you could, because of the fires, Lee was there, and as you know, we have very strict federal rules having to do with the rebuilding of those houses, and Lee was able to get the approvals done for everybody immediately. It was so fast, nobody could believe it. And the mayor and the governor still haven't gotten them their approvals and they're going to have riots out there for that reason. These are great homeowners. They want to build a house. They can't get approved because you have the mayor, Bass, who has no idea what she's doing, and you have a governor who is just such a bad governor, and the people are unable to build their house. The toughest permit to get was the federal permit by far, and yet he got them all in a short period of time after the fire. How long did it take?\n\nLee (01:10:05):\n\nWell, Mr. President, you came in, signed an executive order and told the EPA that we had less than 30 days to complete our hazardous material removal, which the initial response, once all of our heart rates went down a bit, was just to figure out how to get it done. We got it done in just less than 30 days. The Army Corps of Engineers then comes in for the debris removal. The federal government in clearing over 13,000 properties that were destroyed because of these wildfires. We've gotten to the point today where property owners all across Los Angeles, they're grateful to the Trump administration, they're happy that we did our part, but they are desperate to rebuild and there is not a single green light approval that they are waiting for from the Environmental Protection Agency, the EPA and the Army Corps of Engineers proudly have done our work. It's important for those local officials to let these property owners build on their land. It's their property. It doesn't belong to the mayor of Los Angeles. And they need to represent their people better. They're ready to build.\n\nPresident Donald Trump (01:11:14):\n\nWhen will they have their permits from Los Angeles?\n\nLee (01:11:16):\n\nWell, here's the problem, Mr. President, is that they have been ready since the moment we were done with the federal part. I was visiting a week after. Actually, I thought my first trip was going to be to Los Angeles. However, the moment I got confirmed, the vice president said, \"You're going to East Palestine right away.\" So that actually ended up being the first visit because the vice president's so passionate about that from the great state of Ohio. Then we went to Los Angeles from there. We're talking about the beginning of February where we were meeting with property owners already… They were already all set up. They had the contractors. It was the beginning of February and they were waiting for green lights from Los Angeles to be able to go onto their property and start rebuilding. Some of the same people who were waiting for a green light ready with the contractors at the beginning of February are still waiting now in the middle of August. Let these Californians rebuild.\n\nPresident Donald Trump (01:12:14):\n\nTalking about also taking away some of the properties and building low-income housing on those properties. They're going to have problems like they've never had before. These people don't know what they're doing. So we have all our permit… Everything the federal government has to do was done long ago. They should have been… I went to a town hall with Lee, but we were there and the mayor was saying it would take two years, maybe three years to get this approved. I said, \"No, no, not two years, two days. They should have it in two days.\" And I toured the site and I met a hundred homeowners all standing in front of this site a couple of days after the fire and they were ready to go right then and they wanted to just build right then, and the city won't let them do it. I don't think it's that they won't. I think they're incompetent, okay, to be honest with you. I think they just don't know how to go about it.\n\n(01:13:08)It is so badly run by [inaudible 01:13:10] and by Mayor Bass. Mayor Bass, she was in Africa during the fire. She knew the fire was starting to rage and she decided to take a trip to Africa. These people, they're just bad. You talk about make America great again, they can never make America great again, but we are doing that. Congratulations, you found some interesting things, Tulsi. She's becoming a bigger and bigger star every day. She found a lot of good things. Go ahead.\n\nTulsi (01:13:39):\n\nThank you, sir. As we approach Labor Day weekend here, this is just such a great opportunity really to recognize your leadership as a true champion for working people. And I know we'll hear, as we go around the table here, how your focus singularly on putting the wellbeing and interests of the American people first is that common thread that we're seeing in your policies being implemented across your administration. For ODNI, number one, our focus is and must always be making sure that our intelligence community is focused on our mission, keeping the American people safe, secure, and free. We're doing great work on this front. I'll point out our National Counterterrorism Center led by director Joe Kent, our working across different agencies with Homeland Security, DEA, FBI, and others to catch terrorists, both those who are trying to come into our country, those who may already be in our country, they are finding the worst of the cartel bosses and making sure that they're not able to continue to wreak havoc and terror in our communities.\n\n(01:14:44)Secondly, Mr. President, you have charged me with the mission of finding the truth and telling the truth to the American people and we've exposed some of the worst examples of the weaponization of intelligence in the last several weeks. I will continue down that mission and that path, wherever it leads. Transparency, telling the truth is what will drive true accountability for the American people who deserve nothing less. And lastly, Mr. President, all of us are charged with being good stewards of taxpayer dollars. I've gone through a reorganization for ODNI that we've announced in the last week. We've cut nearly half of redundant, unnecessary functions within ODNI, saving taxpayers over $700 million a year. We will continue focusing on our core mission in keeping the American people safe and appreciate your leadership and your focus on this most critical task.\n\nPresident Donald Trump (01:15:41):\n\nAnd you've also found many bags of information. I think they call them burn bags. They're supposed to be burned and they didn't get burned, having to do with how corrupt the 2020 election was. When will that all come out?\n\nTulsi (01:15:57):\n\nMr. President, I'll be the first to brief you once we have that information collected. But you're right, we are finding documents literally tucked away in the back of safes and random offices in these bags and in other areas, which again speaks to the intent of those who are trying to hide the truth from the American people and trying to cover up the politicization that was led by people like John Brennan and James Clapper and others that have caused really immeasurable harm to the American people and to our country.\n\nPresident Donald Trump (01:16:29):\n\nGreat job. Thank you. We look forward to hearing it. The public looks forward. Thank you very much. Administrator.\n\nSpeaker 3 (01:16:36):\n\nThank you, Mr. President. Well, everyone knows there's no stronger advocate for hardworking American families than you. Sarah, thank you for the largest tax cut in American history. For working families, the average family of four is going to save about $10,000, take home pay more a year. And what we're seeing is an increase in the child tax credit, the increase in the standard deduction. Hardworking families are going to benefit from this bill, and small businesses. There's no bigger beneficiary than Main Street because small business makes up 99% of all businesses in this country. I've traveled to nearly half of our states, 24 unique states. I've made 40 state visits. In fact, I was with our great vice president at a small business manufacturer in Georgia last week. I was with a trucking company in Ohio. I was in Michigan at a motorcycle manufacturer. The return of Made in America is going to be driven by small businesses because 98% of all of our manufacturers in America are small and medium businesses, 600,000 factories that employ 5 million people.\n\n(01:17:43)And as secretary McMahon mentioned, this work-based learning that is going on in professional and trade schools is real. I visited them from Utah to Maine to Georgia and seen this revolution in education happening. So small businesses need skilled labor. Now that you solve for inflation, for the taxes… Every Democrat voted for a $4 trillion tax increase on the backs of hardworking Americans, and so you prevented that, and now we've got fair trade. And thanks to Administrator Zeldin, we're seeing deregulation. I mean, this diesel exhaust fluid crushed farmers and construction and other heavy industry, so rolling that back makes a real difference for small business. And your domestic economic agenda is amplified through small businesses, which is why small business optimism is above its 53 year average finally. And so Main Street appreciates it. What Main Street wants now is a rate cut. They feel burdened by high interest rates. They would grow higher and expand more if they could, but the interest rates are really hurting them.\n\n(01:18:51)And finally, I want to say thank you for your executive order on debanking. We're about to announce a major investigation on debanking. It happened to you and your family. It happened to me. It happened to thousands and thousands of Americans, and unfortunately disproportionately on those that had conservative values, on Christians, on pro-life, on 2A businesses. And so we're going to be talking to the banks about that. The SBA operates the largest government business loan program in the federal government. We have a network of 5,000 banks, so we're going to be making sure that that never happens to anyone again.\n\nPresident Donald Trump (01:19:29):\n\nGood job. You're doing a great job. Thank you very much. Kristi.\n\nKristi Noem (01:19:33):\n\nMr. President, first of all, thank you for the opportunity to work for you. You committed when you ran for president to make America safe again, and today the average family and individual that lives in this country is safer than they've been in years because of what you've done. We've got three months in a row now with zero illegal aliens coming into this country and I want to thank Pete and the Department of Defense for all of their help. They're down at the border with us still helping us keep that border secure and make sure we know who's coming into this country. You've arrested and brought to justice hundreds of thousands of illegal aliens, criminals that have perpetuated violence against American people. Sir, you've had 1.6 million people voluntarily go home to their home countries that were here in this country illegally. Because of your strong message and you enforcing the law, they decided to go home on their own so that they could come back the right way someday and be American citizens.\n\n(01:20:30)But what I think is one of the most remarkable statistics is that under Joe Biden's administration, 88% of new jobs went to foreign born individuals. Under your administration, 2.5 Americans have jobs today that they didn't under the previous administration, and they have those jobs because you created opportunities. You made this country safe, you opened up the economy, you enforced the law. Now people can get up and provide for their families and go to work every day and be confident in that. And the last thing I would say is that it's incredibly important to know that every one of those illegal aliens that has gone home, they were costing us about 8,700 to $9,000 apiece in what they were taking out of our social programs, out of social security. You've saved this country billions of dollars, about $15 billion just in what those illegal aliens were costing us in social programs.\n\n(01:21:32)I've cut over 450 different contracts at the Department of Homeland Security. We're getting rid of corrupt ones, ones that were not efficient for taxpayers, who weren't focused on our mission of keeping us safe. And we've also renegotiated and brought in our biggest vendors and said you have to do better, and we've saved the taxpayers over 13 billion dollars doing that as well. So we're continuing to be accountable with taxpayer dollars but Sir, focused on doing the mission of what you've committed and that's to keep us safe and to make sure we put Americans first.\n\nPresident Donald Trump (01:22:03):\n\nGreat job and great job at the border. We had millions and millions of people coming in. To think three months in a row, zero.\n\nKristi Noem (01:22:11):\n\nIncredible.\n\nPresident Donald Trump (01:22:12):\n\nThat's some job. Thank Tom and everybody. And Pete, good job. Not surprised. Thank you very much. Chris, please.\n\nSpeaker 4 (01:22:23):\n\nSorry about that. Mr. President. Like Secretary Noem, I'm thrilled to be here to work with you on this simple platform you were elected on, which was to bring back the American dream, to bring jobs and opportunity for families across the country and to lower their costs so they can live their lives and expand the choices they have. You led off today talking about gasoline prices, I'll throw in diesel. If you correct for inflation, they're at multi-decade lows. This is a huge expense. This is a huge constraint on people's lives. We should celebrate that. Natural gas has become our main industrial fuel powering factories around the country. Natural gas prices are quite low in this country and they're lower than in any country in the world. The reason for that is the United States produces two times more natural gas than the second largest natural gas producer in the world, and four times more natural gas than the number three and number four producers in the world.\n\n(01:23:27)So you've opened up American opportunity in energy together with the work of Secretary Burgum, Administrator Zeldin, Secretary Lutnick, Secretary Rawlins. We've made it easy to produce energy in America again and those benefits are flowing. I could go on about this stuff forever, but let me talk about one specific area of energy, electricity. That's in the front of people's minds. When the day you were inaugurated, we got hold of all the data and we can look at the resource plans of utilities across the country. What you inherited when you arrived was a plan over the next five years to close a hundred gigawatts of reliable electric generation. So that's a hundred large power plants. Now that was offset with the plan to build 22 gigawatts of reliable electricity generation. Their plan was to close more than four times as much electricity generating capacity as they were going to build in that five year period. How do we lead the world in artificial intelligence if we're shrinking our supply of reliable electricity?\n\n(01:24:39)How do we reshore steel and aluminum and automobiles and semiconductors and all those jobs Americans want back in our country when we're degrading and shrinking our energy system? We were going to hand that leadership to China in artificial intelligence, not just to our economic loss, but to our huge national security loss. Your team around this table, and almost everyone around this table is involved in it, is just to completely pivot dramatically. We're stopping the closure of all these plants way before their retirement date. Some plants get to their end of life. That's a small percent of the plan closures. Most of those were just political nonsense at the cost to American taxpayers. So we have rapid new construction of power plants under in the United States. We're doing everything we can with suppliers who build the equipment for these power plants. They've got to build their factories bigger to build power plants in America. People thought those days were past, we weren't going to build big things in America anymore.\n\n(01:25:40)We're just going to keep sending it over to Asia and overseas and just buy other people's stuff. Totally nuts economically, totally nuts for national security and of course crushing for working Americans, particularly Americans that work with their hands. But we are seeing a revitalization of those people, of that optimism. You showed that picture of that plant being built in Arkansas, dozens of those under constructions just in artificial intelligence, but the reshoring of steel, of aluminum, of plastics, of fertilizer, semiconductors. Like, America's the land of opportunity. How did we get to become this awesome nation? Because we believed in the American dream and we leaned in on it. But the wealthy in our country and the coastal elites that live away from where stuff's actually made, they just lost their way and politicians just let them have it. Your tireless campaign and your relentless messaging made people realize the American dream isn't dead, it's just been smothered and we're un-smothering it and setting it loose. God bless your efforts. God bless your assembly of this team around the table. We're bringing the American dream back.\n\nPresident Donald Trump (01:26:53):\n\nThank you, Chris. Great job you're doing. Appreciate it. Laurie, please.\n\nLaurie (01:26:57):\n\nMr. President, everybody here who spoke works at the Department of Labor, clearly, which I love. They have all the correct talking points, but I think that's a testament again that we are all working together every single day, we talk to each other often and the workforce, the skilled workforce, the education factor, retirees, it's been so important because they all touch the Department of Labor, and I have the opportunity to work with every single one. If you all haven't stopped by the Department of Labor, Mr. President, I invite you to see your big beautiful face on a banner in front of the Department of Labor because you are really the transformational president of the American worker along with the American flag and President Roosevelt because we're bringing business and labor together and I was so honored to unveil that yesterday and everybody is taking note of that.\n\n(01:27:48)You also mentioned crime, and I think it's been important for my colleagues to recognize that now American workers can return to work and feel safe, that business owners aren't shutting down their businesses because they're afraid they can't protect their workers and now it's open for business again and it's starting right here in our nation's capital. Many things have been mentioned about consumer confidence, unemployment is holding steady and more than 2 million net jobs for native-born Americans has been key. Under your leadership, 84% of the workforce and jobs has been produced by the private sector. I think that was the mission of this administration and the Department of Labor. And I will continue to say for a little bit longer, until I heard you today, the one big beautiful bill because it equals one big beautiful workforce. And Congress passed this legislation, it probably will be the single most important bill that they did sign because it is protecting our American workforce by expanding Pell Grants and childcare and reduction in taxes that they can keep more of their hard-earned dollars.\n\n(01:28:55)I am, at the Department of Labor, announcing $30 million in grants for our skilled workforce, that I have an MOU with Secretary McMahon, I have an MOU with Administrator Loeffler. That's important to share the data points on how important this is. In June, we awarded nearly $84 million in grants for the capacity of what? Registered apprenticeships, an executive order to have 1 million active apprentices across this nation where we've already registered 185,000 since in the last few months. One of the other things that we have done is the Biden administration's guidance on cryptocurrency. And thanks to you and your leadership on that, we've rolled that back, and of course we're going to see the four-oh-one-K, the investors in our alternative assets. That's been key through the Department of Labor to work through. Partnering with our agencies, again, as I mentioned before, is important as we work together. I have visited, I'll be 31 states on my fifty-state tour by the end of this month.\n\n(01:29:56)I'm headed with Secretary Duffy, with the South Korean President Lee today as we move through the ship building, we will do that in Philly and then I'm off to New England to talk to those states about how important the apprenticeship program is. But while I visited Hexel in Salt Lake City, a hundred percent domestic carbon fiber for the Department of Defense, as they produce, they are announcing another billion dollar investment per your executive order on advanced manufacturing. So it is working. Everything that you have been saying since you were elected and since we all can put into play, has been working. Ohio, McDonald's is investing 375,000 new jobs, the shrimpers I visited as well, and they need our help in protecting that industry for our American fishermen and shrimpers. In Minnesota, I toured Cambria. When we're talking about quartz countertops, all made in America. And again in Oregon, where we are expecting a crackdown, thank you for what you are doing with your agents on ICE, and thank you for the prosecution that I hope you will come to Portland, Oregon and crack down.\n\n(01:31:06)But while there are still good people, I was able to visit Buckeye Pacific, really a trading floor for the timber industry. So we still want to focus on great, hardworking American businesses. Mr. President, I couldn't be more excited to ring in Labor Day in Erie, Pennsylvania for the Labor Day Parade. I will be there to welcome it. It is an honor to serve this country. It is an honor to serve under your administration as the labor secretary, and we will kick off, and Republicans will own Labor Day again. Not Democrats, we will own it because we are and you are the president of the American worker, so thank you for everything that you've done.\n\nPresident Donald Trump (01:31:41):\n\nThank you very much, Laurie.\n\nLaurie (01:31:42):\n\nAbsolutely.\n\nPresident Donald Trump (01:31:43):\n\nYou're doing a fantastic job. And I will tell you that Laurie was recommended by the Teamsters. And I said, \"That doesn't really work, does it?\" And it turned out to be one of our best choices, so I just want to thank you and Sean, who, as you know, recommended you very strongly. You really turned out to be a gem. Thank you.\n\nLaurie (01:32:05):\n\nI was able to talk to the president on the phone the other day. He called and visited and he said, \"But I know that you were a little bit middle of the road and not so sure.\" I said, \"Mr. President, I have been a Republican.\" He's like, \"What? Wait, what? Now I like you even more.\"\n\nPresident Donald Trump (01:32:20):\n\nYou did a great job.\n\nLaurie (01:32:20):\n\nI appreciate it.\n\nPresident Donald Trump (01:32:21):\n\nThank you, Laurie. Thank you. Pam.\n\nPam (01:32:22):\n\nPresident, I'm working with everyone around this table almost daily on legal issues that we're winning on. But today, because it's Labor Day, President Trump, if I could focus on public safety, not only domestic, but from our foreign adversaries. And Secretary McMahon, I know you know kids are out of school this weekend, it's Labor Day. And Secretary Duffy, you know our highways are going to be packed with travelers coming to not only our nation's capital, but all over this country. We're also going to have boaters, Secretary Duffy, right on our waterways. It is illegal to be under the influence and on a boat, so get a designated boater if you're out on our waterways, whether it's the Potomac or the Gulf of America or the Pacific, wherever you're out this weekend, people need to be safe.\n\n(01:33:11)And on an international level, Secretary Rubio, thank you for all your help on everything. We're doing [inaudible 01:33:18] everyone around this room, but yesterday there was a big, big win. El Mayo pled guilty and he was the co-founder of Sinaloa Cartel with El Chapo. And there's even a Narcos Netflix series about these guys. Well, now we know the ending. He's going to die in an American prison. They are one of the worst, El Chapo and El Mayo, some of the worst narco traffickers in our world, and he will spend life in prison now. And that's so important because those guys, and others throughout this country, throughout this world, have brought into our country drugs, cocaine, heroin, fentanyl, methamphetamines that's killing our kids, and we have to stop that. And that's what you've been doing not only in D.C, but around the country at your leadership. And over the weekend, parents need to know, with kids out of school, with people out on our highways and on our waters, do not take a pill from anyone you know, don't know, do not buy anything on the street.\n\n(01:34:25)It could be laced with something toxic. We've seen so many Fentanyl overdoses. And when you were here in D.C, we showed you pictures of some of the drugs that had been seized right here in D.C. President, they were packaged for children, packaged for children, and people are dying from these around our country. So thank you President Trump for your leadership and for letting Americans know that it's now a safe place to go. But parents also have to know, college kids have to know to be vigilant and not take this trash because you could be thinking you're taking a Xanax, an Adderall, anything, and it could be laced with something very lethal.\n\nPresident Donald Trump (01:35:05):\n\nIt's a great message.\n\nPam (01:35:05):\n\nThank you, President Trump.\n\nPresident Donald Trump (01:35:08):\n\nGreat message. And you've been fantastic this last 12 days in D.C, the job you and your whole group has done is…\n\nPam (01:35:13):\n\nAll of us.\n\nPresident Donald Trump (01:35:14):\n\nEveryone's talking about it all over the world. I hate to have to talk about that, but we have to. It's becoming a very safe place again. I've seen how hard you worked the last, well, from the beginning in all fairness, but this focus on D.C is so important for the country, so great job. And to everybody, great job.\n\nPam (01:35:34):\n\nAnd president, it's the team around, we're all working hand in hand, side by side, all of our agencies together to make America safe and D.C safe. And Iris, congratulations on your baby and I'm so glad that you're safe now.\n\nIris (01:35:47):\n\nThank very much.\n\nPresident Donald Trump (01:35:53):\n\nThank you. Thank you very much, Pam. Mr. VP, would you like to say something?\n\nVice President (01:35:54):\n\nYes, sir. I'll be brief, but I want to congratulate you and the entire team on all the things that have been accomplished. You'll hear about a lot of it. You've already heard some of it. But I thought it would be helpful, Mr. President, just to take stock, not just of what we've accomplished, what we will accomplish, but of the mess that we inherited because I think it makes this first Labor day a bigger and more special occasion. You heard, I think, Kristi talk about this, that all of the net job growth under the Biden administration had gone to the foreign-born, now that net job growth is going to American citizens who deserve opportunity in their own country. That's a great accomplishment. You'll hear, I'm sure, Scott talk about the success with tariffs. People forget that we inherited the largest peacetime deficit in the history of the United States of America, and now because the president is not letting foreign countries take advantage of us, we're collecting hundreds of billions of dollars, trillions of dollars over 10 years in tariffs from countries and companies that were formerly taking advantage of the American people.\n\n(01:36:49)You heard Pam talk about the public safety and the success that we've had there. I happen to believe that maybe the most sacred thing that we can deliver to American workers is the ability to live safely and comfortably in their own neighborhoods. Public safety is not just something that should belong to the wealthy, it should belong to every working man and woman in the United States of America. And because of the work of this administration, that is happening. And of course, Mr. president, you yourself talked about the inflation mess that we inherited under the Biden administration. Maybe the most striking and even shocking statistic of the Biden administration is that housing costs had gone up by a hundred percent over the four years of the Biden administration. Literally doubled, making the American dream of home ownership unaffordable. We've made great strides and great progress already, but to the American people who are listening, there's a lot more to do. We're going to keep on working hard at it, but it's an honor to do this job under the President's leadership and with this very great team that you've assembled.\n\n(01:37:42)So we've done a lot, but there's a lot more work to do and we're very cognizant of it. Thank you, sir.\n\nPresident Donald Trump (01:37:45):\n\nGreat job. Thank you, JD. Scott.\n\nScott (01:37:49):\n\nSir, as we've said very often, economic security is national security and our country has never been so secure thanks to you. You have brought us back from the edge. You have the overwhelming mandate from the American people. You're restoring confidence in government. A topic that is on the front of everyone's mind, the Federal Reserve. The Federal Reserve's independence comes from a political arrangement between itself and the American public. Having the public's trust is the only thing that gives it credibility. And you, sir, are restoring trust to government. You are weeding out the waste, fraud, and abuse and the old ways of doing things are not good enough. We are seeing a blue collar boom in the first seven months of your administration. Real blue collar wages have taken off, and the only other time that they've done this in the past 70 years was in your previous term. Your efforts on tax, trade and deregulation have boosted paychecks for American workers while slowing the pace\n\nScott (01:39:00):\n\n… Of inflation and lowering the cost of energy inflation has plummeted to just 1.9% since you took office. And the economy rebounded with real GDP surging 3% last quarter. The blue collar boom coincides with a CapEx comeback. In anticipation of your one Big Beautiful Bill, the coming law, CapEx increased by American businesses by nearly 14% in the first half of this year. And as you and I talk about frequently and as that chart or that photo attest, we are going to see, I believe a bigger CapEx boom from here. This is just the beginning, just the beginning. You have saved this country by making it the best place in the world to do business again. Treasury is helping to implement these new provisions as well as no tax on tips, no tax on overtime, no tax on social security. This weekend I will be meeting with workers from local restaurants to discuss the positive impacts of the pro-labor reforms on no tax on tips.\n\n(01:40:13)And I have to tell you, thanks to you when I go into a restaurant or stop by a hotel doorman, I am the most popular person there. And since my first job at age nine was as a busboy getting tips, I am going to spend Labor Day going from restaurant to restaurant, talking to workers who receive substantial amount of tip income. So I'll hear directly from them how your one Big Beautiful Bill is increasing their take-home pay and making a big difference. Now, we can also talk, that is domestic. On the international front, you have leveled the international trading system whereby countries took advantage of us. And that's over. It's over. The Treasury Department is taking in record tariff revenues that I had been saying was running at a rate of 300 billion a year. You chastise me for saying that that number is too low and as usual, you are right, that we had a substantial jump from July to August and I think we're going to see a bigger jump from August to September. So I think we could be on our way well over half a trillion, maybe towards the trillion dollar number. This administration, your administration has made a meaningful dent in the budget deficit. The average budget deficit during this term is 26% less than the last 12 months under Biden. And even the CBO, and we don't agree with CBO on everything as you said, last Friday, on a summer Friday, had to admit that they believe over the next 10 years the budget deficit will be four trillion lower than they had previously scored. Four trillion, 3.3 trillion of tariff income, 700 billion of lower interest costs. And I would expect that that number could go up from here. So Mr. President, your return to the White House marked the return of the American worker. Thank you for reclaiming Labor Day for the American people. You're growing the economy for everyone, especially the middle and lower income households who suffered disproportionately under the last administration. And it's an honor to do this under your leadership.\n\nPresident Donald Trump (01:42:48):\n\nGreat job. You're doing great. Thank you very much, Scott. Brooke.\n\nBrooke (01:42:52):\n\nSir, I dropped my second son off at college last week and I wasn't planning to say this, but just listening to everybody. I wanted to put a little bit of a personal touch on this work. He started his freshman year yesterday at Texas A&M for all my SEC friends in the room. Thank you for saving college football, by the way. We're all very grateful. The country just feels different. It just feels different. There's such a optimism and a love. There's a faith movement going through, especially with our younger Americans. And for those of us with kids in college, I know we feel it and I experienced it firsthand last week moving him and my other older son in as well. As we move toward Labor Day, you have made a lot of dreams come true for a lot of people, but one of my longtime dreams was for the right to recapture Labor Day.\n\n(01:43:51)And I've been talking about this for almost 20 years in writing about it, that why are we ceding the day that we are celebrating the American worker to the Democrats? Because this is our day, perhaps of any day of the entire year, this is our day. America was founded and fought for by fishermen and farmers, and workmen, and etc. The Genesis, the first book of the Bible talks about the righteousness of work and the art of creation. And so, to be part of this effort to represent the farmers, the ranchers, the agriculture industry at this moment in time, which I do believe we're in a revolution, 1776 was the first one, 1863 or so with Abraham Lincoln was the second. This is the third, with Donald Trump leading the way. And we are saving America. And the idea that we are putting the worker, the very central component of the American dream at the center of it is the reason that it is so.\n\n(01:44:55)So, at USDA it continues to be my greatest honor to fight for the original American worker, who I think the farmer is and what they represent. And as we are building new systems and new structures as we have, this year you're going to have the best harvest on record for our rowcroppers and others, what this team has done and is doing to open up those markets to ensure that these farmers can continue to return prosperity to rural America.\n\n(01:45:24)I'll finish with this. This morning we had a working group with six of our cabinet members. Bobby Kennedy representing healthcare, Linda McMahon education, Lee Zeldin deregulation, Kelly Leffler small business, Lori Chavez-DeRemer labor, and Scotty Turner housing. And how you leading the way in your vision, how that will return the golden age to rural America, to the very fabric of our country and whether it's better hospitals, better education, more opportunity, less government, better and bigger small businesses, better opportunities for our workers and better housing. And of course the agriculture piece of that through the Big Beautiful Bill, the bill, what it did, the greatest investment in rural America in history. And now the opportunity to effectuate that is again a game-changer, a country-saver and what a joy to be able to do it under your leadership. So thank you, sir.\n\nPresident Donald Trump (01:46:17):\n\nVery good. Thank you. You have stated, thank you very much. Scott.\n\nScott (01:46:22):\n\nYes, sir. Thank you Mr. President. I'm so grateful to be here to celebrate Labor Day with the greatest team in America. And it is football season, so I'm happy about that. But Mr. President, I want to say thank you for, as Brooke said, reclaiming Labor Day. And you've been a tremendous champion for the American worker. I come from a hardworking family as many people around this table do. And so, thank you for helping us to change the conversation. And I believe we are changing the conversation around the kitchen table.\n\n(01:47:01)And as everybody knows, my job is to steward HUD. And we have, at HUD, been very intentional about changing the conversation about the dignity of work, and the dignity and the honor of family formation through work, and how the younger generation, when they see their parents' work, how they're incentivized to work. And that America is not a welfare state, but America was built on small business, it was built on entrepreneurship. And so, as it pertains to housing, we're being very focused on that. And even some that receive HUD funding to make sure, like a section three, when you receive HUD funding, that you are given opportunities for the most vulnerable Americans that you serve, to have work, to have opportunities to work, to have work requirements. Work requirements are not a bad word. That's a great word. Time limits is a great word to incentivize people; able-bodied, able- minded people to work.\n\n(01:48:02)And I believe that we are under your leadership, sir, changing that conversation in America to where working is an honorable thing. And Secretary Wright talked about revitalization. Revitalization means to bring new life. And I believe we're bringing new life to America, Mr. President, through work and through all the jobs that people are doing around this table. And with the one Big Beautiful Bill, the bill, the most extensive tax break in American history, opportunity zones are now made permanent. And you know how passionate I am and you are too, sir, about opportunity zones. And so, this will allow us to continue to build affordable housing around our country. And Mr. Vice President, I'm coming your way. I'm coming to Columbus later this week and to see how we can continue to build affordable housing in our country with opportunity zones. One million people, Mr. President, were lifted out of poverty because of opportunity zones.\n\n(01:49:01)$90 billion of private money was invested in opportunity zones, urban, tribal, and rural. And now that they've been made permanent, we're looking for millions more to be lifted out of poverty, a hundred billion dollars to be invested, hundreds of thousands of jobs to be created, hundreds of thousands of units of housing to come online. And so, sir, I sit here very excited about the future of this country. I'm very proud to be at this table, humble to do so at HUD. We're on a good path. So thank you for all your support in helping us, sir.\n\nPresident Donald Trump (01:49:35):\n\nThank you very much. A pleasure.\n\nScott (01:49:36):\n\nGod bless you.\n\nPresident Donald Trump (01:49:37):\n\nAnd I want to give credit to Tim Scott, great senator from a place called South Carolina that we love, right? And Tim really came up with opportunity zones and we did a good job of working with them, and together we created something that nobody speaks of very much, but it's probably the most successful thing that's ever been done of its kind. It's been amazing. So Tim Scott deserves a lot of credit for that. Thank you.\n\nScott (01:50:03):\n\nThank you.\n\nPresident Donald Trump (01:50:05):\n\nRussell, go ahead.\n\nRussell (01:50:06):\n\nThank you, Mr. President and I get the opportunity to go hand by hand with all of these people as they move their deregs to the Office of Management and Budget. And I wanted to zoom out for a second. In the first term, you gave us a goal of two for one, and then we outperformed it through your leadership. We came in at around five and a half, six for one. And then, as you're running for your second term, you put out a goal that when you put it out, I was thinking to myself, \"That's going to be a pretty ambitious goal.\"\n\n(01:50:33)You said 10 for one. Well, where we are right now in one year, basically eight months, we are at 245 deregulatory initiatives planned by these agencies. That comes out to 30 for one. So we are making incredible strides and as you're focused on the details of each one, I mean, these aren't small things. Endangerment finding is one of the most deregulatory things we've in the history of this country. NEPA reform, incredibly deregulatory. WOTUS just came in, which is Waters of the United States. So every single one of these agencies is doing incredible work when it comes to deregulatory. And we add that to the work being done to get us going on energy, reduced spending, we're going to lower costs for the American people. We're going to be able to have innovative jobs and get them back to work. So thank you for your leadership, Mr. President.\n\nPresident Donald Trump (01:51:30):\n\nThank you. Great job, Russell. Appreciate it. John. Central casting, I call him.\n\nJohn (01:51:37):\n\nWell, Mr. President, I'm grateful to be with everyone today as we're talking about jobs and workforce. At CIA, consistent with your directives to all of us, we've embraced your mantra for a leaner, more effective, more efficient workforce. But at CIA, Mr. President, we had an additional challenge, because as you know, at times our workforce had been misdirected, its focus put on political narratives, some that even worked against you and always worked against the American people.\n\nPresident Donald Trump (01:52:12):\n\nI heard about that.\n\nJohn (01:52:15):\n\nBut under your leadership and your direction, we have been focused back on the core mission of what CIA is supposed to be doing, which is to provide you and this entire incredible team around the table with a decisive strategic advantage in accomplishing your goals. And your success in that regard, the examples are clear and many. With regard to Iran, everyone knows that our DOD partners executed that mission flawlessly, but flawless military operations are subject to flawless intelligence. And as you know, Mr. President, CIA was the backbone in terms of its intelligence operations in providing that flawless execution that allowed you and your team to obliterate Iranian nuclear facilities and set back a nuclear program by years.\n\n(01:53:04)Likewise, with regard to your ability to prevent and to preempt wars between India and Pakistan, between Armenia and Azerbaijan, between Rwanda and the Democratic Republic of Congo, in all those cases, CIA intelligence supported you and your entire team in making that possible. It's not just you, it's folks around this table, secretary Bessent, secretary Luckman, trade representative Greer, and their great successful negotiations on trade and tariffs. Again, it was a CIA workforce working to enable them to accomplish your goals. So as we roll into Labor Day, I tell you that the CIA workforce at the Trump CIA is grateful to be focused on what it's supposed to be, which is helping you prevent and end wars, and to make America safer.\n\nPresident Donald Trump (01:53:54):\n\nOkay, thank you very much. You've been really fantastic, but I'm not surprised. I've known John a long time. I'm not surprised at all. Thank you very much. Steve, please.\n\nSteve (01:54:05):\n\nMr. President, working for this government for you is the greatest honor of my life. I tell it to everybody and I really do feel that way, and I thank you, because it's a privilege to go out there and represent you in your humanitarian effort, in your goals of solving conflicts all over the world. I think there were actually more than seven conflicts that you've put to bed in the last eight months, and I travel all over the world. In Hostage Square, they talk about you reverentially. It's really quite amazing. I sometimes wish that I had a cam recorder with me and I could put you right there as I listened to it. I was in Gaza, the first American diplomat on your behalf. And as we delivered food and aid pursuant to your new aid initiative, pushed forth by your great Secretary of State, Marco Rubio, who it is a privilege for me to work alongside, the people were applauding you, the signs were up.\n\n(01:55:14)I mean, these are people who, I just don't think you get the proper credit for it all. We are negotiating multiple entries into the Abraham Peace Accords because of your vision. Azerbaijan, all these different conflicts that we are out there on your behalf on, these are people who have never really seen the world change in this way. Peace through strength really, really works. Russia, Ukraine, Iran, Israel, Hamas, we're having meetings all this week on all three of those conflicts and we hope to settle them before the end of this year. Your team is nothing short of incredible, and there's only one thing I wish for, that that that Nobel Committee finally gets its act together and realizes that you are the single finest candidate since the Nobel Peace, this Nobel Award was ever talked about. To receive that reward beyond your success is game-changing out in the world today. And I hope everybody one day wakes up and realizes that.\n\nPresident Donald Trump (01:56:26):\n\nThank you, Steve. Jameson, please.\n\nJameson (01:56:28):\n\nMr. President, I like to think of Labor Day as the Trump Trade Policy Day, because everyone around this table and everyone listening knows that one of the major reasons why American workers and organized labor voted for you is because of your trade policy, and the policy you've had and advocated for 40 years or more. You have reset global trade policy in the past few months and it shows that it's been working for American workers. When you look at President Biden in the last quarter of 2024, median weekly earnings felt 2.1%. In the first quarter of your term, they went up 3.3%.\n\n(01:57:07)And that's why we're doing the trade policy we're doing. It's to help the workers of the United States of America, and they're the best in the world, that they can't do it without a level playing field. And you have flipped the script. For many years, the other countries had high tariffs and high non-tariff barriers while we were open to all of their labor and services, and goods and capital. You flipped it. Now we have the tariffs and they have lowered their non-tariff barriers, and we couldn't have done it without you and the levers you've created. So between the tariffs and the deals, the hot streak continues for the workers of America. So thank you.\n\nPresident Donald Trump (01:57:39):\n\nThank you very much. Really good job, by the way. It's good negotiator. Good negotiator. Thank you. [inaudible 01:57:50]\n\nSpeaker 5 (01:57:50):\n\nWell, Mr. President, I feel like as everybody here has talked about how great working with this team is and all, but I do feel a special need that you've given me the privilege of working with the best of America. I get to take care of the veterans. I get to take care of the veterans who Labor Day really finds its roots in, if you think about it. We wouldn't have Labor Day if it wasn't for men and women who would leave their jobs and go fight this nation's battles to keep us free and independent, so that they would have jobs to come home to. And over the past few years, they've been coming home to many times, a government that was keeping them back, holding them back, taxing them, regulating them. And now we have veterans who represent the bill, the Big Beautiful Bill, they're the beneficiaries of, and I get to see them all the time. Because they're receiving the benefit because they see the jobs, they see the care that they're being given.\n\n(01:58:38)And these veterans can look at their country with pride, knowing that we're taking care of them just like you told me to do. When your only statements, you said to me, I asked you what to do, you said, \"Go take care of my veterans.\" That's what we're doing. One of the other things that we're doing right now is for many of you, I love to hear how you're deregulating everything. And I've worked from Congress and worked with many of you before. I get to do the same thing with the largest bureaucratic organization in the government. We're deregulating from the inside. And it's amazing to me, because we have such a powerful workforce at the VA who really want to do good, but yet they kept tripping themselves up. They kept making their own. We'd take one step forward and put a regulation in, and put them three steps back and it always hurt our veterans at the end.\n\n(01:59:14)We're taking that away. We're making community care again, Mr. President, we talked about this yesterday. We're making community care part of our direct care system. So if a veteran wants to get into the community, they have our direct care and they also have the ability to go into the community. Something that the previous administration decided, they wanted to keep everybody inside, because they thought it was a fiefdom they were building. I'm telling you, we're not building a fiefdom at the VA. We're trying to take care of a service organization that takes care of veterans. So how do we do that? We make best medical interest, where a doctor can send a veteran to the community a lot quicker without having to worry about miles and time log, and wait times, just get them the help they need. We've actually expanded out and it's made a difference in this regulation, and also unleashed a workforce that is now free of the collective bargaining agreements and other things that have kept them from being able to do the job of national security that they've been intended to.\n\n(02:00:01)I'm actually giving them the benefit of the doubt to actually go be the workers that they're called to be. And that's what Labor Day is about. The VA is going to have the best workers, but just to let you know how that's working out. Wait times that our hospital are going down, because we're getting in our hospitals, we're into community care. And then one for you, Mr. President, you heard about this a lot, and that was backlogs. The backlog when I first came in, and I've said this before in February, we had over 260,000 backlogs. That means over 125 days of not getting an answer. In just a little over four and a half months, we've dropped that over a hundred thousand. We're under 150 and heading down to historic lows, we'll be within the next month lower than any time under the previous administration at all.\n\n(02:00:40)That means our veterans are getting the help they need. So when you look at it this way, we've opened new facilities, we've put new facilities in places where workers can get to. We've expanded out hours, over a million extra hours. So younger veterans in particular can get off of work and bring their sales, and get their appointments in after hours on Saturdays. That's what it means to be in the Trump administration. That's what it means to take care of veterans. That's what it means for Labor Day, because you can't forget the ones who fought for us to be on this table today. And it's all because of what you've done in the progress that we've made.\n\nPresident Donald Trump (02:01:11):\n\nWell, you've done a tremendous job. And I hear it all the time. We have a 93% approval rating at the VA now. And you know what it was before, it was like horrible. So thank you very much.\n\nSpeaker 6 (02:01:25):\n\nMr. President, there's been some conversation about the Pete and Bobby challenge. I would just note that I don't think Pete or Bobby could hold these sticks for two and a half hours. They want that to be the challenge, so be it. But I think 50 pull-ups and a hundred push-ups might be easy in comparison.\n\nPresident Donald Trump (02:01:45):\n\nWe didn't have this problem with Biden. He's in and out very quickly.\n\nSpeaker 6 (02:01:50):\n\nSo kudos on Labor Day to the audio team that's holding the sticks. But Mr. President, it's pretty great to celebrate Labor Day with a builder who loves labor, who loves the men and women who have built this country, the people that sweat, that have great skills, they have grit. They do the dirty jobs of America that have made this country great and you know them very well, because you have worked with them. The great Trump projects have come from the very men and women we're going into this weekend to celebrate.\n\n(02:02:21)We all want to claim Labor Day in our departments, but I'm going to claim this at DOT, because roads, bridges, pipelines, shipbuilding, rail, passenger, and freight all fall under the great men and women who wear boots and make this country wonderful. And at DOT, we don't want to have the Congress spend money. We want to the money that Congress gives us and actually deploy it, and put these men and women to work building the great projects of this country, the use of the big beautiful projects that connect this country. And that's why we have got rid of the DEI. We've got rid of the green. We've done what we can to streamline the regulation to move these projects faster. Time is money and time has been money. Even Democrats agree now that it takes too long to go through the regulatory process. So we're going to move these projects faster, putting the great American worker back to work.\n\n(02:03:21)I want to make a quick comment. We've all probably talked about this horrific accident in Florida, and I appreciate the help of Christie and Marco on this very issue. But in May we said, \"Listen, it's a safety issue if you can't proficiently speak the English language.\" And we gave states a little over a month to comply. And Washington, California and New Mexico have refused to comply. And by way, the way this individual in Florida received a CDL from Washington, from California and received a speeding ticket after our rule went into place and they didn't stop him. And had they taken him out of service, he wouldn't have been in Florida. And we would have three beautiful people alive today. And I make that point, because it's the work that maybe no one sees that then shines a light when horrific things happen. But also that your cabinet works together and teams up to make a difference for the American people.\n\n(02:04:20)Real quickly. So we have a safety mission at DOT. I don't know that you'd think of the transit unions in the greatest cities of the country, New York maybe being one of them that support us. But they do, because the violence in the subways and on our buses across the country, the transit workers are the ones who take the most abuse and they're grateful for the mission of everybody around this table fighting to make their communities safer. So I appreciate everyone's help on that. But again, the transit unions love the effort that all of us have putting together. One quick FAA. We are about to put out a request for proposals for a Big Beautiful Bill. We got 12.5 billion in the Big Beautiful Bill. We need more, but this is a great start. I expect the middle to the later part of July, we will be through the process to bring the proposed integrators to you for selection.\n\n(02:05:17)So we're looking forward to that. We will have the most, I'm learning from you, this is going to be the greatest contract ever crafted in the federal government for this build for air traffic control. Really it's innovative. When we have unique tools at FAA, it's going to be a great contract. Bobby left me out of the windmill conversation, Bobby. So there was a study done in the last administration that said if you build windmills 1.2 miles, within 1.2 miles from our roadway, it can mess up the automation and technology on a car. Same thing 1.2 miles from rail. The last administration buried that report, Mr. President. And so, now what we've said is what we're going to do is say, \"Listen, I'm sorry. It is a safety risk to build windmills this close to roads.\"\n\n(02:06:05)By the way, they want to build them by roads. And by rail we're going to say, \"No more. It is a safety risk. And we have a report to show that.\" This real quick.\n\nPresident Donald Trump (02:06:12):\n\nIt's a good idea. It's great.\n\nSpeaker 6 (02:06:14):\n\nIt's a good team effort. I wasn't invited to the party, but I'm still going throw party. Maybe next time, Bobby. One last thing. We have this Mars to Moon mission at NASA. No, Moon to Mars mission. Sorry about that. But sometimes people think that space doesn't matter to them. But if you look at every rocket that's launched, the machinists, the truck drivers, the electricians, the welders that build these rockets, and the industry that has developed over the course of the last 10 years in space, it's truly remarkable. It's not just rich guys setting up rockets in partnership with NASA. There's a whole industry of working men and women who we celebrate this weekend that build, refurbish, design the rockets that are making America the leader in space. So thank you for your leadership and happy to celebrate thank this weekend with you, Mr. President.\n\nPresident Donald Trump (02:07:05):\n\nReally great. And he is doing a good job at NASA too. And we are, I think we'll have some pretty exciting announcements.\n\nSpeaker 6 (02:07:13):\n\nYes.\n\nPresident Donald Trump (02:07:13):\n\nAnd you enjoy it.\n\nSpeaker 6 (02:07:14):\n\nIt's been fun.\n\nPresident Donald Trump (02:07:15):\n\nI said, \"How about temporary?\"\n\n(02:07:16)He said, \"Well, can I go a little bit longer?\" He loves it. He loves it. And he's doing a really good job. Thank you very much. Appreciate it. Howard, please.\n\nHoward (02:07:25):\n\nSo making America great again is one of the key statements and people don't always understand what you mean. So we always talk about 1870 to 1913, but in the mid 1980s, America owned more of the rest of the world than they owned of us. We owned $140 billion of the rest of the world net of what they owned of us. And when you came into office this time, the rest of the world owned $24 trillion more of our assets than we owned of theirs. And so, when people argue with you about the trade deficit is nothing, the trade deficit sends 1.2 trillion of our dollars to them. And what do they do with it? They buy the Great America. Because when we learned in college, what we learned was that if you keep printing these dollars, they're supposed to devalue. But the problem is we're two smart. We invented the light bulb, the transistor, the GPU.\n\n(02:08:33)So they keep buying us and the only president ever to understand it. And you understood it in the '80s and the '90s. And I used to see you on TV and you'd say, \"God, what are these people doing?\"\n\n(02:08:46)And finally we've changed it. So let's go over what we changed. So Japan and Korea, they're never going to open their markets to us. So we've negotiated $900 billion that they're giving you to invest in national and economic security in America. The European Union, the second-largest economy, $20 trillion. And all the experts said you'd never get a deal done with them. And watching you in Scotland was my favorite thing. 15%, they'll pay us 15% and we will pay zero. So we can export to their $20 trillion economy and they can pay to come to the great American consumer. So couple of other things. Four days before you took office, four days before you took office, the Commerce department which had the chips money, they set up this thing called Natcast, which was a make-believe not-for-profit.\n\n(02:09:49)And they signed contracts to wire them $7.4 billion. This was just nonsense. So we stopped the payment, we've got the money. It's an illegal thing to try to set up a department that's not the Department of Commerce that kind of acts like the Department of Commerce. And what was it filled with? All these people who worked for the Biden administration. I mean, it's exact corruption that you talk about. $7.4 billion now clawed back. Last week was the most fun. In one week, intel came in, the Biden administration had given $11 billion to Intel, given it to them, done. Corporate, just gift.\n\n(02:10:34)And you turn that into really it was like less than five minutes of conversation. And Intel agreed to give us 10% of their company, which of course was worth $11 billion. So it's not socialism, this is capitalism. If you give someone $11 billion who's just building in America, they're not doing something special, they're building in America. And their CEO told the president he didn't need the grant. And you said, \"Well then, why don't we get something for it?\"\n\n(02:11:06)So it's amazing. You go on to watch semiconductors come home, right? We don't produce semiconductors. We've got 165 billion for TSMC. But you are going to watch the whole ecosystem come home, because Donald Trump is the only president understands the magnet to make them come home is one word, which used to be your favorite word. Now it's dropped to number four, which is tariffs. Tariffs are going to bring semiconductors home. They are going to empower Bobby to execute MFN. Tariffs are going to be one of those tools that he's going to use to do that. We're going to do it for furniture. We're getting autos. We have steel, aluminum. I mean, it has been a blast. A blast. So two more things. The Department of Commerce is going to start issuing its statistics on the blockchain, because you are the crypto president\n\nHoward (02:12:00):\n\nAnd we are going to print out GDP on the blockchain so people can use the blockchain for data, distribution. And then we're going to make that available to the entire government. So all of you can do it. We're just ironing out all the details so we can do it. Patents. We have given tens, if not hundreds of billions of dollars to universities for them to do research. And they invent things. And who owns those patents? The universities. So we are going to make a deal with them all, which is if we give them the money, don't you think it's fair that the United States of America and the taxpayers who funded it get a piece of that, right? So we wrote a letter to Harvard, so Linda and I working together. It's so much fun to work with everybody here. We just have a blast because Linda's hitting Harvard. And she says, \"What can we do?\" And now we send them a patent letter and we'll hit them again. So we're having fun together. This is the greatest Cabinet working for the greatest President. And I just want to say thank you. I'm having the time of my life working for you, Mr. President.\n\nPresident Donald Trump (02:13:12):\n\nThank you. That was very well-stated, wasn't it? Some things people don't think of too much. Thank you very much. Great job. Pete.\n\nPete Hegseth (02:13:22):\n\nSir, well, amen to what Howard said. And I would just say heading into Labor Day from the American military, sir, we happen to be the largest employer in America. We like to think we have a different form of employees who need to be the toughest and the strongest and the most well-trained and the most lethal. And under the previous administration, and for decades, frankly, it was social justice, it was political correctness, it was divisive ideologies seeping into the ranks and changing how well we do our job. No more. Now it is only merit-based, gender-neutral, colorblind. The best of the best from the top to the bottom. That's our expectation. And sir, you've enabled that. So from the troops directly, which they ask me to say all the time, thank you for your leadership, for your boldness, for your clarity, for common sense, for providing a shield for the rest of us to put America first and to apply peace through strength. We're in the strength business. That's our job, is to stand behind everybody here, and alongside John, in everything they do to keep the country safe.\n\n(02:14:29)And the world is noticing. And I wish everybody could … There were two meetings yesterday that I think tell the story. One was … Because today happens to be the four-year anniversary of what happened in Abbey Gate in Afghanistan. Mr. President, you had the families in, who you've met with multiple times, who when the cameras were on and not on acknowledged, sir, you were the only one that gave them a proper greeting, that recognized what they gave, their sons and daughters in the debacle that was the withdraw in Afghanistan, that we will bring accountability for the Defense Department through our investigation.\n\nPresident Donald Trump (02:15:01):\n\nGood. That's good.\n\nPete Hegseth (02:15:02):\n\nBut at the same time, the world sadly took notice, whether it was Israel, whether it was Ukraine. Those wars never would've started if you were President. Instead, they looked at the foolishness of Joe Biden. Under your military, your Pentagon, we are restoring deterrence, whether it's Midnight Hammer and those beautiful B-2s 37 hours straight, whether it's counter-drug operations in our own hemisphere, whether it's the border, working with Kristi and the national security team, whether it's LA, whether it's Washington, DC, you name it, whether it's Europe. Our allies paying 5%.\n\n(02:15:34)Now our allies in the Indo-Pacific stepping up to do the same. That's a recognition that American leadership is here. And then in the second meeting, we were talking about what we're doing in DC. And Pam's taking the lead. I have to say, just pause for a second. When I look around this table, yes, there's a national security team of Steve Witkoff and John and Scott and Howard and the Vice President and Suzy and Kristi and Tulsi. But to every person here, we work together on a daily basis. And if you call me and I call you, the answer is, \"Yes. How do we do it together?\" I think that's exceptional. It's what the American people deserve. And you've demanded that, sir. So I very much appreciate it. In that meeting on DC, I started my sentence by saying, \"The Department of Defense,\" to which you said, \"That just doesn't sound right.\"\n\n(02:16:19)So maybe next time we're here, my card will read Department of War. We'll see. But it's not … Here's the thing. Here's what people miss. It's not just about words. It's about the warrior ethos. It's about what the department is supposed to do. George Washington started the Department of War because he wanted us to win our wars. Our founders didn't want endless foreign entanglements. They didn't want endless contingencies and deployments. They wanted an empowered military that was … The handcuffs were taken off to fight to win and then bring those troops home. So my platoon in Guantánamo Bay, our motto was, \"Those who long for peace must declare for war.\" We must prepare for war. We don't want war. We don't seek it. You are the peace President, sir. Because we are strong, our enemies know what we will do.\n\n(02:17:10)And so whether it's Secretary of War or Secretary of Defense, that warrior ethos is changing. We're going back to basics. Our drill instructors can be drill instructors again, sir. So from the minute of the tactical of standards to the strategic of B-2 bombers, we're focused on what matters. Had a meeting yesterday on Golden Dome for America, which is on track to deliver strategically for the American people. Munitions and the Deputy Secretary making sure. Our stockpiles are overflowing. That's our job. I'm honored to be a part of it, sir. Thank you for your leadership.\n\nPresident Donald Trump (02:17:41):\n\nThat's great. I think you'd like Department of War better, but we'll make that decision, right? But you've been great. Thank you very much.\n\nPete Hegseth (02:17:48):\n\nThank you, sir.\n\nPresident Donald Trump (02:17:50):\n\nSo Marco, go ahead.\n\nMarco Rubio (02:17:51):\n\nWell, Mr. President, first of all, everyone's made this comment already and needs to be echoed again. You were elected as the President of working Americans. And that's why this Labor Day is so meaningful. For me personally, this is the most meaningful Labor Day of my life as someone with four jobs. And so it's true. But on the point of … You made it very clear from the outset. Even in foreign policy, everything we did has to be pro-American. It has to make America stronger or safer or more prosperous. And there's just a few things I want to touch through because it involves your team under your leadership making it happen. The first is for the first time in the modern era, we are truly on offense against organized cartels that are pumping poison, killer poison into our cities. And that's a team effort. It's Kristi's team, it's Pete's team, it's Pam's team. And obviously, it's under your leadership.\n\n(02:18:44)And by the way, we're getting incredible economic international cooperation. Countries just in the last week, Ecuador, Paraguay, Guyana, Trinidad, today Argentina, all joining us or trying to be helpful in advancing this. One thing is there. We're going to stop drugs from coming in and we're having record seizures. But another thing is to build an international coalition against the scourge on the international stage. The second is mass migration, illegal mass migration, which is dangerous for the country, but harmful for American workers. What's happening on the border is essential, but it's not just what's happening on the border. And again, Kristi and her team have been essential in this. We have countries all over the world that are actually helping us, whether it's through safe third country agreements, whether through it's stopping the migration flow from coming here in the first place. Incredible and international cooperation. We've redefined our border. It's no longer just our physical border. We are doing things ahead of time to prevent this from happening and getting cooperations from countries that we've never seen before. And last I would say … And Steve touched upon this, who, by the way, is doing a phenomenal job. Steve is both a great negotiator and he's also a nice guy, which are two tough things to pull off together, but it's incredible. But we both work for the peacemaker and chief. Think about it, how fortunate we are as Americans to have a President who's made peace a priority. And just since the last time we've met, there was a war going on in Cambodia and Thailand, between Cambodia and Thailand. The President just picks up the phone and tells them to stop fighting. And within 72 hours, the fighting had stopped. There's no other leader in the world that could have done it.\n\n(02:20:12)And the fact that you were willing to spend time to do that and to make it happen is, of course, essential. And then the war that didn't happen because of Azerbaijan and Armenia coming here to sign that peace deal, which is historic in so many countries. You know how many countries set out? It's never going to happen. It isn't possible. And it occurred, Mr. President, because of your leadership. And then on a point of personal privilege, I wasn't even going to raise it. I haven't even talked to you about this. It's a little controversial, but I think I need to bring it up at this time of year. This thing about people getting married on Saturdays during college football season is a scourge, Mr. President. It's dividing families. And I don't know if we can have an executive order on this. I'm just saying. But it's really difficult. There's seven other months of the year that people could get married. So I just wanted to say that because it's very, very difficult. Thank you.\n\nPresident Donald Trump (02:20:56):\n\nThank you. Fantastic. [inaudible 02:20:58]. Thank you. Doug, please.\n\nDoug Burgum (02:21:02):\n\nWell, Mr. President, you've heard from round the table how people are grateful to have an opportunity to be part of this team, have an opportunity to work for you, and have an opportunity to serve the American people. And I would say as we head into this Labor Day, the thing that really differentiates you and your leadership and everybody around this table is one word. And that's respect. Because this is a group of people that respect our farmers and ranchers. We respect the people that are in law enforcement. That's a huge change. Respecting the people that are in uniform, respecting our veterans, respecting our shrimp fishermen, whoever it is in this country, people that are building our roads. This whole group embodies that sense of respect. And when we start with that, and then who benefits? We come up with policies that help those people.\n\n(02:21:47)And what have you done? You've led an opportunity for us to have the lower taxes, way lower deregulation, record amounts of investment that's coming into this country. We're going to be seeing lower interest rates. All of those things coming together is a gift to the working people. The policies are lifting everybody up. There's 140 million Americans that get up and go every day and drive to work. They commute. And one of the most obscene things of the prior administration was their energy policies was creating a hidden tax on those people. The poorer you were, usually the further you had to drive because you couldn't afford the housing if you were working at a hotel, if you were working in a service industry. We were taxing them. A hidden tax on them was the high cost of energy. You're perhaps one of the only leaders in the world that understood the connection between peace abroad and prosperity at home was directly connected to energy policy.\n\n(02:22:40)You came in and said, \"We're going to sell energy to our friends and allies. We're going to bring prosperity to home through policies here by having lower energy prices. And we're going to stop funding wars abroad with energy policies that helped our adversaries and hurt us.\" You said, \"We're going to sell energy to our friends and allies.\" And with the work that Jamieson and Howard and Scott and everyone has done on these trade deals, we're going to have an opportunity to have a renaissance in American energy, selling energy to the world, which is going to help bring peace abroad. But the real key thing, in closing, I want to say is two things. One has to do with the US Park Police. That's the group here in Washington, DC. They're the oldest uniform, oldest uniform law enforcement group in the nation. You coming out and visiting with them in person before they went out on the surge, not only are carjackings down, muggings down, homicides down, everything down, morale is through the roof.\n\n(02:23:35)Just like Pete saw, we've got record people signing up to want to be part of our military. You have breathed life back into the profession of law enforcement. Your respect for law enforcement is so incredible. It's making a difference. And then us giving them the tools. On a lighter note for everybody here, one of the rules that, under President Trump, we're able to change for the US Park Police was they could do a pursuit. I was shocked to find out when we were talking to them, like, \"Oh, you pull somebody over and they just drive away and you can't pursue them?\" And they said, \"No, we can't.\" They said, \"Old rules.\" We got that rule changed in 24 hours because of President Trump's leadership. The next night, they had so much fun. They pulled people over. They started to take off. They chased him. They stopped him.\n\n(02:24:16)And then the bad guys, some of these were in cars that had stolen plates. So they'd take the plate off. They steal them off somebody else's car. They know the plate doesn't match. They know they're doing this thing. The bad guys in the car said, \"What? You're not supposed to chase us.\" But you're breaking the rules. The bad guys are telling us [inaudible 02:24:33]. No, no, we're back in action. So the morale is high. They all wanted to say thank you to you. Yesterday, you announced increasing the number of US Park Police that we're going to hire. This is the group that protects not only our sacred monuments of democracy here, but also the Statue of Liberty and the Golden Gate. This is a great group. But on behalf of all law enforcement, we say thank you. And as Chris Wright was talking about electricity, I want to close with that. We've solved amazing things in seven months, but the big challenge we have against the remaining is solving Iran's nuclear thing. That was an existential threat. China beating us in the AI arms race, that's an external threat. We finally have a President who talks about it. You talked about it in your opening remarks. You've signed executive orders. You understand that essentially we used to save … Hundreds of years ago, people started saying that knowledge is power, but now for the first time in history, we can take a electricity and we can convert it into intelligence. So it's flipped. It's no longer knowledge is power. Power is also knowledge.\n\n(02:25:37)And while we're ahead on the technology, we're way behind China on the amount of electricity they're bringing online. And your strong position to support affordable, reliable energy using our nation's resources, including those across the Department of Interior, bringing back coal mining, bringing back mining, bringing back timber. All the industries that have been killed in this country are coming back to life because of you. And with your leadership, we have a chance to not only win the AI arms race, but actually dominate it the way we're dominating in other things. So thank you, Mr. President.\n\nPresident Donald Trump (02:26:07):\n\nThank you very much. And we're leading that race right now by a lot. And we're going to keep the electricity coming. In China, they do it very quickly. They have one person that says, \"Do it,\" and that's it. But essentially, we have one person that says, \"Do it.\" And we've given that order. And the job they've done has been amazing. And I want to thank, again, Lee, what you're doing in that regard is so important. And the rapidity, just as fast as them, because it's a question of a week versus a day. And that's not going to make the difference. But you've done fantastically. And Doug and Chris, amazing job. So we've done this for a little while now. I don't think you've ever seen anything like it. And I think Sean was right. These guys that are holding these up, if you ever try holding your hand out for two hours, that's a long time. These are pretty strong characters. You've been doing that a long time, I guess. Congratulations.\n\nSpeaker 11 (02:27:04):\n\nToo long.\n\nPresident Donald Trump (02:27:04):\n\nAre you getting tired? Are you getting tired?\n\nSpeaker 11 (02:27:07):\n\nWe're good for another 2 hours.\n\nPresident Donald Trump (02:27:08):\n\nI'm looking at these guys. They look like they have no problem. It's amazing, actually. I think they would've beaten you guys in the test. So I want to thank you. If you want … It's been a long time. If you want, we could go in and we can call it a day.\n\nCrowd (02:27:26):\n\nNo. We're-\n\n(02:27:27)No. No. [inaudible 02:27:27].\n\nPresident Donald Trump (02:27:30):\n\nNo? And feel free then to ask some of the questions here. Look, I believe in very open … We want to be open, above board. We want to be honest with the media. I wish the media was totally honest with us, but I think they're getting better, to be honest with you. And so we'll see. But if you want to take a few questions, you really want to do it.\n\nCrowd (02:27:49):\n\nMr. President. Mr. President.\n\nSpeaker 9 (02:27:49):\n\nOn serious note, when it comes to Fed Governor Lisa Cook, her lawyer has said that they're going to be filing a lawsuit challenging this legal action. What is your response when you prepared for a legal fight? And then a little bit [inaudible 02:28:00].\n\nPresident Donald Trump (02:28:00):\n\nOh, sure. Always. You always have legal fights. Look, I had a legal fight that went on for years with crooked people, with very horrible people, people that have been found out now between John Ratcliffe and Tulsi and Pam. And the things that we found out, of course it's a very, very sad group of people. But no, she seems to have had an infraction. And she can't have an infraction, especially that infraction, because she's in charge of, if you think about it, mortgages. And we need people that are 100% above board. And it doesn't seem like she was. Yeah, please.\n\nSpeaker 8 (02:28:34):\n\nMr. President. First, I would love to ask you a serious question, but I have to tell you, the biggest pop culture news of the year broke while we were in this Cabinet meeting. Travis Kelce and Taylor Swift are engaged. And the world wants your reaction, sir.\n\nPresident Donald Trump (02:28:48):\n\nWell, I wish them a lot of luck. No, I think he's a great player. I think he's a great guy. And I think that she's a terrific person. So I wish them a lot of luck.\n\nSpeaker 8 (02:29:02):\n\nOn a serious note, Mr. President, in May, Secretary Rubio said that they were aggressively removing visas of Chinese students. Yesterday, you said you want to allow 600,000 Chinese students to study in the United States. Could you and the Secretary clarify what is the policy on Chinese students in the United States?\n\nPresident Donald Trump (02:29:22):\n\nWell, we think we're … Look, we're getting along very well with China. And I'm getting along very well with President Xi. I think it's very insulting to say students can't come here because they'll go out, they'll start building schools, and they'll be able to survive it. But I like that their students come here. I like that other country's students come here. And you know what would happen if they didn't? Our college system would go to hell very quickly. And it wouldn't be the top colleges. It would be colleges that struggle on the bottom. And you take out 300,000 or 600,000 students out of the system. I like having … And I told this to President Xi, that we're honored to have their students here. Now, with that, we check and we're careful and we see who's there. And Marco wants that. We spoke. We're in the same position, but we have a tremendous college system.\n\n(02:30:12)The best in the world. Nobody even close. That's why China sends them here. And you can call it an industry, if you want, but you're talking about millions of people. And I'm honored to have the students from China come here. We're just getting along very well with China. And it's a different relationship that we had for years where they took hundreds of billions of dollars, just sucked it right out of our country. They respect us again. I respect them. The relationship is very good. I think it's important that these are two very major powers, nuclear powers at that, but two very important powers.\n\n(02:30:50)When I get along with Putin, when I get along with President Xi, when I get along with these people, that's a good thing, not a bad thing. We're tough and we're smart and we're strong. We get along. It's a lot better than not getting along. You had somebody in here before. The war should have never started with Ukraine and Russia. It would've never started. And Putin said that himself. President Putin said that himself. So we want to see college students come in from countries. There are some countries that we can't necessarily say. Places that have ideologies that we can't live with. So there are some areas, some countries that we can't say that. But we're honored to have the students come here. Please.\n\nCrowd (02:31:30):\n\nMr. President.\n\n(02:31:30)Mr. President. [inaudible 02:31:31].\n\nPresident Donald Trump (02:31:30):\n\nYeah, please.\n\nSpeaker 7 (02:31:32):\n\nYesterday, you said that within two to three weeks, we would have a conclusive, pretty good, conclusive end to the war in Gaza. What did you mean by that? And could you [inaudible 02:31:42]-\n\nPresident Donald Trump (02:31:42):\n\nOn what?\n\nSpeaker 7 (02:31:43):\n\nIn the war in Gaza. You said-\n\nPresident Donald Trump (02:31:44):\n\nYeah. What about it?\n\nSpeaker 7 (02:31:45):\n\nYou said in two to three weeks, we would have a conclusive and a pretty [inaudible 02:31:50]-\n\nPresident Donald Trump (02:31:50):\n\nThere's no conclusive. It's been going on for a long time, but you're talking about … I guess if you really add it up, Steve, you're talking about thousands of years. Okay? It's been going on for … There's nothing conclusive, but hopefully we're going to have things solved very quickly with regard to Gaza and also with regard to Ukraine and Russia.\n\nCrowd (02:32:08):\n\nMr. President.\n\n(02:32:08)Mr. President. Russia and Ukraine.\n\n(02:32:10)[inaudible 02:32:10].\n\nSpeaker 10 (02:32:10):\n\nWho are you considering for the replacement to nominate for Lisa Cook? And what economic background or history are you-\n\nPresident Donald Trump (02:32:17):\n\nWell, we have some very good people for that position. And I think we have some very good people. We're down to … I think I maybe in my own mind have somebody that I like, but I deal with Scott and I deal with Howard. And we're dealing with a lot of people actually that are going to be involved in that decision ultimate. It's a very important decision. As we see, I got a bad recommendation when I went with Jerome Too Late. He's too late. His nickname is Too Late. Costing us a lot of money, hurting the housing. Our housing industry is good, but it could be phenomenal. Most of this country, in economic terms, has been phenomenal. We've never seen anything like it. Because of him and his high interest rates, the housing is less than it could be. We're going to get that straightened out very quickly.\n\n(02:33:08)He gets out very quickly, fortunately. He's been the wrong guy. Not a bad person, I don't think. But I do think he has motives, by the way, but I don't consider him. I've dealt with worse, but he hasn't done the job. The recommendation from a certain person was not a great recommendation. That person vouched for him. But we're doing a very careful study. We'll see what happens. Look, we just put a very good man in one position. We might switch him to the other. It's a longer term. And pick somebody else.\n\n(02:33:41)But we're very happy with the person we have in there. And we'll have a majority very shortly. So that'll be great. Once we have a majority, housing is going to swing and it's going to be great. People are paying too high an interest rate. That's the only problem with housing. We have to get the rates down a little bit. And when we do, it's going to be a tremendous difference. The country-\n\nCrowd (02:34:01):\n\n[inaudible 02:34:02].\n\nPresident Donald Trump (02:34:02):\n\nBut the country is doing so well. It sort of blows through the fact that we have a man who's too late and not doing a very good job. Please, in blue.\n\nSpeaker 12 (02:34:12):\n\nMr. President, regarding crime in DC, something that might help, especially ladies, is being able to carry. I know you talked about reciprocal carry. Would you like for that to apply here in Washington, DC?\n\nPresident Donald Trump (02:34:22):\n\nWhen you say carry, I assume you're talking about carry … What we're talking about, right?\n\nSpeaker 12 (02:34:27):\n\nConcealed or … Yeah.\n\nPresident Donald Trump (02:34:27):\n\nIn other words, carry a gun. Is that right? Would you like to carry a gun?\n\nSpeaker 12 (02:34:31):\n\nI would like to. Yes, sir.\n\nPresident Donald Trump (02:34:32):\n\nYou'd feel a hell of a lot better, right?\n\nSpeaker 12 (02:34:33):\n\nI absolutely.\n\nPresident Donald Trump (02:34:34):\n\nI agree with you 100%. Okay?\n\nSpeaker 12 (02:34:35):\n\nOkay. Great.\n\nPresident Donald Trump (02:34:37):\n\nBut I'll tell you, within another couple of weeks, it's hard to believe what's been accomplished in 12 days, but within another couple of weeks, you won't have to carry. You're not going to have to carry.\n\nSpeaker 12 (02:34:48):\n\n[inaudible 02:34:49].\n\nPresident Donald Trump (02:34:49):\n\nYou're going to be safe. People are safe now. The turn has gone fast. I knew it was going to go fast, but this turn has gone really fast. And within a month or two, this is going to be one of the safest places in the country. I have no doubt about it. And we'll do an extension. We'll work with Congress. Or I could declare an emergency, but I don't think that's going to be necessary. We'll work with Congress.\n\nSpeaker 12 (02:35:12):\n\nAnd to that, we've got-\n\nPresident Donald Trump (02:35:13):\n\nWe're going to be working with Congress. I spoke with our great speaker. And I will be speaking to John Thune. And we're getting tremendous support from Congress, especially maybe here. Everybody wants to see our capital be great. You could say be great again. It's such a beautiful place. But if you have crime, nothing looks beautiful. But you won't need to carry a gun. But if you do, going to be your choice.\n\nSpeaker 12 (02:35:38):\n\nWell, I would like to have the option. Just in case.\n\nPresident Donald Trump (02:35:41):\n\nWell, a lot of people feel that.\n\nSpeaker 12 (02:35:42):\n\nAlso, in other blue cities, you've got Karen Bass in Los Angeles, Brandon Johnson in Chicago, it seems to be very popular here, the fact that people can walk around, go to restaurants, shop [inaudible 02:35:53] to worry about their safety. If blue city Mayors oppose those efforts in their cities, do you anticipate that Democrat voters are going to take it all and then [inaudible 02:36:01]?\n\nPresident Donald Trump (02:36:01):\n\nI think so. I think that crime is going to be a big thing. And we are the party. The Republicans are the party that wants to stop crime. We're against crime. The Democrats like crime. I don't know why. We talk about common sense. I think I got elected on talking about common sense. The border. We have to have a wall. We don't want transgender for everybody. As I said before, we don't want to have men playing in women's sports. You see the difference. Weightlifting. Take a look at weightlifting. Take a look at long-distance running where a runner came in five hours and 14 minutes ahead of another runner. Both champions, one male, one … It's not fair. It's demeaning to women. It's so bad. But they have another one. And I think this is the beauty of them all. Crime.\n\n(02:36:51)They're against crime prevention. You can't do that. You can't do that. And I think to myself, I say, \"Is there some game?\" They're smart people. Anybody that could cheat like that in elections is smart. Okay? And there's never been in history anybody that could cheat like that. They're smart. They're brilliant in many ways. I say, \"Is there some trick to this?\" When they say, \"Trump is in Washington, DC, stopping crime. He's a dictator.\" And people are being mugged, like your brilliant associate here. I don't know how you're alive. Based on that story, you got very lucky he didn't just go … All he had do is this, right?\n\nSpeaker 13 (02:37:34):\n\nExactly.\n\nPresident Donald Trump (02:37:35):\n\nAnd it's pretty amazing.\n\nSpeaker 13 (02:37:37):\n\nWas it intentional?\n\nPresident Donald Trump (02:37:38):\n\nSo we have something. I think we have two things. I think what Bobby was talking about with respect to drug prices is unbeatable. Nobody else could have done it but us. And I think that crime. I think crime will be the big subject of the midterms and will be the big subject of the next election. Think of it. Instead of saying, \"Trump's right about crime,\" it's really bad in Chicago. You have a guy in Illinois, the governor of Illinois, saying that crime has been much better in Chicago recently, and Trump is a dictator. And most people say, \"If you call him a dictator, then … If he stops crime, he can be whatever he wants.\" I'm not a dictator, by the way. But he can be whatever he wants. I think it's going to be a big, big subject for the midterms. And I think the Republicans are going to do really well. They called it a trap. This Democrat consultant, they said, \"He's put them in a trap again,\" because these are all traps. 80/20, but they're not 80/20. They're almost 100 to nothing. All these issues.\n\n(02:38:50)But I would say that crime is stronger than men playing in women's sports. I think it's stronger than transgender for everybody. It's transgender for everybody, according to them. It's stronger. Of course, this is the cause of it. Open borders. Open borders gave us a lot of this crime. So they're sort of on an equal footing, I guess. But crime is going to be a very big subject. And you know what he should do if he was smart? Illinois or New York, if they want, or Gavin Newsom, they should call me and they should say, \"We've got a problem.\" We could solve, with this team … Different players, but worked the same way because you'd leave them here. You don't want to take them out and let it go to hell. Everybody's so happy. And I bet you walked over here today and you had no fear.\n\n(02:39:40)Nobody has any fear anymore for the last 12 days. It would be so smart. Gavin Newsom, call me up, say, \"You know what? We have a big problem. We have the Olympics coming up. We want to do well. We have tremendous problems on crime and other things and would love some help.\" Chicago, in particular, maybe right now. It's a disaster. It's a disaster. We could solve their problem in … It's bigger than this. Let's say two months. Okay. Working with their police. I know their police very well. I have a big project in Chicago. I was so proud of it. It's the best site in Chicago. I got it. Nobody else got it. I was happy as … That was when I was a real estate guy. And I got it. The Sun Time Site, they call it. And I built a building.\n\n(02:40:27)It's a great building. And I'm so embarrassed when I see the kind of crime stats coming out there. So embarrassed. And if I were a governor, a Democrat governor or mayor or anybody having to do … I'd call up President Trump. I'd say, \"President Trump, we need your help. We saw what you've done in DC in a period of 12 days.\" This is 12 days. We haven't even started. This is going to be so safe, going to be the safest place on earth. And we'll do the same thing in Chicago. But I'd like to be asked as opposed to just going in and doing it. Because when you go in and do it, then they start screaming, \"Oh, he shouldn't be here. We don't need him. We're doing so well.\" And then the better we do, they take credit for it. So it's really pretty unfair.\n\nCrowd (02:41:12):\n\nMr. President.\n\n(02:41:12)Mr. President.\n\nPresident Donald Trump (02:41:12):\n\nYes. Go ahead.\n\nSpeaker 13 (02:41:13):\n\nMr. President, on crime, for a lot of victims, like myself, a big concern is long-term sustainability. Can you share more with the American public about your plan in ensuring that DC is safe in a long-term [inaudible 02:41:25]?\n\nPresident Donald Trump (02:41:24):\n\nLonger term. Yeah. Well, it's a great question. Number one, we want to stay there for longer than 30 days. As you know, we have an absolute mandate. And I can extend it, but I'd rather not have to declare a national emergency because by that time … Right now, there's not an emergency. As you sort of said yourself, it feels like a different world. We've got under arrest and prosecution and we've thrown out … Taken some, and we're in the process of taking hundreds out of our country that shouldn't be here. And these are hardcore professional criminals. They were born to be criminals, in my opinion, but they're seriously bad people. Murderers, drug dealers, you know them all. You see them all as you walk beautifully to work. And every once in a while, somebody puts a gun to your head because that's what happened in your case.\n\n(02:42:14)We're getting a lot of them out of the country. We're putting a lot of them in prison because we're afraid to bring them out of the country. They could come back. As good as we're doing, they could come back. We don't want them back. And that's going to solve a lot of it. We also think there should be a presence here for long enough. We should also work with our police department because you have very good police here. Very good. We're working very well with them, by the way. And we have to work together for a while. We have some people that are very tough and very strong working with the police. They're going to be able to handle it. And you know what? If it gets a little bit bad, a little bit, just a little bit, I'll bring them back in and we'll straighten it out.\n\n(02:42:51)We'll make it perfect. You're going to be so safe in this city. And you're going to have the city beautified. We're going to be giving out … We're working with Clark, as you know, Construction. They're the biggest. They're working with me. Also, we're building a beautiful ballroom for the White House. They've been after it for 150 years. Employs a lot of people. It's going to be as beautiful a ballroom as has ever been built. And Clark is the big builder in this city. They've done, I guess, a majority of the good work, the big work. And we're working with them on the beautification, the fixing up the roads, the fixing up of the medians between the roads so cars don't wrap into each other. They wrap into … I have one piece sitting on the ground for weeks. This was a year ago when I had to come in, unfortunately, for fake court cases. And I looked at the condition. We have it fixed up a lot right now.\n\n(02:43:45)The tents are removed and a lot of things have taken place. But I'd come into this city and I say, \"Boy, does it look bad?\" The filth on the roads. The medians were broken and always laying down and nobody would fix them and all of that. Well, we're going to have new medians. We're going to have a nice topping put on the road. We're not going to rip the roads apart and start a construction project that last for two and a half years as they rebuild the road, which they don't have to do. And we're going to have this place so beautiful. It's going to be a part of it. Now, the biggest part is crime, but it's also a part … when you see a dirty city, it's like I told … I don't know. It became the number one thing. \"Viral,\" I said. My father, he's a smart guy.\n\n(02:44:26)He's a great guy. He's a loving, wonderful father. But he could be a little on the tough side. He told me that, \"Son, when you walk into a restaurant and you see a dirty, filthy door going into the restaurant, don't go there because the kitchen's dirty also.\" When they see a dirty capital, the rest of the world, they lose a lot of respect for our country. This capital is going to be so beautiful. We're going to have new poles, new lights, new fences. It's stuff that when you add it up, it's money, but it's peanuts compared to what we're talking about. And we're also going to have great safety.\n\nSpeaker 14 (02:44:59):\n\nMr. President.\n\nPresident Donald Trump (02:45:00):\n\n… safety.\n\nSpeaker 14 (02:45:00):\n\nMr. President, I wanted to ask you on crime and also a question on foreign policy that maybe other officials can weigh into. And on crime, Iris shared her story and you mentioned a lot of people going to dinner.\n\nPresident Donald Trump (02:45:13):\n\nIt was a terrible story. I'm just amazed she's here. Pam, when the gun is put to the head. Did they ever capture these people by the way?\n\nSpeaker 15 (02:45:23):\n\nI kept calling but asking her back about this, discuss,\n\nPresident Donald Trump (02:45:25):\n\nIt'd be really great if you could maybe give the information. She's very good at capturing people. She's very good. If you could give that information to Pam would be great. Would you do that?\n\nSpeaker 15 (02:45:39):\n\nYes, I would. Thank you so much.\n\nPresident Donald Trump (02:45:39):\n\nAll right. I would assume you'd like to see them captured.\n\nSpeaker 15 (02:45:42):\n\nFor sure.\n\nPresident Donald Trump (02:45:42):\n\nYou just can't-\n\nSpeaker 15 (02:45:43):\n\nIt's over three years.\n\nPresident Donald Trump (02:45:44):\n\nYeah, take a good look at that. Go ahead. So go ahead.\n\nSpeaker 14 (02:45:47):\n\nJust a few weeks ago I was out to dinner with my husband and then we're taking the metro back and then we get attacked in the metro. They're throwing things, some teenagers throwing liquid at us.\n\nPresident Donald Trump (02:45:57):\n\nOh, they're throwing things? How about where they chop down the granite curbs and the concrete curbs, but the granite curbs so expensive. Those granite curbs, nobody uses them because they're so expensive, and you see a guy chopping them and handing out big chunks of them like a brick because they couldn't get in because people were stopping them from walking out. A little bit unusual when you're walking with a bag of bricks. Generally speaking, Sean, that's not a good sign, right? It's not a good sign. But they now come in with hammers. They can disguise a hammer and they start pounding the concrete and the granite and they hand out chunks, and those people take those chunks and start throwing at cops or they stand on the top of bridges and they drop them down into the windshield of your car and you get killed running into a light pole. Those days are over.\n\nSpeaker 14 (02:46:46):\n\nI wanted to ask you, Governor Hochul, Kathy Hochul, said that she spoke to you on the phone and you said you might send National Guard troops to New York. You've mentioned that, so will you be sending?\n\nPresident Donald Trump (02:46:57):\n\nI'd love to do it if she'd like. I get along with Kathy. If she'd like to do that, I would do it. See, look, New York has difficulty and I don't want to make this bite, I want to make this like friendly, but the places we're talking about happen to be virtually all Democrat run. Now, take a look at your 25 places that are most troubled, everyone except maybe one and it's way back in number 24 or 25, but essentially 25 out of 25 are run by Democrats and cashless bail was a disaster when they did that, and I believe it was instituted first in New York. But when they did cashless bail, that was a tragedy for this because that's when it really started. It really started getting bad.\n\n(02:47:44)When somebody killed somebody, you don't say, \"You can come out, you don't have to put up anything.\" You put that person in jail and you find out whether or not it's true, but you don't give cashless bail with a promise to, \"Come back in a couple of months, we'll start talking to you.\" Because they go out and they kill other people and you can't do that. The cashless bail, it's just a woke thing. It's got to stop. You see that Christie better than anybody. It's got to stop. It causes unbelievable, and we're doing that. We're stopping it in D.C. I would love to have the governor of Illinois call me and say, \"Look, we have a problem in Chicago.\" We will stop that problem in Chicago in two months, maybe less, two months, we'll stop it. These are tough cookies we have working for us. These are tough cookies. These are not politically correct soldiers, that I won't go into definitions of what that means, but these are not politically correct soldiers. These are rough guys.\n\n(02:48:44)I watched it last night. I see it. I saw them the other day when we went down and we spent some time together with them. These are tough cookies. These are not people that you're going to laugh at and spit in their face and they're not going to do anything about it. And these people, they're afraid. These gang members who are bad people too. These are just bad people. Ours are bad, but they're bad in a good sense, right? You understand that, Scott. And we can solve Chicago in two months. Now, then as per your statement before, we have to keep it going and we'll be able to keep it going.\n\n(02:49:18)The first thing you have to do is get it down. We are very close to being in that position in D.C., and within a month from when we started, which is quicker than I thought, we're, you're going to feel very, very safe. I think you feel very safe right now.\n\nSpeaker 16 (02:49:35):\n\nMr. President.\n\nPresident Donald Trump (02:49:36):\n\nBut I would love it to have these governors, mayors, call me and say, \"We'd like to invite you into our community because we have a problem and you can handle the problem and we can't.\" One other thing, sanctuary cities, they should be terminated. They're sanctuary for criminals. They're safety and security for criminals. They are very, very bad and all of these places have big sanctuary cities and all they're doing is protecting criminals. Okay.\n\nSpeaker 16 (02:50:03):\n\nMr. President.\n\nPresident Donald Trump (02:50:03):\n\nGo ahead.\n\nSpeaker 16 (02:50:06):\n\nAbout Lisa Cook, you have spoken out very strongly for a long time about what you see as the weaponization of government. Is your administration weaponizing-\n\nPresident Donald Trump (02:50:15):\n\nNo.\n\nSpeaker 16 (02:50:16):\n\n… government by digging into the mortgage records of officials you don't like?\n\nPresident Donald Trump (02:50:20):\n\nNo. They're public. I mean, you can find out those records. You can go check out the records yourself and you should be doing that job. Actually, you wouldn't do that because that's not the kind of reporter you are, but you should be doing that job. I shouldn't have to be doing it. If you did your job properly, we wouldn't have problems like Lisa Cook. Go ahead. You were going to say something. Belle? Blue?\n\nSpeaker 16 (02:50:37):\n\nSo we will be trying to fire-\n\nSpeaker 17 (02:50:37):\n\nMr. President-\n\nSpeaker 16 (02:50:37):\n\n… [inaudible 02:50:42] to lower interest rates?\n\nSpeaker 17 (02:50:42):\n\n… on national security.\n\nPresident Donald Trump (02:50:43):\n\nI think we have to have lower interest rates. Yes.\n\nSpeaker 17 (02:50:45):\n\nA follow-up question for you and Madame Attorney General on national security. We've heard from Stephen Miller yesterday in the Oval Office that there are street criminals here in D.C., who are actually found to be doing business with transnational criminal cartels overseas.\n\nPresident Donald Trump (02:50:59):\n\nAnd we know who they are and we know who they're doing business with, and we're arresting the people, very strongly arresting, and we're keeping them there because your laws here make it very difficult. And one of the other laws we're trying to get done, because you 14-year-old kids that are just as tough as a 25-five-year-old kid, just as dangerous and they carry the same gun, and we have to make a provision where they're treated like older people because these are seriously tough, bad, they're children, but they're criminals and they're really bad criminals. And they're used by older people because they never get charged because you can't do anything to them. But we are getting that changed, Pam, I hope. Because you have 14-year-old kids that are evil, they're sick, and they have to be put away, that something has to be done. You can't have a society where they're allowed to walk the street. You know that better than anybody.\n\nSpeaker 18 (02:51:54):\n\nMr. President, on your way to Alaska-\n\nPresident Donald Trump (02:51:57):\n\nI can't believe it, you're not tired holding that? Look at this.\n\nSpeaker 18 (02:52:00):\n\nI have a few more questions.\n\nPresident Donald Trump (02:52:01):\n\nHow strong are you? Look at him. He's been holding that thing for three hours. You're a good fisherman.\n\nSpeaker 18 (02:52:07):\n\nThanks a lot [inaudible 02:52:09].\n\nPresident Donald Trump (02:52:09):\n\nGo ahead.\n\nSpeaker 18 (02:52:10):\n\nOn Alaska, you had mentioned that there would be severe consequences if Vladimir Putin did not agree to a ceasefire.\n\nPresident Donald Trump (02:52:14):\n\nYeah.\n\nSpeaker 18 (02:52:14):\n\nAfter that summit, that was rolled back given the negotiations. Is he back on the clock now?\n\nPresident Donald Trump (02:52:22):\n\nI want to see that deal end. It's very serious what I have in mind if I have to do it, but I want to see it end. I think that in many ways he's there. Sometimes he'll be there and Zelenskyy won't be there. It's like, who do we have today? I got to get them both at the same time. But I want to have it end. We have economic sanctions. I'm talking about economic, because we're not going to get into a World War.\n\n(02:52:52)I'll tell you what, in my opinion, if I didn't win this race, Ukraine could have ended up in a World War. We're not going to end up in a World War anymore, but it would've ended up possibly in a World War. They were ready to trot. But just like India and Pakistan were going to end up in a nuclear war if I didn't stop them. It was sort of strange. I saw they were fighting, then I saw seven jets were shot down. I said, that's not good. That's a lot of jets. $150 million planes were shot down. A lot of them. Seven, maybe more than that. They didn't even report the real number. And I'm talking to a very terrific man, Modi of India, and I say, \"What's going on with you and Pakistan?\" Then I'm talking to Pakistan on trade. I said, \"What's going on with you and India?\" And the hatred was tremendous.\n\n(02:53:51)Now, this has been going on for a hell of a long time, sometimes with different names, for hundreds of years. But I said, \"What's going on?\" I said, \"I don't want to make a trade deal.\" \"No, no, no, we want to make trade deal.\" I said, \"No, no, I don't want to make a trade deal with you. You're going to have a nuclear war. You guys are going to end up in a nuclear war.\" And that was very important to them. I said, \"Call me back tomorrow, but we're not going to do any deals with you. Or we're going to put tariffs on you that are so high.\" You were there Howard, right?\n\nHoward (02:54:23):\n\nYep.\n\nPresident Donald Trump (02:54:23):\n\nYou're going to put tariffs on you that was so high, I don't give a damn, your head's going to spin. You're not going to end up in a war. Within about five hours, it was done. It was done. Now, maybe it starts again. I don't know. I don't think so, but I'll stop it if it does. We can't let these things happen. The Russia-Ukraine situation. Last week, 7,012 soldiers, 7,000, 0-12 soldiers died. They were Russian, they were Ukrainian, they weren't American. So a lot of people would say, what do you care? They're not American. I care. Over the last couple of weeks, over 12,000 people died in two weeks. We're talking about crime where somebody's killed here. Think of it, you have your son leaving Russia, leaving Ukraine, their little house, wherever they live with their parents, they're waving goodbye, just like our parents would wave goodbye and they're waving goodbye son. And then a week later, his head's blown off in a stupid war by a drone. A whole new form of military problem.\n\n(02:55:34)So no, I'd like it to stop. I want to get it to stop and it will not be a World War, but it'll be an economic war. And an economic war is going to be bad and it's going to be bad for Russia and I don't want that. Now I have to also see, because not everybody, Zelenskyy is not exactly innocent either. It takes two people to tango and I say it all the time, you got to get them together. I get along with Zelenskyy now, but we have a much different relationship because now we're not paying any money to Ukraine. I stopped that. We're paying money to ourselves. What's happening is NATO is buying all of the equipment and paying in full.\n\n(02:56:20)But even with that, forget about that. I want to get it stop because it's a lot of lives that are being lost. Every week it's 7,000, 5,000, six. I get the reports and I see battlefields. I'd rather not see them. And you read about Gettysburg and you see those thousand, 600,000 people, but in that war in particular was really bad. Like 150,000 or something. Just dead body. I'm seeing the same. I see pictures, I see satellite pictures of heads over here, arms over here, legs over here. And this is like a modern age. It's no different than the worst wars that I've ever seen. And if I can stop it because I have a certain power or a certain relationship, I had a very good relationship with President Putin. Very, very good. That's a positive thing. Steve Witkoff would tell you I'm the only one that can solve it. I don't know. He's told me that a few times. Unless he was saying that just to build up my ego, but it's not really. I have no ego when it comes to this stuff. I just want to see it stop. Thousands of young people, mostly young people are dying every single week. If I can save that by doing sanctions or by just being me or by using a very strong tariff system that's very costly to Russia or Ukraine or whoever we have. But I stopped seven wars and three of those wars were going on for more than 30 years. If you look at Congo, if you just look at any of them, almost all of them were going on for extended period of time. Now interestingly, one had just started, it was two days old and you know that one. That we did that one when we were in Scotland negotiating, it was two days, but there were 2000 dead bodies laying on the border, and I got that one stopped too. And I'm very honored by that. The one that I thought would be the easiest is turning out to be the hardest. That's President Putin and President Zelenskyy, but I think I'll get it done.\n\nSpeaker 19 (02:58:30):\n\nWhy do you think [inaudible 02:58:33]?\n\nPresident Donald Trump (02:58:33):\n\nYou never know, it's war.\n\nSpeaker 16 (02:58:34):\n\nCan you stop the-\n\nPresident Donald Trump (02:58:35):\n\nWith war, you never know, right?\n\nSpeaker 16 (02:58:37):\n\nSir.\n\nPresident Donald Trump (02:58:37):\n\nWar's very tricky, very horrible. But with war, you never know. Things change. People go into war, think they're going to win the war, and then they get their asses kicked and they lose their country and they lose millions of lives. Nobody goes into a war thinking they're going to lose. I'm sure that Ukraine thought they were going to win, \"We're going to win.\" You're going to beat somebody that's 15 times your size? Biden shouldn't have let that happen. Biden shouldn't have… I mean, the man was grossly incompetent. He should have never been there. That would've never happened. But you don't go into a war that's 15 times your size.\n\nSpeaker 16 (02:59:13):\n\nDo you think-\n\nPresident Donald Trump (02:59:16):\n\nSay it?\n\nSpeaker 16 (02:59:16):\n\n[inaudible 02:59:17] just put out a statement saying that Lisa Cook has indicated through a personal attorney that she'll promptly challenge, actually in court, seek a judicial decision that would confirm her ability to continue.\n\nPresident Donald Trump (02:59:29):\n\nThat's all right. Whatever it is.\n\nSpeaker 16 (02:59:31):\n\nShe says the Fed will abide by any court decision.\n\nPresident Donald Trump (02:59:32):\n\nThank you very much, Irina.\n\nSpeaker 16 (02:59:36):\n\nWill you abide by a court decision.\n\nPresident Donald Trump (02:59:37):\n\nI abide by the court. Yeah, I abide by the court. Yes, please. That's enough. That's enough.\n\nSpeaker 20 (02:59:39):\n\nMr. President-\n\nPresident Donald Trump (02:59:39):\n\nGo ahead.\n\nSpeaker 20 (02:59:42):\n\n… what other companies are you thinking about taking stake in?\n\nPresident Donald Trump (02:59:46):\n\nWell, we didn't take a stake in the sense that it was reported. Everyone said, I bought a stake in Intel. No, I got it for free. I said, I was with the… Is that correct statement? Howard was there.\n\nHoward (02:59:57):\n\nAbsolutely correct.\n\nPresident Donald Trump (02:59:58):\n\nScott knew all about it. They came in, a man was charged with something by a very good person. Senator Cotton made some statements about the gentleman that was running Intel. When he came in, and I said some rough things about him. I said, \"I'm not happy with it.\" And they called and he was very devastated at what I said. I said, \"You should immediately resign.\" And he came to see me and I was very impressed by him actually. And he made a mistake, or factors happened where something like this could have taken place. In the meantime, his board was staying by him. And I said to him and took about, I would say less than 45 seconds, I said, \"You know what you should do if you're smart, give the United States of America 10% of your company.\" And he looked at me and he said, \"I'll do that.\" I said, \"I just made $11 billion for the United States.\" And we made the deal. I didn't pay, we didn't write a check.\n\n(03:01:04)Now, I guess Biden with his stupid Chips Act handed money to all these people that didn't need any money. It didn't do anything. They're giving billions of dollars to everybody. They all have so much money and they have more money, but there's no commitment that you had to build. They just took all this money. It's the stupidest thing I've ever seen. See, with tariffs. They have to come in because if they don't come in, they can't sell into our country. So it's power. And you don't have to give up any money. But I said to him very simply… I mean, I'm glad we're straightening this out because everyone thinks I bought in. No. I said, \"It would be great. We'd be a great partner for you company.\"\n\n(03:01:40)And I want to see Intel do well. Intel was a great company and it can be a great company again, but I said, \"I think it would be good if we own 10% of your company.\" He said, \"I'll make that deal.\" And it happens to be worth $11 billion. So we made 11 billion for the country, and then I was criticized by some of the fake news media. \"That's not the American way.\" Actually, it is the American way. Now, if I can help other countries or do those deals with other, I would do that. I think it's great.\n\nSpeaker 20 (03:02:12):\n\nDo you have other plans?\n\nPresident Donald Trump (03:02:12):\n\nIt builds up our balance sheet. Let me tell you, our country is becoming very rich again. You don't see it. When the CBO came out on Friday and said, \"We just found $4 trillion and that goes to reduce our deficit.\" Four trillion, and it was from the tariffs. Our country's becoming very, very rich again, I hope you get used to it. You're going to have to get used to it.\n\nSpeaker 21 (03:02:41):\n\nOn Congress, they're saying the deficit. Any update on your previous talking about potentially giving Americans a tariff rebate check [inaudible 03:02:50]?\n\nPresident Donald Trump (03:02:49):\n\nWell, we have a lot of money coming in, rebate check for the Americans, and it's coming in at tremendous numbers. Don't forget, I would say, Scott, we probably are talking about right now, 50%, maybe even less than that. With all the money you're hearing is coming in, you're talking about a lot of it hasn't kicked in yet, and when it really kicks in is in two years when these plants are built and opened and the money starts pouring in. But I mean, there's a concept of making a, you could call it a dividend as we would say, making a dividend to the people in this country who have had to suffer through stupid leadership and they paid a lot of taxes and they got nothing for it, or they got attacked like you were for it. Now, there's a possibility. Primarily we want to pay down debt, but there's a possibility that we take a piece of it and him make a dividend to the people.\n\nSpeaker 22 (03:03:47):\n\nMr. President, I have a question for Steve Witkoff if I may.\n\nPresident Donald Trump (03:03:50):\n\nYeah.\n\nSpeaker 22 (03:03:53):\n\nThis past weekend, Sergey Lavrov was saying that Putin will not sign a peace deal with Zelenskyy because Russia views him as illegitimate. I'm just wondering if the Russians had been relaying this to your team? If they've used Zelenskyy as a leader worth signing a peace deal with, if they will go take a-\n\nPresident Donald Trump (03:04:11):\n\nDoesn't matter what they say. Steve can answer, but I can answer it too. Doesn't matter what they say. Everybody's posturing. It's all bullshit, okay? Everybody's posturing. Steve, do you have a different answer?\n\nSteve (03:04:21):\n\nI agree with you, sir.\n\nSpeaker 23 (03:04:26):\n\nPresident Trump, what is your administration here-\n\nSpeaker 24 (03:04:28):\n\nListen, we're 500 people short on the Metropolitan Police. In New York City, it's 3000. In Chicago, it's 1300. Where they have had to bring in troops from the National Guard. If the police departments in this country were fully staffed, defund the police? How bad did that turn out for America?\n\nPresident Donald Trump (03:04:45):\n\nIt's an interesting question. I was surprised when I heard how many police were here. It's not a really big area, and I think they said they're down to 3,200 police or something like that. I said, \"That's a lot of police.\" And I was a little bit surprised because to me that's a big force and it's not a big area, but it is what it is. There's a lot of crime. Don't forget, you have a lot of police that weren't allowed to do their job.\n\nSpeaker 24 (03:05:14):\n\nSure.\n\nPresident Donald Trump (03:05:14):\n\nWhen I came in, as you remember, we made tremendous strides and a little conflict that we had going at the time, because I allowed our military to make the decision. I said, \"You can make any decision you want.\" I gave it to the colonels in the field. I gave it to the captains in the field. You remember that? Where everything went through Biden, meaning one of the people. And everything went through Obama before him. Everything went through. They had to make the decision as to whether or not to attack the Taliban.\n\n(03:05:49)So they'd find 30 people together. They'd call up Washington and they'd go to a political hack who knew nothing about it. My first night I got that same call. They called me and they said… I get a call 3:00 in the morning because I listened to their system, and they were calling me and they were asking me whether or not they could attack a group of people having to do with what war I'm talking about. And I said, \"I know nothing about this. Wait a minute.\" And then I said, \"Who is he? Let me speak to the people calling.\" They're calling from Afghanistan. And I said, \"Let me speak to the people. I want to speak to them.\" And it was a colonel. I said, \"Where'd you go to school, Colonel?\" \"I went to West Point, sir.\" \"Were you a good student?\" \"I was, sir. I was a very good student.\"\n\n(03:06:37)\"So you're calling the White House to ask for permission to attack. And by the time you get the answer,\" how long does it take? Sometimes two or three weeks. \"So by the time you get the answer, the people that you want to attack have already left, right?\" He said, \"How did you know that, sir?\" I said, \"Let me ask you. So you're a good student, you went to West Point and you love the military, right?\" \"Yeah.\" \"You make the decision.\" And I gave all those guys that went to all these great schools, and they're all military people, I gave them the right to make their own decision. And we kicked ISIS' ass. Don't forget, ISIS was supposed to take five years to terminate him. And we had a man named Raisin Cain, who happens to have done the whole thing in Iran, it's a great general, and he's a wonderful guy too, believe it or not, but he's a great soldier. We let them do their work and we defeated ISIS. We defeated everybody.\n\n(03:07:38)Every fight that we had militarily that I had, I won. And I let these great soldiers… Do some make a mistake? I guess. But like this Colonel, I'll never forget it. \"Where did you go to school?\" \"I went to West Point, sir.\" I did ask him a question. I like good students as opposed to bad student. He said, \"I was a good student, sir.\" And I said, \"You do what's necessary.\" And I don't want to sound overly vicious, but he wiped out the entire group of very bad people that want to kill us. So you have to let them do their job. In Washington, they're not allowed to do their job. Okay? They're not allowed. You have great police. You have great police, but they're not allowed… Hello. Go ahead.\n\nSpeaker 25 (03:08:20):\n\nOn congress, Mr. President, would you be open to a year-long continuing resolution?\n\nPresident Donald Trump (03:08:28):\n\nI'm always open to whatever's necessary. Here's the problem in Congress, you have Democrats that will never vote for anything. I could say that we're going to lower your taxes by 50%. We're going to guarantee you free cities, safe cities. Nobody will ever get touched, molested, beat up, shot in the head. We're going to give you the greatest country ever. We need your vote. And they won't vote. And they do it in unison. The only thing they do good is cheat on elections and unite. You know why they unite? Not because they're good or they're loyal people. They unite because they're afraid. They're afraid of the radical left and you can't get their vote.\n\n(03:09:13)So we have a vote coming up at the end of September, and I think we're going to pass it because we have the majority, and I think almost every Republican will vote for an extension, because no matter what deal you make with these people, look at Schumer. He made a deal a year and a half ago and after making the deal, he's been almost run out of the party. He's not the same man. He's not the same man. He's finished. He aged 20 years. He's become a Palestinian, by the way. We call him our great Palestinian senator, but Chuck Schumer, and I wrote him a letter. I said, \"Chuck, that was really great. Thank you very much.\" And somebody gave the letter to the press, not me. And he was destroyed because they thought I was being sarcastic and I wasn't. He made a great decision. It kept our country open. That was a positive. But you can count on almost no vote.\n\n(03:10:07)I mean, I see things. I'll give you an example of crime. So we're going to pass a bill to stop crime. We may not get one Democrat vote. We may not get one. So when you say continuing resolution, I guess so. And it's going to be passed exclusively by Republicans.\n\nSpeaker 26 (03:10:24):\n\nOn farm Visas you mentioned in Iowa that you wanted to see some changes to the H-2A visa program for farm workers.\n\nPresident Donald Trump (03:10:32):\n\nRight.\n\nSpeaker 26 (03:10:33):\n\nYou mentioned in Iowa that you want to see changes. Do you want to see that before the fall harvest?\n\nPresident Donald Trump (03:10:38):\n\nWell, I love both groups and we take care of our farmers and we also take care of the people that want bad people out of our country. And we're working on something that's going to work really well. We take care of our farmers, but we also have to take care of those people that voted for me because they don't want criminals in our country and we're working on something where we can take care of both.\n\nSpeaker 27 (03:10:57):\n\nMr. President, you were talking about the CBO report that two of your Cabinet members were talking about. I remember back on Liberation Day, many of us reporters covered your detractors. People saying that it was going to explode the deficit and therefore it explode the debt. Who all has called you to say I was wrong?\n\nPresident Donald Trump (03:11:14):\n\nThat's very good. You know the answer to that. Okay. Yeah, please go ahead.\n\nSpeaker 28 (03:11:22):\n\nMr. President, governor Pritzker said yesterday at a press conference that he would encourage nonviolent resistance to the National Guard if they were sent to Chicago. What's your response to that?\n\nPresident Donald Trump (03:11:32):\n\nHe said what?\n\nSpeaker 28 (03:11:32):\n\nThat he would encourage nonviolent resistance if the National Guard is sent to Chicago.\n\nPresident Donald Trump (03:11:38):\n\nLook, this guy doesn't know what resistance is or nonviolent resistance is. He's a bad politician. It's amazing. I mean, if he didn't have the money, he wouldn't get any votes. There's no compelling reason to vote for him. Guy's a major loser. But it would be nice if he would call me, I would change my mind immediately. Because everybody knows Chicago is a hellhole right now. Everybody knows it. He's saying, \"Chicago has much better numbers.\" Well, what's much better? You mean 100 people are going to be murdered? It's going to be much more than that. So I would have much more respect for Pritzker if he'd call me up and say, \"I have a problem. Can you help me fix it?\" I would be so happy to do it.\n\n(03:12:19)Not that I don't have the right to do anything I want to do. I'm the President of the United States. If I think our country's in danger, and it is in danger in these cities, I can do it. No problem going in and solving his difficulties. But it would be nice if they'd call and they say, \"Would you do it?\" And we do it in conjunction. Now, we work very well with the police because we naturally get along with the police. So the police and us work really well together. Whether the mayor is oppose. I mean, you have a really rotten mayor there too. He's got a 6% approval rating in Chicago. And I see Black women wearing a red MAGA hat last night on television. \" Please let the President come in. My son was attacked.\" You have a force of Black women, Black women, they're like only Trump. They want Trump to come in and you see them, they're all over the place in Chicago because they're afraid to go out and they don't want their son or their daughter killed. Just like your parents didn't want you killed.\n\n(03:13:29)Look, it's not about winning elections because we want to have nice fair elections. It's not politics. We want to see a safe country. You have people that want to see a safe country and they're great people. You have great people in Chicago. The mayor is at 6% approval. He's an incompetent man. He should have never been put in a position like that. He can't handle it. You have an incompetent governor there. You have an incompetent governor in California, Gavin. I know him very well. He's incompetent. He's a nice guy. Looks good. \"Hi everybody. How you doing?\" He's got some strange hand action going. I don't know what the hell his problem is. It's a little weird, to be honest. A little something shaky going on there.\n\n(03:14:12)But all he has to do is call me and say, \"We have the Olympics coming up. We want to make it really good and safe.\" And I'll put some really good great American patriots in there and you won't have any problems. Don't forget, it's loaded up with some stone-cold killers, some really bad people. Some people that were just born to be bad. They're criminals. Bad criminals. Dangerous. And we can solve the problem for them very quickly.\n\n(03:14:40)You know what I think? I think this. You have not had this happen for four years. You sat and you'd ask one question to Biden and it was always the ice cream question, right? What flavor ice cream do you like best? \" I like vanilla.\" And that was the end of the conference. I think now we've done enough. These people are very busy. I want to just thank, this is the greatest, this has never been done before. First of all, a cabinet meeting was sacred. You'd never let the fake news media in. But the fake news media isn't all fake. A lot of it is, but it's not all. I think it's a great thing. I think maybe it's going to be done in the future. I hope it's going to be done. But you really get the word out. I mean, we had each one of these people spoke. I think each one, if I thought one of them did badly, I would call that person out. I would say, \"Christy, what the heck are you doing?\"\n\nSpeaker 29 (03:15:42):\n\n[inaudible 03:15:43].\n\nPresident Donald Trump (03:15:43):\n\nNo, but no, seriously. You have a very talented group of people. They get along, they work along together. And there's something really nice about just the openness of what we're doing. It's government. It's an open government. That's what we are.\n\nSpeaker 29 (03:15:58):\n\nIt's incredible.\n\nPresident Donald Trump (03:15:59):\n\nAnd we haven't made too many mistakes. We maybe will, but we haven't made too many mistakes. We've called it right. And I think you could be very proud of your country. We are a respected country again. We are really right now, respected at the highest level, and we're doing great. And we're a very rich country again. Very rich. And that's a good thing because when we're rich, we can take care of poor. And that's what we're doing. And we're taking care of crime. And I hope, just in finishing, I hope that Illinois, I hope that New York, I hope that California, I hope they call me and they say, \"I'd love to have you come in and help us out.\" I will be a totally different person with them. I will respect them for doing it. Thank you all very much. Thank you everybody.\n\nSpeaker 29 (03:16:45):\n\n[inaudible 03:16:51].",

    "transcript": "Donald Trump (00:00):\n\nWell, thank you very much. It's a very important day for many reasons. We've had a lot of important days lately, but this is a meeting and a group of people that are doing an unbelievable job in a thing called crime. And in particular, violent crime. Today we're going to be discussing it, and I watched as a very incompetent mayor from Chicago, said, \"Well, what do they know? They only arrested nine people.\" I said, \"Nine people? We didn't arrest nine people.\" We actually arrested a total of well over a thousand people. We took hundreds of guns away from young kids that were throwing them around like it was candy. We apprehended scores of illegal aliens. We seized dozens of illegal firearms. There have been zero murders. It sounds sort of terrible to say, it's embarrassing, I did this over the weekend. I'm making a speech and I acted like I was so proud as I said we've had zero murders in the last week.\n\n(01:04)And some of these people were from foreign countries. They said, \"That doesn't sound so good.\" And I said, \"Well, it doesn't sound good. But Washington was the most dangerous place in this country.\" And now, you know what? It's probably the safest place in our country. Everyone's starting to come here. The restaurants now, you can't get in. Many of them closed because they couldn't open with crime. Everybody before me is happy what I'm doing, most of you won't say that because you're radical left. The newspapers are so dishonest. The press is totally dishonest, but that's all right, we've gotten used to it. And we won in a landslide, so they obviously lost their power. I mean, it's impossible to imagine that when you get 97% negative stories, purposely negative stories, even though you've done 97% positive things, that you could win an election in a landslide winning all seven.\n\n(01:54)Think of it, all seven swing states winning by the popular vote by millions of votes. We had a fantastic… The best this year, districts, out of 3,000 districts, I guess we won, 3,500, we won 2,750 and they won 500. And that's, to me, the best of all. And we had tremendous, in every way, the election, and it's hard to believe you can do that when you have a corrupt media. But you are, many of you are corrupt, and it's nothing we can do about it. But we keep winning and we're going to keep winning. And this whole story on crime is incredible that the Democrats wouldn't be with us. So the mayor of Chicago, I watched him this morning, he said, \"Trump doesn't know what he's talking about. He only apprehended nine people.\" Well, number one, that's false. Literally it's thousands, we'll get into that.\n\n(02:48)But more importantly than anything, we took guns away, we have some of the worst career professionals out of the country already. They've been taken out of the country and some are in solid confinement because these were killers. We arrested some very bad people. And in the last 11 days, again, I hate to say it because it sounds so ridiculous, but in the last 11 days we've had no murders. And that's the first time that's taken place in years, actually years. We always have a murder a week. They call it a murder a week. You come here from Iowa, you come here from Indiana, you come here from Idaho, because you're so proud of your country, you love your country, and then you get murdered, your son gets murdered, your daughter gets murdered, you get murdered. See, the media, you get murdered. Many of you have been mugged in Washington you just don't want to talk about it.\n\n(03:36)And I know that every time I do this with you, you almost everything, but every time I do this with you, you people are saying to yourselves, he's right, he's right. And then you write a negative story. But we are doing an incredible job. The people behind me are amazing. We're working very well with the Washington Police, as you know. The DC National Guard is unbelievable. We're also getting tremendous help from Secret Service and we are at a point where Washington is booming again. People are pouring in like we haven't seen for years. Nobody wanted to come here. They didn't want to come here and get murdered. I have a friend of mine who has a very successful son and I said, \"Where is your son going to be this weekend?\" He said, \"He's going to Washington with his friends.\" I said, \"Really?\" \"Yeah, he's wanted to do it for four years, but he couldn't do it because it was so unsafe.\" And he's a tough kid too. It's so unsafe.\n\n(04:32)And he ended up staying and staying three nights, going out to restaurants all three nights. He said it was so beautiful, so peaceful because all the criminals are either arrested or they're hiding and we're finding the ones that are hiding. So I want to thank Pam Bondi. I want to thank our vice president. I want to thank everybody standing behind me because they are really… Gatti, you've been unbelievable by the way. They have done an unbelievable job. They're working 24 hours a day. And Washington DC is now in great shape. I'm going to be working with Clark Construction, which is by far your biggest construction company. And we're going to also beautify Washington. We're going to rip down the broken medians, fix them, we're going to put asphalt on the roads. We're not ripping them apart like these stupid people do. They rip a road down to the dirt, and then they spend five years in building the new one and then it starts settling. The whole thing is so crazy. And they'll spend hundreds of millions of dollars on a road. I'll spend about $2, and it'll look better.\n\n(05:35)So we're going to be replacing medians, we're going to be replacing much of the asphalt in the road in the city, which is in bad shape. We have great stripers, we have great contractors, but we have to let them do the thing. The Congress had said that they'll give us whatever money is needed to fix up the capital, this is the capital. And we're not going to spend a lot, it's going to go fast and it will be spotless. And we want it spotless for the World Cup and for the Olympics. You saw the World Cup was here the other day, and come to think of it, there's your trophy for the World Cup. In fact, it's solid gold. That's actually solid gold. So heavy that some of the people in this room wouldn't be able to lift that. I think what I'm going to do is place it right above the angel, right over there. That's solid goal too. We're going to put it right up there. Look at that, there's a solid gold trophy. They know how to get to me. I like the angel better to be honest with you. So we're going to sign and then we'll take a few questions and we'll tell you how good a job we're doing. And we want to go from here to other places. But I was telling some of the people that in a certain way you really want to be asked to go. I hate to barge in on a city and then be treated horribly by corrupt politicians and bad politicians, like a guy like Pritzker, he ought to spend more time in the gym, actually. The guy is a disaster. Gavin Newsom is a disaster. When we went, we saved Los Angeles. You wouldn't have been able to have the Olympics in Los Angeles. You're barely able to have it now, they did lose 25,000 houses to a fire that should have never occurred because they didn't let the water come down from the Pacific Northwest, which you guys don't want to write about. I had to break into the water supply to let the water down.\n\n(07:23)And even now, we want more. We can have much more. It's less than half of what should be coming in. I don't know, they have a political thing about it. It's like the craziest thing I've ever seen. But I don't like going to a town, city, place, a state and then be criticized by some corrupt or incompetent governor where crime is rampant. Take a look at DC, crime was rampant. It was at the all-time worst. It got really bad during the Biden four years. And then I have a mayor stand up and say how crime has reached a thirty-year low. Thirty-year low? People are being killed left and right. And it's not a thirty-year low. Think of it, so for 11 days there have been no murders, the record goes back years where that's happened. They haven't seen that happen in years.\n\n(08:11)And then people stand up and instead of thanking us, which they should do, and she's not that bad, she's better than most, but you know have people… I watched in Illinois, Chicago, Illinois is a disaster. I have property there. It's a disaster what's going on in Chicago. And you get a Pritzker guy, he's violating our rights. I think this is another men in women's sports thing. I think this is one of those, they call them 80-20 issues. I call them 90-7-3. I think the Democrats better get smart, and politically I hope they don't. But actually, in terms of love for the country, I hope they do because it would be good to work together. So I'm thinking about… When I have some slob like Pritzker criticizing us before we even go there, I made the statement that next should be Chicago, because as you all know, Chicago is a killing field right now.\n\n(09:03)And they don't acknowledge it. And they say, \"We don't need him. Freedom. Freedom. He's a dictator. He's a dictator.\" A lot of people are saying maybe we'd like a dictator. I don't like a dictator. I'm not a dictator. I'm a man with great common sense and I'm a smart person. And when I see what's happening to our cities and then you send in troops. Instead of being praised, they're saying, \"You're trying to take over the republic.\" These people are sick. But I'm really saying, and I say this to all of you. In a certain way, we should wait to be asked because they have cities that are so out of control. So we go in and fix it, they take the full credit for it and they go out and say… I heard it this morning. They're saying how well they've done over the last 10-day period. That they set record lows.\n\n(09:52)They don't say that we're there with very tough people by the way. They have to pass the toughness test otherwise they're not working for us. And we're allowed to do that now according to the United States Supreme Court decision, now they have to pass a toughness test. If they're not tough, we don't want them for this job. They might be great for other jobs, but not for this job because they're respected. You saw the gang of kids, they were all huddled up, and a group of soldiers walked up. They never even got over. Those kids ran back to their homes or wherever the hell they came from, they were gone. You have… This is one of the safest cities right now in the world, as crazy as that sounds, and it took seven days. It took really three days but we're now in our 11th day.\n\n(10:34)So I want to thank you. So we had all of these things, 439 illegal alien criminals have been removed and we have six known gang members, some of the worst leaders of gangs anywhere in the country. MS-13 and Tren de Aragua with two missing children that have been recovered. They thought they were gone. We brought them back to the family. The family started crying. They couldn't believe that they saw their child again. 49 homeless encampments have been removed. We have the head of South Korea coming in in a little while, the president, and he drives down the street, already, his people have told me, he said, \"What happened? It's so clean. We always came here, it was filthy dirty with homeless and papers all over the road.\" That's the other thing, those roads are swept immaculate. But they're going to be much better in a few months when we put a topping on them, they're going to look like they're brand new and we'll get rid of those rusty old medians that have been crashed into a thousand times, and they don't fix them. They just let them.\n\n(11:38)They put them, they lay them down on the road and they sit there for months. But we don't do that. We don't run things. We run things like we run this. We like clean, we like beautiful, we like safe. And that's what we're getting. So I'll start signing the executive orders. To me, there's a very, very big deal. One of the executive orders has to do with cashless bail. That was when the big crime in this country started. And I can tell you who did it, when, but I don't want to do that because others followed pretty quickly. But that was when it happened. Somebody kills somebody, they go in, \"Don't worry about it, no cash. Come back in a couple of months, we'll give you a trial.\" You never see the person again.\n\n(12:19)And I mean, they kill people and they get out, cashless bail. They thought it was discriminatory to make people put up money because they just killed three people lying on a street, any street all over the country, cashless bail. We're ending it. But we're starting by ending it in DC and that we have the right to do through federalization. Okay, let's go. Could I ask you to say exactly what this is?\n\nSpeaker 1 (12:44):\n\nOf course. So as you've consistently identified, sir, cashless bail policies are a key driver of the disorder we see on city streets all over America. Catch-and-release system allows criminals to keep going back out onto the street and re-offending. What this executive order does, it charges your attorney general with identifying jurisdictions all over the country that have cashless bail policies and then it withholds or revokes federal funds and grants that are flowing to those jurisdictions to ensure that we're only supporting the people who have reasonable common-sense policies around crime.\n\nDonald Trump (13:16):\n\nSo what area does it cover?\n\nSpeaker 1 (13:18):\n\nPotentially anywhere that has a cashless bail policy. So some of the largest cities, some of the most left-wing states in America have adopted-\n\nDonald Trump (13:25):\n\nAlmost all of them, right?\n\nSpeaker 1 (13:26):\n\nYip. Illinois would be a great example of that, sir.\n\nDonald Trump (13:29):\n\nOh, they have a great cashless bail. You don't even have to go to court sometimes. No, Illinois, I love that state, it's a great state, but it's run so badly by Pritzker. They threw him out of the family business and he becomes governor. Now he wants to run for president. I don't think that's going to happen. Okay, we'll sign right here, right.\n\nSpeaker 1 (13:46):\n\nSir.\n\nDonald Trump (13:52):\n\nSo important. And this isn't Republican Democrat, this is… And by the way, most Democrats agree with this, but this is just we got to bring our country back. Okay, that's a big one.\n\nSpeaker 1 (14:12):\n\nAlso on the issue of cashless bail, sir, this is a DC-specific executive order. In addition to the measures that we're taking that are quite similar to what we're doing around the country in DC in particular, the objective is holding as many criminal defendants in federal custody and subjecting them to federal charges as possible. That means that they'll be held pretrial in federal jail as opposed to just being cut back out on the streets due to a cashless bail policy.\n\nDonald Trump (14:37):\n\nAnd we have the room. And by the way, the prison they have in DC is horrible. It's horrible. People were subjected to live in that dog trap for so long, so unfairly. I have stories. You'll be hearing about them. That prison is horrible. Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1 (15:03):\n\nThis is an executive order that contains a number of additional measures relating to crime and law enforcement in Washington DC. It charges, for example, your Secretary of Defense with establishing specialized units in both the DC National Guard and the National Guard units around the country, specifically trained and equipped to deal with public order issues. It charges all of your various federal law enforcement agencies with hiring additional personnel to allow them to surge personnel to Washington DC to deal with the current emergency here. It does a number of other things in that space and it also asks the Attorney General to look at DC Metropolitan Police general orders that have currently impeded law enforcement efforts in the city, and to potentially look at unwinding those that are stopping the police from doing their job effectively.\n\nDonald Trump (15:53):\n\nAnd are we going to ask this to be codified by Congress? All of these things?\n\nSpeaker 1 (15:57):\n\nI think we could potentially, yes, sir.\n\nDonald Trump (15:59):\n\nI think so. I think we should. I think we'll get it. I think Democrats will vote. Well, it's hard to believe that they might not, but I think Democrats will actually vote for this. There's no auto pen that can do that, right? Look at that, Pam, is that a good signature?\n\nPam Bondi (16:21):\n\nThere's not. It's a great signature.\n\nDonald Trump (16:22):\n\nSeriously, is that a good signature? Who can write like that? Nobody. I don't know. That's the other thing, I assume we're looking at the whole auto pen scam because the person that ran it said he spoke to it briefly twice about nothing. That means that all those pardons that he gave to some very bad people, very unpatriotic people, very evil people, it looks to me like those pardons are worthless because number one, you shouldn't use an auto pen, very specifically, but if you do, it has to be a very good reason. And they have to know that the president wanted it. The president didn't want this. The president didn't know he was alive, okay? He never approved any of this stuff. He wasn't for open borders and all the other things. He was never for open borders. I've known Biden a long time. He was never very sharp, but he was never in favor of open borders and all of the other things he did to destroy our country. Let's go.\n\nSpeaker 1 (17:22):\n\nLastly, sir. This is an executive order on flag burning. It charges your attorney general-\n\nDonald Trump (17:26):\n\nWill you listen to this? This is very important. Flag burning. All over the country, they're burning flags. All over the world, they burn the American flag. And as you know, through a very sad court, I guess it was a five-to-four decision, they called it freedom of speech. But there's another reason, which is perhaps much more important, it's called death. Because what happens when you burn a flag is the area goes crazy. If you have hundreds of people, they go crazy. You can do other things. You can burn this piece of paper, but when you burn the American flag, it incites riots at levels that we've never seen before. People go crazy. In a way both ways. There are some that are going crazy for doing it. There are others that are angry, angry about them doing it. Do you want to discuss that?\n\nSpeaker 1 (18:19):\n\nSure. What the executive order does, sir, it charges your Department of Justice with investigating instances of flag burning. And then where there's evidence of criminal activity where prosecution wouldn't fall afoul of the First Amendment and instructs the Department of Justice to prosecute those who are engaged in these instances of flag burning.\n\nDonald Trump (18:37):\n\nAnd what the penalty is going to be, if you burn a flag, you get one year in jail. No early exits, no nothing. You get one year in jail. If you burn a flag, you get… And what it does is incite to riot. I hope they used that language, by the way. Did they?\n\nSpeaker 1 (18:54):\n\nIncitement is in there.\n\nDonald Trump (18:55):\n\nIncite to riot. And you burn a flag, you get one year in jail. You don't get 10 years, you don't get one month. You get one year in jail and it goes on your record. And you'll see flag burning stopping immediately. Just like when I signed the Statute and Monument Act. 10 years in jail, if you heard any of our beautiful monuments, everybody left town, they were gone. Never had a problem after that. It's pretty amazing. We stopped it. But this is something that's, I don't know, in a certain way, it's equally as important. Some people would say it's more important because the people in this country don't want to see our American flag burned and spit on. And by people that are in many cases, paid agitators. They're paid by the radical left to do it.\n\n(19:42)You talk to these people, they don't even know… Half of them don't even know what they're doing. They say, \"I don't know. They gave me money to do this.\" I see the same things that you do. They're bad people that are trying to destroy our nation. That's not working because I think our nation now is the most respected nation anywhere in the world by far. You saw that with\n\nDonald Trump (20:00):\n\nWith the European leaders on Friday, you saw that with NATO where they agreed to go from 2%, no pay, to 5% fully paid up, trillions of dollars paid, where they respect your president to a level that they jokingly call me the president of Europe. They call me the president of Europe, which is an honor, I like Europe and I like those people. They're good people, they're great leaders. And we've never had a case where seven plus, really 28, essentially 35, 38 countries were represented here the other day. 38 European countries were… European and other countries were represented, and it was a great meeting. But your country's respected again. I say it all the time, one year ago, our country was dead, everybody said it. We had a dead country, we were not going to survive. Now we have the hottest country anywhere in the world. So it's an honor to be involved and this group has a lot to do with it, right behind me. Does anybody behind me have anything? Pam, would you like to say something?\n\nPam Bondi (21:10):\n\nSure, President, thank you for keeping D.C safe. Just a couple examples of a mother, a single mom whose house was burglarized and the defendant got out on cashless bail, went back the next night and burglarized her house again, that's why this is so important. A man got in a fight with another guy, he had a gun, he was let out. Next night, he got up, went back, and killed him. So that's why it's so important, President, what you're doing. And thank you, and thank you for protecting the American flag. And we'll do that without running a foul of the First Amendment as well. And President, I think Terry Cole… Excuse me. I think Gady Serralta had something he wanted to give you on behalf of all the law enforcement who are out there every single night.\n\nGady Serralta (21:55):\n\nMr. President-\n\nDonald Trump (21:55):\n\nYes.\n\nGady Serralta (21:56):\n\nThank you for putting me in charge of this surge as the director of the United States Marshals Service, it's the oldest law enforcement agency. It was created in 1789. So on behalf of all the federal law enforcement agencies that we're working with and those that have yet to join the team, we thought it was only appropriate to present you with an honorary United States Marshals service badge. And this badge comes with this little item right here, which is a handcuff key, Mr. President. Because you continue through your policies and your efforts with your staff to un-handcuff law enforcement officers all over this nation. And I can tell you personally that they thank you for that.\n\nDonald Trump (22:51):\n\nThank you. That's beautiful to hear.\n\nGady Serralta (22:52):\n\nContinue un-handcuffing law enforcement.\n\nDonald Trump (22:55):\n\nThat's a very great honor. I'll save that and put it someplace up, which is important. Thank you very much, guys, appreciate it. Thank you very much. Really nice, thank you. That's very nice. Thank you. Well, we love those people. They're brave, and they love our country, and they don't want to see… They don't want to see it… Do you know how many people volunteered for this job? And before I ask the VP to say a few words, because he feels very strongly about it, I think it's very important, Pam, that when we do this, that a state require… they come and ask us. I mean, I see Pritzker saying we don't want them, in the meantime his city is being shot to hell. And they do that politically. And they probably do want it. If we didn't go to Los Angeles, you would literally have had to call off the Olympics. It was so bad.\n\n(23:47)And the Sheriff, and the law enforcement people, but the sheriff said, and he came out very strongly, he said, \"If we didn't have these people, we were not able to control it.\" Now four days later, after we had it totally under control, we did that quickly, he changed his tune a little bit. \"Well, I think we could have done it,\" you know? They were dead. If we didn't send in the troops, Los Angeles was dead, the Olympics was gone, the World Cup was gone, everything was gone. We did a great job. And Newsom, you got an… I mean, he's an incompetent governor. But I think people should want us to be there because otherwise all they'll do is complain as we do our job, so we'll have to think about that, okay? We go in, like in Washington, we go in and the people that are here that have been doing… I don't want to say terrible because she happens, you know, she's a nice woman I guess. I don't care about if she's nice, I really don't care. I want her to do… I'd rather have her be horrible, but do the job.\n\n(24:44)But we come into Washington and we have the 11 best days they've had here in two centuries. I mean, they've never seen anything like it. Let's go two decades in over 20 years, they haven't seen anything like what happened. And now they're out there saying, \"We don't have crime in Washington.\" Well, that's true, for 11 days you don't have crime. But before that, everybody was getting hit and mugged and you people could not walk to your office without security. That's how unsafe it was. So I think we should really let them have their city, let their city go to hell, and when they come and beg us to help… The only problem is we want to save it for the… Because the people want us there. The people here, 95% of the people here want us, the real people not the people you find… I don't know where you find these people.\n\n(25:34)You have one person has a broken nose, \"Where'd you get it?\" \"Well, I was mugged.\" Good. \"Do you want to see Trump here with…\" \"No, I don't want…\" The woman has a broken nose, she got mugged, but she's saying she doesn't want any protection. It's all made up fake news, it's just fake news. I don't know where you find these people. Anyway, would you say a couple of words please? And then I'm going to ask JD to say something. You have done an unbelievable job in a short period of time.\n\nTerry Cole (26:02):\n\nThank you, Mr. President.\n\nDonald Trump (26:02):\n\nHighly recommended by you know who, right?\n\nTerry Cole (26:03):\n\nYes, sir.\n\nDonald Trump (26:05):\n\nDo you want to say his name?\n\nTerry Cole (26:07):\n\nMr. Youngkin, Governor Youngkin. Yes, sir.\n\nPam Bondi (26:09):\n\nWe stole you from Governor Youngkin.\n\nJD Vance (26:09):\n\nThat's right.\n\nDonald Trump (26:10):\n\nHe called me, Glenn Youngkin called, and he said, \"I have somebody who's really fantastic.\" And based on that recommendation, here you are. You've done a fantastic job. I appreciate it.\n\nTerry Cole (26:20):\n\nThank you, Mr. President.\n\nDonald Trump (26:21):\n\nThank you. Go ahead.\n\nTerry Cole (26:22):\n\nThe men and women of the Metropolitan Police Department are back. They enjoy doing their job again. They feel the ability to go out and be law enforcement officers. They feel that they're connected to their communities again. They are making a difference. Thanks to you, Mr. President and our federal task force, you are making D.C once again.\n\nDonald Trump (26:43):\n\nGood.\n\nTerry Cole (26:44):\n\nThank you, sir.\n\nDonald Trump (26:44):\n\nIt's going to get better and better. Well, it can't get much better, there's no crime. I read where crime's down 89%. I said, \"Really? Who are the 11%?\" Okay. There's no crime. JD, please.\n\nJD Vance (26:56):\n\nYes, sir. Well, thanks, Mr. President. Thanks to the incredible team here. I want to echo something the President said, where you say there haven't been murders in a couple of weeks in D.C, and it doesn't sound good. But then you talk to local law enforcement, and I didn't realize this, that this town averaged one murder every other day for the last 20, 30 years. Which means that in two short weeks, the president and the team have saved six or seven lives, people who would've been killed on the streets of D.C, who are now living, breathing, spending time with their families because the president had the willpower to say, no more, we're not going to give the streets of D.C over to vagrants and robbers and murderers.\n\n(27:36)And the last point I want to make, sir, to your point about we want people to welcome us to ask us, because look at Governor Pritzker in Illinois or Governor Newsom in Los Angeles or Governor Moore in Maryland, they're angrier about the fact that the president of the United States is offering to help them get their crime under control than they are about the fact that murderers are running roughshod over their cities and have been for decades. Why are Democrat governors angrier about federal law enforcement helping clean up their streets than they are about the fact that those streets need to be cleaned up to begin with? It shows a real sickness in the head. And I agree with the president of the United States, I think most Democrats rank and file, nobody likes crime. Republicans don't like crime, Democrats don't like crime, Independents don't like crime. Why are democratic governors doing everything in their power to make crime easier to do in their cities? It doesn't make an ounce of sense to me, but Mr. President, I appreciate you being willing to help and I hope these governors take you up on the offer because we should clean up all of America's streets. It's the right of every American to live in safety and comfort in their community.\n\nDonald Trump (28:41):\n\nAnd we've got the people to do it. They're signing up like they'd never signed up before. Our military, as you know, during the campaign, nobody was signing up. We were way short, short of their goals, short of their… We were understaffed, nobody wanted to be in the military, nobody wanted to be a policeman, nobody wanted to be a fireman. They didn't want anything to do with the country. We had an incompetent, grossly incompetent president who frankly should not have been there, he should have never been there. The damage he did to this country is incalculable. I mean, just what he has done, so much of our effort are getting murderers and jailbirds and people out of this country who are drug dealers at the highest level.\n\n(29:26)So much of the energy of people that he let in, it was an unforced error, but I don't think they think it's an error, but I don't believe he believed it. It was the radical lunatics that surrounded this guy at this desk who are brilliant people, but with the wrong philosophy. There were some brilliant people, but they're evil people and they're going to be brought down. They have to be brought down because they really hurt our country. But we're getting it back very quickly. And I'll tell you something, our country's now, it's stronger. I think we're more respected than we've been respected in a hundred years. It's a whole different ballgame. JD, can I ask you?\n\nJD Vance (30:01):\n\nYes, sir.\n\nDonald Trump (30:02):\n\nYou gave a stat on murders here. What were the numbers? You said in a short period of time how many people were murdered?\n\nJD Vance (30:08):\n\nLocal law enforcement told me, sir, that in the past 20 or 30 years, D.C has averaged a murder every other day. That's 200 murders a year, 150, 250. But about every other day, a person has been killed on the streets of Washington D.C. We've been doing this for two weeks, zero people killed. That's real lives saved that the media, and frankly, the entire Democratic party should be saying thank you for saving lives instead of attacking the president of the United States for doing so.\n\nDonald Trump (30:36):\n\nYou know when the person, when a person unfortunately will probably happen at some point when a person's murdered in D.C, it's going to be the biggest story maybe in history. Right?\n\nJD Vance (30:47):\n\nYes, sir.\n\nDonald Trump (30:48):\n\nSomebody was murdered in D.C., Trump is failing. No, we're not failing, we have a safe city. This is maybe the safest city in America right now. That's how good it is. And it would be nice to be appreciated. These people eventually, they're going to have to be appreciated for what they're doing and they're going to have to be appreciated by the officials that are really happy when we go in because they've lost control of their place. Steve Miller, please, say a few words.\n\nSteve Miller (31:12):\n\nThank you, sir. So just to, first of all, follow up on what the vice president said, no police officer working in the city can remember a time in their lives when there has been no murders. You can work with the police department for 20 years, 30 years, your whole life. We've checked the records, no one can even find a record of being murder-free for as long as you've been murder-free under President Trump's leadership. Additionally, and the president spoke about this before, but we've uncovered in the process of uncovering a massive scandal in Washington D.C with the doctoring of crime stats. And the Department of Justice under the Attorney General is leading the effort to uncover this. But when we ultimately share the results, it will stun you. The extent to which even though DC had the worst crime in America, honestly measured, it dramatically understated how bad it was. There's even accusations that murders and homicides were reported as accidents instead of murders. I mean, this is how severe the manipulation of the crime data has been in the city. And it will all be uncovered and it'll all be brought to light.\n\n(32:16)I've had a chance to spend some time, as everyone here, with the police officers in the city, members of the public are going up to them and thanking them, just overflowing with radicals because the first time in their lives they can use the parks, they can walk on the streets. You have people who can walk freely at night without having to worry about being robbed, or mugged, or wearing their watches again. They're wearing jewelry again, they're carrying purses again. People had changed their whole lives in this city for fear of being murdered, mugged, and carjacked. It is a literal statement that President Trump has freed 700,000 people in this city who were living under the rule of criminals and thugs.\n\n(32:55)And the last thing I'll say is that under the efforts of Terry to my left and many here, what they found also is that the street criminals here in Washington D.C were doing business directly with the transnational criminal cartels, the foreign terrorist organizations. So not only was the city being run by these criminal thugs, but they were working with some of the most dangerous terrorist organizations on the planet to traffic, weapons and drugs into this city. And what we're uncovering every day is shocking to us, and we look forward to sharing all the results with you. But President Trump, your leadership has uncovered some of the great public safety scandals of our life. And now because of you, people are safe and free for the first time ever in this city.\n\nDonald Trump (33:38):\n\nThank you very much, Steve. You know, in Los Angeles, Beverly Hills is great place. I have a house there. I had a house there. I used to stay a lot of time, spend a lot of time there, and great place. Do you know that I have friends, they leave their trunk open for their car because they know they're going to be vandalized, they don't want the trunk ripped off in order for them to steal what's in the back. They leave the doors open, so when they go in to steal the radio or whatever they take that they don't rip off the door. They leave the doors totally open, so the criminals, when they go and open the door, they don't have to break the windows and kill the car in order to steal whatever it is in the car that they're looking for.\n\n(34:18)And that's at a level that nobody's ever seen before, nobody lives like that. I have another friend, he has a garage, and in order to save his garage door, he leaves it open so that people can just walk into his garage, take whatever they want and leave. But all the cars are so many cars, I've been told this by many people, stars, big people, they leave their doors open so the doors aren't destroyed by these criminals. All over Los Angeles, this is taking place. And you know that. I mean, you've heard that. Kristi, could you say a few words for us?\n\nKristi Noem (34:54):\n\nSure. Well, Mr. President, I think one of the most impactful statistics that you use today was of the a thousand arrests that have happened already so far. 439 of them were illegal criminals, which means they never should have been in this country to begin with, but they were in this country invaded over our southern border or our northern border or maritime seas, and then they committed crimes against the American people. So by getting those individuals incarcerated, we've stopped those violent crimes from happening here in the city. And sir, they do exactly like Stephen was talking, they have ties to cartels, they have networks across this country and other cities. So by what you're doing here is going to have a ripple effect in Miami, in Chicago, in other cities because you're grabbing those networks and giving us information and targeting information to go and get more criminals across this country. So thank you for the work that you're doing.\n\n(35:47)We have ICE and CBP, Federal Protective Services, Secret Service, HSI, all of our officers are working with all the other agencies every day here in D.C, and they're so proud to have this kind of partnership, sir. They're so glad that you're letting them do their jobs again. And I don't know if you've heard, sir, but the recruitment campaign for ICE, when we were going to hire 10,000 new officers, we've got over 130,000 people that have applied and raised their hands and said they want to work with ICE. So no matter what the fake news says or what the media says about ICE not having support, they've got incredible support from the American people. People want to join them and help them do what they're doing to make America safe again. So thank you for that opportunity.\n\nDonald Trump (36:29):\n\nI was going to say that our recruitment drive, so it was dead. During the campaign, they couldn't get… Every story was the Army can't fill up, the Marines, none of them could fill up. They were way behind. We couldn't get anybody to go into the military, couldn't get any police. We have just set records on everybody wants to be in, everybody wants to go in, and we're taking incredible people. I mean the level of… Because of the Supreme Court, it's based on merit. It's all based on merit now, it's not based on anything else. If you need strong people, you have to get strong people. It's all based on merit. But we're setting records in the Army, Navy, Air Force, Marines, the Coast Guard, one of my favorites because I happened to have created it, Space Force. We're very proud of Space Force, it's amazing what it's doing.\n\n(37:15)We are leading in space now. China was killing us, Russia was beating us. China was killing us, we're now killing… We are leading in space by a lot because of Space Force, so we're very proud. But everybody wants to go in. We went from not… And you know how bad that is for the spirit when every story that you were writing a year ago was that nobody wants to go into the military anymore. And if you're in the military, you know how deflating that is. You go home to your family, nobody wants a job that you have. Well, now it's the opposite. Everybody wants to be there and that includes police and fire and everything else. You're doing a good job.\n\nPete Hegseth (37:52):\n\nThank you, sir.\n\nDonald Trump (37:52):\n\nYou're stopping a lot of wars? Just the presence we're stopping… We've stopped seven wars, and really the number is actually 10. We're not including a couple, and we're not including in there what we did with Iran, stopping their nuclear play. They would've had within a month or two, they would've had a nice big nuclear weapon to use. That's not going to happen, that won't happen. Pete, go ahead please.\n\nPete Hegseth (38:17):\n\nYes, sir. Well, Mr. President, thank you very much for your leadership. And the defense department is proud to be a part of this task force. Just like we have been down at the southwest border where crossings are at zero, we've got national defense areas where we're working with border patrol to secure the southern border for the American people, just like Los Angeles, where ICE officers deserve to do their job without being attacked, we're really proud to be a part of defending the nation's capital and ensuring it is safe and beautiful and working with law enforcement. And Mr. President, let me tell you, the morale of the troops getting out there talking to them, they love this mission, they're grateful to be doing it. Whether they're D.C National Guard or other state national guards, and at your direction as well, sir, it's just common sense to make sure they're armed as well. And so they were rolling out, ensuring they're armed, capable of defending themselves and others if need be, supporting law enforcement, and we're proud to be there, sir.\n\nDonald Trump (39:05):\n\nWell, look at the mission you just accomplished with Iran. 36 hours back and forth, flawless, every bomb hit its target. They went right down those chutes, dark at night, no moon, no nothing, every target, every bomb went right down. They have a chute that goes right down deep into the mountain and they shouldn't have put ventilation in, I can tell you because we used that for our advantage. But what they did… And we had the pilots and even the people that took care of the planes, we had a whole group of people at the White House a couple of weeks ago. And I didn't realize this, but they said… We've been looking at their predecessors, and then, these were the pilots, they said we gave them beautiful medals. And I'll show you the medal. We them a medal just like this. See? Just like that. They were so happy. Gave a lot of them out for that, it was an incredible job. We had 52 tankers, people\n\nDonald Trump (40:00):\n\n… world realized so that they could refuel. We had many fighter jets, F-22s and F-35s. We had many. It was an amazing operation. It was flawless. Compare that to the operation when they went in with the helicopters crashing and everyone running around the desert and the prisoners being taken, and that was Jimmy Carter. What a horrible thing. This was the exact opposite. This was the exact opposite of what they did in leaving a very, very nice place. The Taliban runs a tough operation in Afghanistan, and I think it was the most embarrassing day in the history of our country. That was Biden. I was leaving and we would've left through strength, tremendous strength. We would've had tremendous… We would've kept Bagram, which is the airbase, one of the largest runways in the world, one of the most powerful. You could land anything on it. Many, many feet thick. You don't build them that way anymore. You can't. But we left it. And now China's occupying that airbase. This was the most incompetent administration in history, the Biden administration. And you're just lucky that they lost because if they won, you wouldn't have a country anymore. And so Pete, you started off by saying the Department of Defense, and somehow it didn't sound good to me. It didn't sound good. Defense. What are we defense? Why are we defense? So it used to be called the Department of War and it had a stronger sound. And as you know, we won World War I. We won World War II. We won everything. Now we have a Department of Defense with defenders. I don't know. If you people want to standing behind me, if you take a little vote, if you want to change it back to what it was when we used to win wars all the time, that's okay with me. All right?\n\nSpeaker 2 (41:45):\n\nThat's common sense, sir.\n\nDonald Trump (41:46):\n\nYou go. You let me know if you want to do it. I think Department of War, it just sounded bad. He said, \"Sir, on behalf of the Department of Defense,\" Defense? I don't want to be defense only. We want defense, but we want offense too, if that's okay. So you'll make a decision. But as Department of War, we won everything. We won everything. And I think we're going to have to go back to that. In the meantime, I've stopped all of these wars. I've stopped them. A big one would've been India and Pakistan, but we stopped them all. We stopped three wars. Go to Africa. They like to say, \"Oh.\" Let me tell you, I love Black people and I did great with the vote with the Black people. But they say, \"He's a racist. He's a racist.\" I said, \"Really?\" For 35 years, a war raged between Rwanda and the Republic of the Congo, and it was a vicious war. 9 million people were killed with machetes, largely, hatchets, machetes. That went on for more than 30 years, but 34, 35 years.\n\n(42:46)And I stopped it. In fact, the presidents are coming in a week or two to sign the… We have the foreign ministers. It's all signed. The war stopped, but I got it stopped and saved a lot of lives. The Congo, that's deep into deepest, darkest Africa. I got that war stopped. Nobody else could have done that. We did a lot of jobs. A lot of wars were stopped that nobody thought would even be possible. And I'll tell you what, the war with India and Pakistan, that was the next level that was going to be a nuclear war. They already shot down seven jets. That was raging. And I said, \"You guys want to do trade? We're not doing any trade. We're not doing anything with you if you keep fighting. You got 24 hours to settle it.\" They said, \"Well, there's no more war going.\"\n\n(43:35)And I used that on numerous occasions, trade. I used trade. I used other… I used whatever you had to use. But we got seven of them stopped. And the one I thought would be easiest, frankly, was going to be Russia and Ukraine. But that turns out to be some big personality conflicts. It's one of those things. But we're going to get that stopped eventually. We're going to get that stopped too. 7,000 soldiers died last week. Think of that, 7,000. I usually say 5,000, but 7,221 soldiers died last week and they're fighting between Ukraine and Russia. And they're not our soldiers, but they're souls. They're living souls. And they leave their homes and they wave to their parents, and their parents are so proud. They leave in a beautiful uniform and a week later they get their head blown off by a drone. New form of military. It's a whole new form of fighting. So I would just like to thank the people that are behind me. Thank you very much. You've done a fantastic job. I appreciate it very much.\n\n(44:38)We're doing a real job, and I'm so proud of D.C. I passed it two days ago and all the garbage is off the streets. It's terrible. I came in a month and a half ago. I'm driving down and I see garbage all over the place. The streets were a pigsty. I won't use the city's names, but you know what I'm talking about. There are plenty of them outside of this country and inside of this country. Baltimore is a horrible, horrible deathbed. It's a deathbed. I know Governor Moore said, \"Oh, he wants to take a walk with me.\" He meant it in a derogatory tone. I said, \"No, no. I'm the President of the United States. Clean up your crime and I'll walk with you.\" But it's tremendous crime. But he was trying to be derogatory. He doesn't have what it takes, but he's trying to be derogatory. And I met him at the Army-Navy game. They said, \"Oh, there's Governor Moore. He'd love to see you.\" He came over to me, he hugged me, he shook my hand. You were there. He said, \"Sir, you're the greatest president of my lifetime.\" I said, \"It's really nice that you say that. I'd love you to say it publicly, but I don't think you can do that, so it's okay.\" But, \"No, sir, you're doing a fantastic job. I want to just shake your hand.\" \"Thank you very much, Governor.\" That was it. And then every time I see him on television, he's knocking the hell out of me. But that's all right. That's called politics. But Governor Moore's got… He's doing a bad job. Newsom's doing a bad job. All of their potential candidates are doing a bad job. I can't imagine Pritzker being even a candidate, but somebody said he is. He can't do the work, can't do the job. He's not temperamentally suited. So I just want to thank you all for being here. Do you have some questions?\n\nSpeaker 2 (46:20):\n\n… the Pentagon and maybe the Secretary of Defense can weigh into, is the Pentagon preparing for military deployment to Chicago? And with what you said there, are you waiting for the government-\n\nDonald Trump (46:30):\n\nWe're ready to go anywhere.\n\nSpeaker 2 (46:31):\n\nDo you want him to call you though?\n\nDonald Trump (46:35):\n\nWe have a full complement of great human beings. We're full. Our military is full. We were way empty one year ago. Now we're full. So we can go anywhere on less than 24 hours notice.\n\nSpeaker 2 (46:50):\n\nAre you waiting for the government-\n\nDonald Trump (46:50):\n\nAnd we're doing a lot to interdict to stop drugs from coming in too. We have ships out on sea. We have nobody coming through our border anymore. Nobody. Doesn't that feel good to know that you don't have prisoners coming in and killers, murderers? We had 11,888 murderers led in by the Biden administration. Many of them have been captured, but we still have a couple of thousand that are out there. Some of them, 50% of them killed more than one person, but a lot of them have been captured. What they've done to our country, these people, the circle, this moron that we had behind this desk, what they've done to our country is unthinkable. It's unthinkable. I mean, if you think so much of our time is devoted to correcting a problem that all they had to do is say \"close the borders.\" Remember when he said, \"Well, I have no power to close the border. I have to go back and get an act from Congress.\" I didn't get an act from Congress. I came in, I said, \"Close the borders.\" And Tom Homan, who's not here, has been fantastic. Christie, right?\n\nChristie (47:51):\n\nHe has been. Yes, sir.\n\nDonald Trump (47:52):\n\nTom Homan is great. He is a fantastic man and respected by everybody. But I said, \"Tom, close the borders. Christie, close the borders.\" The borders were closed. We didn't go to Congress and get permission. We just closed the borders. And in the last three months, hard to believe this one too, in the last three months, we've had zero people come into our country illegally through the southern border. Nobody would've said That's possible. Yeah, please.\n\nSpeaker 3 (48:20):\n\nThank you, Mr. President. Today, MS-13 gangbanger and human trafficker Kilmar Abrego Garcia turned himself into ICE in Baltimore. Do you have any comment on this? And why are the Democrats so emotionally attached to this man who beats his wife and is part of a terrorist organization?\n\nDonald Trump (48:37):\n\nBecause they think he's going to be good for votes and I think he's very bad for votes. These people are deranged. He's not good for votes. He beat the hell out of his wife. His wife is afraid to even talk about him. She's been mauled by this animal and through a system of liberal courts, he's doing things. But no, we have that under control and Pam has got that very much under control. Do you want to comment on it, Pam?\n\nPam (49:05):\n\nNo, no. We've got him under control. He will no longer terrorize our country. He's currently charged with human smuggling, including children. The guy needs to be in prison. He doesn't need to be on the streets like all these liberals want him to be. And as part of this operation here in D.C., we've also taken off MS-13 members. We've taken, I think just last night we got a TDA guy off our streets right here, right around from where we all work, another TDA member, gone because of this project. So we're going to keep America safe from all of these foreign terrorist organizations, including Abrego Garcia.\n\nDonald Trump (49:51):\n\nOkay. Steve?\n\nSteve (49:52):\n\nIf we could get your reaction, sir. The Israelis bombed a hospital in Gaza, killed 20 people, including five journalists.\n\nDonald Trump (49:54):\n\nWhen did this happen?\n\nSteve (49:55):\n\nThis happened overnight today.\n\nDonald Trump (49:57):\n\nI didn't know that.\n\nSteve (49:59):\n\nAny reaction to this?\n\nDonald Trump (50:00):\n\nWell, I'm not happy about it. I don't want to see it. At the same time, we have to end that whole nightmare. I'm the one that got the hostages out. I got them out, all of them. Steve Witkoff has been amazing. He's done a great job. But I'm the one that got them all out through my people and through me. And now we're left with probably a little bit less than 20 because I think one or two are gone. And I said a long time ago, \"I'm going to get them out,\" but when we get down to that final 10 or 20, these people aren't going to release them because they're dead after they release them. So it's a nasty situation. Very nasty. Horrible thing. Yes?\n\nSpeaker 4 (50:35):\n\nMr. President, could you please elaborate on your post on South Korea? What were you referring to?\n\nDonald Trump (50:40):\n\nWell, I heard that there were raids on churches over the last few days. Very vicious raids on churches by the new government in South Korea that they even went into our military base and got information that. They probably shouldn't have done that. But I heard bad things. I don't know if it's true or not. I'll be finding out as you know, your new president's coming in just a couple of hours, coming here. I look forward to meeting him. But we won't stand for that. We just won't stand for that.\n\nSpeaker 5 (51:07):\n\nAre you prepared to order National Guard troops though into American cities if those governors don't request the federal deployment?\n\nDonald Trump (51:14):\n\nI am, but I also think that, look, Chicago, everybody knows how bad it is. Everybody standing there knows. We know. You don't have to be doing any studies. They should be saying, \"Please come in.\" Pritzker should be saying that. I did a favor for Christie Whitmer, a good favor, I think with the fish, the carp, the China carp. Did you ever hear of it? China carp. And it's taken over your Great Lakes. You know about that, right? And she came and she wanted to know if it's possible for us to do something about it. And I said, \"Well, I'll do,\" but I think it's appropriate that the person from Illinois, the governor from Illinois asks also. It's a tremendously expensive project actually. It's invasive. It's horrible what's happened. And we can do it with GSA and various people, but we can do it, we're going to just have to see what happens. We're going to have to see what happens.\n\nSpeaker 5 (52:20):\n\nDo you believe that you have the legal authority-\n\nDonald Trump (52:22):\n\nBut the governor of Michigan came, was very respectful, asked for it. She's done a good job. I did that. I opened the Air Force base, kept it open for F-35s and various planes, F-22s too. I did that for the state of Michigan at her request. And also in our congressmen, we have congressmen that are unbelievably pro-Michigan up there. But some of this stuff, like the lakes, the Great Lakes, this is a big problem that nobody ever talks about. Most of you probably have never heard of. We have a pretty violent fish that comes from China, China carp, Chinese carp, and you see them jumping out. They jump into boats and they jump all over the place. They've got a lot of energy. And there's a way of getting rid of them. It's very expensive. And I didn't get a request from the governor of Illinois is affected maybe more than anybody else. And I think until I get that request from that guy, I'm not going to do anything about it.\n\n(53:30)And I feel the same way about crime. We go in, we will solve Chicago within one week, maybe less, but within one week, we will have no crime in Chicago, just like we have no crime in D.C. But I don't like to go in and do it and then have somebody stand up and say, \"What a great job he's doing on crime. And we don't want the military in our state. We don't want the military.\" Do you understand? Do you understand that?\n\nSpeaker 5 (53:55):\n\nYeah, these governors will say-\n\nDonald Trump (53:56):\n\nSo I don't know.\n\nSpeaker 5 (53:56):\n\n… there is no emergency respondent.\n\nDonald Trump (53:56):\n\nSo we're going to have a little meeting, I think. I feel like we go in and we do it, like here. To a lesser extent with the mayor. She hasn't been terrible, but she hasn't been exactly saying, \"Oh, great.\" She did say last night, I heard her say that, \"Well, we really don't want the military in D. C.\" Well, that's not very nice, I guess. That's a little bit of a hit. But she's not as bad as some. We saved Los Angeles and all we did is get criticized by this idiot that's running the state into the ground where people are leaving. He should be thanking us and he should be requesting us to be there. And the governor of Illinois should be. Chicago is a disaster. And the governor of Illinois should say, \"President, would you do us the honor of cleaning up our city? We need help.\" They need help. They need help.\n\n(54:52)We may wait. We may or may not. We may just go in and do it, which is probably what we should do. The problem is it's not nice when you go in and do it and somebody else is standing there saying, as we give great results, say, \"Well, we don't want the military here.\" They need help badly. Chicago desperately needs help. Just look at the crime statistics. Look at the statistics that JD said about even I didn't know it was that bad. That's terrible.\n\n(55:20)But all I know is we're being celebrated because we went an entire week, now it's 11 days, we went an entire week without a murder. And I said, \"Boy, that sounds terrible.\" I actually made a speech. I didn't know how to say it, because it's a great number, it's a great thing, but it sounds so bad. I mean, supposing you're from a foreign country which is properly run and they don't have murders and things so much, or in some cases, virtually at all and you have somebody saying, \"I'm proud to announce that nobody was murdered in the capital of the United States this week.\" It sounds terrible, but…\n\nSpeaker 6 (55:59):\n\nMr. President, you've mentioned Gavin Newsom on crime.\n\nDonald Trump (56:03):\n\nGavin New-scum. Yes?\n\nSpeaker 6 (56:05):\n\nIs there a federal mechanism you're hoping to use to fight back against his redistricting constitutional amendment, or is that counter-\n\nDonald Trump (56:10):\n\nWell, I think I'm going to be filing a lawsuit pretty soon, and I think we're going to be very successful in it. We're going to be filing it through the Department of Justice. That's going to happen. And we're also going to be filing a lawsuit on blue-slipping. Blue slips make it impossible for me, as president, to appoint a judge or a U.S. attorney because they have a gentleman's agreement. It's nothing memorialized. It's a gentleman's agreement that's about 100 years old where if you have a president, like a Republican and if you have a Democrat senator, that senator can stop you from appointing a judge or a U.S. attorney in particular, those two, those are the two, I guess anything. But those are the two that are very important. So we have numerous states where we have unbelievable people.\n\n(57:01)Now, Jay Clayton was just approved in the Southern district, but he was so good. He was a top student, top schools, top everything, went to Sullivan & Cromwell, became the head of Sullivan & Cromwell, came down here with Securities and Exchange Commission, ran it for four years during my term impeccably. Beautiful job. He did an incredible job. And we went to court and the judges, Democrat judges, voted that he could. That's the only way you get by. But generally speaking, you can't do that because you'll have judges from the other party. So Jay Clayton just got approved and he's in, but he didn't get approved by the senators. He got approved by the court system in New York, which was a great thing.\n\n(57:44)And I had a big victory in New York, I might add. I saved myself $500 million with a fake corrupt attorney general, a really corrupt person with a corrupt judge who was disgraceful. And they're being mauled right now by everybody. It's so corrupt. And it kept business out of New York, stuff like that. But the appellate division vacated all of that stuff that you read about. And we're going to do a big number on that whole thing. You can't have a corrupt court system. You can't have that. You have to have borders, and you have to have a free press. Otherwise you don't have a country.\n\n(58:24)But you'll be hearing about the blue-slipping because you don't need two senators, you just need one Democrat senator with a Republican. The only person that I can get approved are Democrats or maybe weak Republicans, but we don't want that. But the only person I will be able to get approved in any of those states where you have a Democrat, I can't get a U.S. attorney, I can only get a Democrat U.S. attorney. And this is based on an old custom. It's not based on the law, and I think it's unconstitutional, and I'll probably be filing a suit on that pretty soon. Yeah, please?\n\nSpeaker 7 (59:00):\n\nDuring the campaign, you called Kamala Harris a communist, but the Biden-Harris administration, they never called for nationalizing a private company with the federal government like you're proposing with Intel. What do you say to some who say this is a bit hypocritical? And is this the new way of doing industrial policy?\n\nDonald Trump (59:18):\n\nYeah, sure it is. I want to try and get as much as I can. If people come in and they need something, as an example, as a real estate person, if I have an agreement and I have any form of a stopgap where I can stop somebody from doing something, I have a covenant in an agreement, and they come to me and they say, \"I would like to do something, but you have us restricted,\" if I do that, then you usually have to pay. Now, in the case of Intel was interesting, but I hope I'm going to have many more cases like it. Intel came in, I met with a gentleman. I had a lot of respect for him. He came in under a little bit of a cloud. I liked\n\nDonald Trump (01:00:00):\n\nThat's his story. I thought he was good. I think he really means to do a good job with Intel. I said, \"I'd like to ask whether or not you'd give,\" because [inaudible 01:00:11], a lot of people said I invested in it. I didn't invest, but I invest my heart in it and my soul because I want the country to be strong. But I said, \"I'd like you to give 10% of Intel to the United States of America, not to me, to the United States of America.\" And I said, \"If you have them as a partner, you have the United States as a partner. I think that would be a very good thing for Intel.\"\n\n(01:00:33)And he thought about it a little bit different, and he said, \"I like that idea very much. We have a deal,\" and I just made 10 billion dollars or 11 billion dollars for the United States of America. And yeah, there will be other cases. If I have that opportunity again, I would do that. And then, you do have stupid people say, \"Oh, that's a shame.\" It's not a shame. It's called business. If somebody's willing to give you 10% of a company and you're not paying for it… And I will tell you, with a company like Intel, as you know, it's had difficulty. I want them to do well. I want them to do well anyway, but I want them to do well in particular then.\n\nReporters (01:01:10):\n\nBut isn't public ownership of a private company, a new way of doing business in the business of the United States? Isn't that what you were [inaudible 01:01:19]-\n\nDonald Trump (01:01:19):\n\nSo are tariffs. So are tariffs. So as you know, the stock market went up almost 1,000 points on Friday, and it went up, not because of this very, I think terrible… Hello. Who is that back there? Get out of the room. It went up because of something much different. It went up because it was announced, CBO announced, the numbers, and as you know, they gave no credit to tariffs. They said they made a mistake, that the trade deficit will be reduced, because of Trump's tariffs, will be reduced by four trillion dollars. Right? Is that what they said? Right. They said four trillion dollars, and the market went up like a rocket ship because the tariffs are good. Well, tariffs aren't that usual. The seven wars I stopped, four of them were because of the fact that I had tariffs in trade. And I was able to say, \"Well, if you do this, if you go fight and you want to kill everybody, that's okay, but I'm going to charge you each 100% tariff when you trade with us.\"\n\n(01:02:27)You know what? They all gave up. I stopped seven wars. Numerous of them was because of tariffs. So you never knew the word tariff. It didn't exist really essentially in this country until actually in the 1870s, up until 1913, it existed. And we were the richest country. We were richer than, proportionately, than at any time in the history of our country. And then stupidly in 1913, they said, \"Let's go to the income tax way of life. Let the people pay instead of foreign countries.\" No, we're taking in trillions of dollars in tariffs, and we're stopping wars because of tariffs. So that's not so normal either. But you know what? Other countries did it to us, and now we're doing it to other countries.\n\nReporters (01:03:15):\n\n[inaudible 01:03:15] rule out boots on the ground in Ukraine. But how would air support as part of a security guarantee be any different? Those US areas-\n\nDonald Trump (01:03:24):\n\nYou really went from one question to the next. [inaudible 01:03:28]. I expected he'd at least challenge you. Now we're talking about boots on the ground.\n\nReporters (01:03:32):\n\nBut US air assets over the skies of Ukraine as part of a security guarantee, wouldn't those US airmen also be-\n\nDonald Trump (01:03:38):\n\nWell, you don't know what security guarantee is because we haven't even discussed the specifics of it. And we'll see. Number one, Europe is going to give them significant security guarantees, and they should because they're right there. But we'll be involved from the standpoint of backup. We're going to help them, and I think if we get a deal, and I think we will, but if we get a deal, I don't believe you're going to have much of a problem. But we'll back it up because I want to stop seeing people being killed. When Biden was here, he gave 350 billion dollars, you know this from covering business, 350 billion dollars to Ukraine. I said that Zelenskyy is the greatest salesman I think I've ever met, better than P.T. Barnum because he'd come to the country, he'd walk out with 50 billion dollars every time. He actually came here, once he walked out with 100 billion dollars. We're up to 350 billion. I got a trillion dollars worth of rare earth that we have from the country because I felt badly for our taxpayer. But I did something else at the NATO meeting. They are wealthy countries, but they weren't paying. And we don't pay any money to Ukraine anymore. Do you know that? In fact, it's the opposite. They request through NATO. We deal with NATO. We don't deal really with Ukraine. NATO requests missiles. They want Patriots. They want missiles. We give the missiles to NATO. NATO pays us in full and does what they want. I mean, I think they give them mostly to… They can do other things with them too. Because we're dealing with NATO. We pay no money to Ukraine. We gave 350 billion dollars to Ukraine. If we didn't give that kind of money… And I was the one that gave the Javelins, if you remember. I gave the Javelins. They were very effective.\n\n(01:05:26)They say, \"Obama gave sheets, and Trump gave Javelins.\" They were very effective with those tanks right at the beginning. But you would've never had a war if I were president. You would've never had a war. Just to finish, we spend no money on Ukraine anymore. We were getting fleeced by a president that didn't know what he was doing. To be honest, I don't blame Ukraine, I mean, if they come and ask for 100 billion dollars and they get it, but we were in for 350 billion dollars.\n\n(01:05:56)Now we make money. I don't want to make money on Ukraine. I want the war to end because I want to save all those lives. I want to just say, but just so you understand, we're no longer losing money on that thing. We were losing money hand over fist, and now, we don't lose any money. Now, we sell weapons to NATO because NATO agreed because of me to go to 5%. They had 2% and didn't pay. Now they have 5%, and they're all paid up. So they have trillions of dollars, and they give us that money. But I really want the war to end, and we're going to get it ended.\n\nReporters (01:06:29):\n\nMr. President, [inaudible 01:06:31] the work summit here with Ukrainian President Zelenskyy and European leaders all met here with you at the White House. You said you wanted to get this done bilateral as soon as possible. Have you spoken to Putin since last Monday, since [inaudible 01:06:42]-\n\nDonald Trump (01:06:42):\n\nYeah, I have.\n\nReporters (01:06:43):\n\nWhat is your conversation? Can you share?\n\nDonald Trump (01:06:46):\n\nEvery conversation I have with him is a good conversation, and then unfortunately, a bomb is loaded up into Kiev or someplace. And then I'd get very angry about it. I think we're going to get the war done. It's tough. I thought that would be, of the seven that I settled, I thought that would be the easiest of the group. See, you never know what's going to happen. You know, war, strange things happen in war. The fact that he went to Alaska, our country, I think was a big statement that he wants to get it done.\n\n(01:07:17)That was not easy for him to go to Alaska, for him to come here, but the fact that he showed up on a very successful day, that was a very successful day, for other things because we're also talking about missiles, nuclear. We're talking about a lot of different things. We're talking about limiting nuclear weapons. We'll get China into that. We have the most, Russia has the second most and China has third, but China is way behind. But they'll catch us in five years. We would like to denuclearize. It's too much power, and we talked about that also. That's part of it, but we have to get the war over with.\n\nReporters (01:08:02):\n\n[inaudible 01:07:59]. Thank you. On Baltimore, you said that you are going to have to reconsider bridge funding. Is that contingent on Wes Moore cleaning up the streets?\n\nDonald Trump (01:08:09):\n\nNo, we were very generous to him on a bridge. A boat ran into a bridge, and the bridge came down like I've never seen anything. The boat was just, it just shows you the mass of that boat, the power of that boat. People were up on that bridge. Painters, they were painting the bridge, and they were watching it happen. And they thought they were very safe. They all died. They were painting the bridge. Can you imagine? And they watched the boat. The engines were off, and they watched the boat. And the power of that boat, the mass of that boat went right through that steel just like it was nothing. It's amazing. It's called mass. Mass is a big deal, but the mass of that boat, those people all died. But they thought they were totally safe. Two of them were eating their lunch. They were whatever.\n\n(01:08:52)They were watching it. They could have gotten off. Somebody did a very good job. A police officer called in and said, \"Close the bridge,\" and he did it with power. \"Get everybody off the bridge. Close that.\" That guy should get a medal because he stopped the bridge. A lot of people would've died. A lot more people would've died. The ones that died were the workers on the bridge, and they thought there was no danger. It's a big steel bridge, and it came down like toothpicks. It was incredible to watch that, and they died. They all died, but that police officer, again, the police do a great job. The police officer did an amazing job, and I heard the tapes. He would say, \"Get everybody off it.\" Most people wouldn't have said that.\n\n(01:09:42)When you see a thing like that, you assume it's going to tap the bridge, and it's going to be rebuffed. The thing just came down. I've never seen anything like it, so he did a good job. In fact, I think we should get him in for a medal. The man that gave the warning, I listened to him, \"Everybody get off.\" Screaming, \"Everybody off.\" He had the sense to realize that this could be a catastrophe as opposed to a ship that… Because the engines weren't working, it was just floating. It's an amazing thing that a thing floating like that with no power, just knocked it right down like it was nothing. Let's do that. Let's give him a medal. I've been thinking about that.\n\nReporters (01:10:18):\n\nDo you plan to investigate Chris Christie?\n\nDonald Trump (01:10:21):\n\nSay what?\n\nReporters (01:10:23):\n\nDo you plan to investigate Chris Christie?\n\nDonald Trump (01:10:25):\n\nLook, Chris is a slob. Everybody knows it. I know Chris better than anybody in the room. I always felt he was guilty, but what he did is he took the George Washington Bridge, which is very serious, he closed down the George Washington Bridge. And you had medical people, you had ambulances caught up. This thing was closed down, and obviously, he knew about it. But he blamed the young lady that worked for him and another person, and they got into a lot of trouble. She ultimately was, I don't know, exonerated, but she got out of it a little bit. But she went through hell.\n\n(01:10:58)She was a young mother, nice person. I knew her a little bit, and another man went to jail. And Chris got off, and so, when I listened to Chris speak his hate, I say, \"Oh, what about the George Washington Bridge? Tell me about the George Washington Bridge.\" He blamed other people, but he knew all about it. So I don't know if they want to look at it, not for me, if they want to look at it, they can. You could ask Pam. I think we have other things to do, but I always thought he got away with murder.\n\nReporters (01:11:32):\n\nMr. President, are you going to make an endorsement in the Texas Senate race between Ken Paxton and John Cornyn?\n\nDonald Trump (01:11:37):\n\nWell, I'll make up my mind. I like them both. The worst situation I have is when I have two people that I get along with well. I hate it, and they all want the endorsement. 100% of the people I endorse with, it's a great honor, and I got, as you know, I got the largest vote in the history of Texas by far. Nobody's ever gotten more votes in the last election, I think in all the elections, the three elections, but they like me in Texas. So people are waiting for me, but I'd rather not comment on it right now. I like both guys. They're both friends of mine, and they're both good and very different.\n\nReporters (01:12:16):\n\nThere's some talk among congressional Republicans about another reconciliation bill. Where do you fall on that, and what would you like to prioritize?\n\nDonald Trump (01:12:22):\n\nWell, I don't want to do cutting. I want to save all the different things. I'm going to cut things that are unnecessary, but the one thing I said, and I gave my word, we're not going to hurt anybody on Medicaid, Medicare or Social Security. And in fact, we are doing great on Social Security. We found 300,000 illegals on Social Security. We got them out, and things like that make Social Security very, very strong. I am very big into certain things, and one of those three, you could say three of those things, are Medicare, Medicaid, Social Security. We're going to protect it, and so, we'll see how everything works out. If we're talking about rescissions on other things, I'm always open to cost-cutting. If we can cost-cut, I like it, but nothing's going to happen to medical. We have something coming up, favorite nations, where I'm going to be reducing drug prices by 1,400, 1,500%, where a pill that sells in Germany for $10 costs $150 here because of the bad… And I was all set to do it, and then we had the COVID come up. And I had to focus on that, because we had the greatest economy in history my first term. I will tell you that we are going to be doing numbers on the cost of drugs in this country.\n\n(01:13:43)I'm not talking about a 20% decrease, which would be great. I'm talking about 1,000% decrease. We're talking about, where a product would sell for $80 in Germany and $1,300 here, and we're not going to do that. We were subsidizing the entire world, and we're not doing it anymore. I informed the drug companies. I informed the world, and if the world wants to, if countries in the world don't want to go along, then I'm going to put tariffs on those countries. And we'll make more money, but they have to go along with it. So this is moving along rapidly. Dr. Oz is in charge, Bobby's group, and they're doing very well. And we're getting great cooperation from the drug… because the drug companies know it's unfair.\n\n(01:14:26)For years, they'd say, \"Well, we had to do research, and we had to do… \" I said, \"I don't care. You had to do research for these other countries also.\" They are ready to go, and I'm ready to go. And if I pull that off, there's no way a Republican will lose an election. There's no way. All right. One more question. Steve? Watch this guy. He's the nicest guy I know, and he asked the most vicious questions.\n\nReporters (01:14:53):\n\nWhy do you think President Putin is so reluctant to meet with President Zelenskyy?\n\nDonald Trump (01:14:57):\n\nBecause he doesn't like him. He doesn't like him. They don't like… I have people I don't like. I don't like to meet with them. Sometimes I do like to meet with people that I don't like.\n\nReporters (01:15:07):\n\nSo how do you [inaudible 01:15:08]?\n\nDonald Trump (01:15:08):\n\nThey don't like… No, they don't like each other, really. And if we had a real president instead of a guy that got in there with a fraudulent election, if we had a real president, that war would've never happened. Putin actually said, he said, \"If Trump were president, it wouldn't have happened.\" It happened for a lot of reasons. It happened because of Afghanistan. When he saw how incompetent Milley was and all these guys were, I think he said, \"Wow, this might be… \" because it was the apple of his eyes. It would've never happened if I were president.\n\nReporters (01:15:38):\n\nMr. President, you have built a relationship with Russian leaders and also North Korean leaders. As they are getting closer, how does that affect your diplomatic approach?\n\nDonald Trump (01:15:47):\n\nWell, I have very good relationships with Kim Jong Un, North Korea. I mean, a lot of people would say, \"Oh, that's terrible.\" No, it's good. In fact, someday I'll see him. I look forward to seeing him. He was very good with me. We had two meetings. We had two summits. We got along great. I know him better than you do. I know him better than anybody almost, other than his sister. His sister knows him pretty well. Now I know him well, and I got along with him. I'm not supposed to say I really like him a lot because if I do that, I get killed in the fake news media. But I got along with him very well, and we had no problem. If at the time, Hillary Clinton won the election, you would've had a nuclear war. You would've had a nuclear war. We're not going to have a nuclear war. Once that happens, it's over. We're not going to have a nuclear war. No, but Kim Jong Un, we'll meet at some point. I look forward to it actually. But do you notice that since I came into office, you haven't had a problem with him. There hasn't been. He tests lots of rockets. He does have great capability. I will say that, but I think a lot of good things, a lot of good things are happening for our country. A lot of really good things, and the thing we're here today to talk about is crime.\n\n(01:16:57)And specifically in DC, I am so proud of what these people, every one of them, what they've done in DC because to literally stop crime on a button, I'd walk down that street right now. Friends of mine are going out to dinner now. They haven't gone out to dinner in four years. They were afraid. They were petrified. Half the restaurants closed because nobody could go because they're afraid to go outside. Now those restaurants are open, and new restaurants are opening up. It's like a boom town. It's a great thing to see, and I'm very proud of the people behind me. Thank you very much, everybody. Thank you.\n\nReporters (01:17:33):\n\nThank you, guys. Thanks. Thank you, guys. Thank you. Thank you.",

    "transcript": "Donald Trump (02:04):\n\nIsn't it just… It's such an incredible place.\n\nMark Rutte (02:07):\n\nYou're building a bigger one.\n\nDonald Trump (02:08):\n\nWell, we're building a ballroom.\n\nMark Rutte (02:10):\n\nYeah.\n\nDonald Trump (02:11):\n\nBeautiful.\n\nMark Rutte (02:12):\n\nIs it going to be here?\n\nDonald Trump (02:12):\n\nRight here. If you go… It would be right through that… Right through here.\n\nPrime Minister Starmer (02:17):\n\nWell, we saw the ballroom at [inaudible 00:02:19]-\n\nDonald Trump (02:20):\n\nIt's going to be… I'll tell you about it, it's going to be fantastic actually. You can let them come in. I think we're going to have a successful talk today.\n\nPrime Minister Meloni (02:35):\n\nYeah, me too.\n\nDonald Trump (02:37):\n\nPlease, come on in. Do you guys want to take some questions or anything? [inaudible 00:02:44]?\n\nPrime Minister Meloni (02:42):\n\n[inaudible 00:02:45].\n\nDonald Trump (02:49):\n\nHi Mark.\n\nMark (02:51):\n\nGood to see you. Appreciate you.\n\nDonald Trump (02:54):\n\nYeah. Good. Well, thank you very much. It's a great honor to have you here. Special place. White House is special no matter where you're from, represents so much and it really is beautiful. And thank you for all of the wonderful things that took place today. We've had a very successful day thus far. Important discussions as we work to end the killing and stop the war in Ukraine. We're all working for the same goal. Very simple goal. We want to stop the killing, get this settled. I've just had the honor of being with President Zelenskyy and all of the discussions that we've had. We covered a lot of territory and I spoke indirectly with President Putin today. We're going to call President Putin right after this meeting. I'm sure we're going to have a solid meeting, good meeting, maybe a great meeting.\n\n(03:54)And we're going to try and work out a trilat after that and see if we can get it finished. Put this to sleep because this is… Not since the second World War, has there been anything like this. So I'm honored to welcome NATO Secretary General, Mark Rutte, who's a great gentleman, great, great political leader in Europe generally, but now he's the NATO Secretary General and you're doing a fantastic job. Thank you very much, Mark. Prime Minister Starmer of the United Kingdom, our friend and my friend, and doing really well and people like him a lot. We all like him. Everyone knows President Macron of France, who's been with me from the beginning. One of the first people I met as a foreign dignitary and I liked him from day one. And I like him even more now. That's pretty good. That's unusual. That's a pretty unusual thing.\n\n(04:56)Prime Minister Meloni of Italy, who's a really a great leader and an inspiration over there. She's served… Now even though she's a very young person, she's served there for a long period of time relative to others. They don't last very long. You've lasted a long time. You're going to be there a long time. Chancellor Merz of Germany, who is very strong person and a very strong leader and very highly respected in Germany and he's my friend and it's an honor to have him as my friend. Thank you very much. Very good. You look great with your tan. Where'd you get that tan? I want to get a tan like that [inaudible 00:05:36]. President Stubb of Finland. And he's somebody that… Where are we here? Where-\n\nPresident Stubb (05:44):\n\nI'm right here.\n\nDonald Trump (05:46):\n\nOh. You look better than I've ever seen you look.\n\nPresident Stubb (05:50):\n\nThank you.\n\nDonald Trump (05:51):\n\nBut you've done a great job and we wanted to have you here because you're somebody that we all respect and you've had a lot to do with the success I think, and the potential success. And thank you very much for being here. We appreciate it. And the president of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, who is somebody that we just made a big deal with. With all of those countries, I don't know, I think you might be more powerful than all these guys at this table. I don't know. But we had a great negotiation and you're respected all over the world. So I want to thank you very much for being here. It's a great honor to have you. The Alaska Summit reinforced my belief that while difficult pieces within reach, and I believe that in a very significant step, President Putin agreed that Russia would accept security guarantees for Ukraine.\n\n(06:43)And this is one of the key points that we need to consider and we're going to be considering that at the table also, like who will do what, essentially. I'm optimistic that, collectively, we can reach an agreement that would deter any future aggression against Ukraine. And I actually think there won't be. I think that's even largely overrated, but we're going to find out. And I think that the European nations are going to take a lot of the burden. We're going to help them and we're going to make it very secure. We also need to discuss the possible exchanges of territory taken into consideration. The current line of contact, that means the war zone, the war lines that are pretty obvious, very sad actually to look at them and negotiating positions. President Putin, also you have president of Ukraine who is. You just met a little while ago and we're going to try and get a three-party meeting maybe as soon as we can.\n\n(07:47)And I have a feeling you and President Putin are going to work something out. Ultimately, this is a decision that can only be made by President Zelenskyy and by the people of Ukraine working also together in agreement with President Putin. And I just think that's a… Very good things that are going to come of it. So I hope we have a good meeting, and if we can have a good meeting, I'll set up a meeting with President Putin, and if you'd like, I'll go to that meeting. Not that I want to do that, but I will do that because we want to save a lot of people from dying. A lot of people are dying and we got to save them. Got to save it. 5,000, 6,000, 7,000 people sometimes a week. All of us would obviously prefer an immediate cease fire while we work on a lasting piece and maybe something like that could happen.\n\n(08:34)As of this moment, it's not happening. But President Zelenskyy and President Putin can talk a little bit more about that. And the six or so wars that we stopped, we haven't had a ceasefire. And so I don't know that it's necessary. You can do it through the war, but it would be… I like the ceasefire from another standpoint, you immediately stop the killing. But I believe a peace agreement at the end of all of this is something that's very attainable and it can be done in the near future. With all of the wars that I got involved in, we only have this one left. Of course, as I walk out the door, there'll probably be a new one starting and I'll get that stopped too. But I thought this was going to be one of the easier ones. It's actually one of the most difficult. They're very complex.\n\n(09:23)The next step would be for a trilateral meeting and that will be worked out and I just look forward to working and having a great result. We're going to spend a lot of time today talking about… And we're really honored you guys came over. I mean, these are the heads of major countries and respected all over Europe and they speak for, largely, I think I should say, but pretty much for the other countries of Europe. And we will come to a resolution today, I think, on almost everything, including probably the security. And that's pretty much the story. I'd like to say, Mr. President, would you like to say something? You have the media. If you want, you could come over and you could stand --. You could use mine or you could just turn around whichever you feel comfortable with.\n\nPresident Zelenskyy (10:12):\n\nThanks so much. I can speak without microphone. Thank you so much. I think that we had very good conversation with President Trump.\n\nDonald Trump (10:20):\n\nVery good.\n\nPresident Zelenskyy (10:21):\n\nAnd it really was the best one. Or sorry, maybe the best one will be in the future, but it was really good and we spoke about very sensitive points. The first one is security guarantees. And we are very happy with President that all the leaders are here. The security in Ukraine depends on the United States and on you and on those leaders who are with us in our hearts, they have been online before yesterday and et cetera. So a lot of countries on the side of Ukraine, our people, and all of us want to finish this war, stop Russia and stop this war. We spoke about it and we will speak more about security guarantees.\n\n(11:03)This is very important that United States gives such strong signal and is ready for security guarantees. The second point or maybe the first humanitarian direction, very important to exchange all the prisoners and I think that President will help. And I was very thankful to your wife, again, Mr. President, for the letter about our abducted children. And I hope that really it can be historic role for the people to bring kids back to the families and be happy. The families-\n\nDonald Trump (11:40):\n\nPeople back. Yeah.\n\nPresident Zelenskyy (11:41):\n\nYes. This is so, so important and I'm happy that we discussed it, this [inaudible 00:11:46] with President Trump, and I hope that we will find decisions. And then what is very important that all the sensitive things, territorial, et cetera, we will discuss on the level of leaders during trilateral meeting and President Trump will try to organize such meeting and he said that he will come or not come. Ukraine will be happy if you participate.\n\nDonald Trump (12:13):\n\nIf you both want to be there, I will be there. Yeah.\n\nPresident Zelenskyy (12:18):\n\nThank you. And I think this is very important. Yes. So security guarantees bringing kids back and all our people, not only warriors. First of all warriors and all the civilians, journalists, a lot of people in prison. So we need them back. And guarantees which will work for the years, we spoke about it, and I showed the president a lot of details on the battlefield, on the map. Thank you so much. Thank you for the map by the way.\n\nDonald Trump (12:47):\n\nGood map.\n\nPresident Zelenskyy (12:48):\n\nIt was great. Yeah. I'm thinking how to take it back.\n\nDonald Trump (12:52):\n\nWe'll get you-\n\nPresident Zelenskyy (12:52):\n\nNo, no, no. I think that we had constructive specific meeting and we're thankful to all the leaders who are here and you help a lot. And so we're happy that we have such big unity today. Thank you, Mr. President.\n\nDonald Trump (13:10):\n\nThank you very much, Mr. President. I think you'll see that President Putin really would like to do something else. I think when we set that up… When we do… I think it's going to be when, not if. I think you're going to see some really positive moves. I know there's over a thousand prisoners and I know they're going to release them. Maybe they're going to release them very soon, like immediately, which I think is great. But we are going to set that up today after this meeting. So very good and great remarks. I appreciate it. Mark is head of NATO, maybe you could say a few words please.\n\nMark Rutte (13:45):\n\nYes, I will be very brief. I really want to thank you, President of the United States, dear Donald, for the fact that you, as I said before, broke the deadlock, basically, with President Putin by starting that dialogue. And I think it was in February that you had the first phone call. And from there, we are now where we are today. And that is… I think if we play this well, we could end this and we have to end this. We have to stop the killing. We have to stop the destruction of Ukraine's infrastructure. It is a terrible war. So I'm really excited and let's make the best out of today and make sure that from today onwards, we get this thing to an end as soon as possible. I really want to thank you for your leadership, what you are doing, Volodymyr, but of course also all the European colleagues, it is really crucial. And the fact that you have said, \"I'm willing to participate in the security guarantees,\" is a big step. It's really a breakthrough and it makes all the difference. So also thank you for that.\n\nDonald Trump (14:42):\n\nWell NATO also has agreed from 2% to 5%, which is something that is a massive amount of money and it's 2% that wasn't always paid to 5% that is paid. That's a big difference. And so we appreciate that. That was a great move. Thank you very much. Ursula, maybe on behalf of the commission, you could say a couple of words.\n\nUrsula von der Leyen (15:01):\n\nYes. Thank you very much. It's a pleasure to be here. It's a very important moment. Indeed, we are here, Europeans, as friends and allies. We had a fantastic NATO summit together as the two largest and biggest economies in the world. We had the largest trade deal ever.\n\nDonald Trump (15:19):\n\nThat's right.\n\nUrsula von der Leyen (15:20):\n\nAgreed. And now we are here to work together with you on a just and lasting piece for Ukraine, stop the killing. This is really our common interest. Stop the killing. And indeed, it's very good to hear that we're working on the security guarantees. Article 5 [inaudible 00:15:36] security guarantees, so important. But I want to thank you also that you mentioned the thousands of Ukrainian children that have been abducted. And as a mother and grandmother, every single child has to go back to its family. This should be one of our main priorities also in these negotiations to make sure that the children come back to Ukraine, to their families.\n\nDonald Trump (16:00):\n\nThank you. And we did, I was just thinking we're here for a different reason, but we just a couple of weeks ago made the largest trade deal in history. So that's a big thing. And congratulations. That's great. Thank you very much, Ursula. Mr. Chancellor from Germany, a very, very great leader.\n\nChancellor Merz (16:20):\n\nMr. President, dear Donald, many thanks for having us today. I think this is extremely helpful that we are meeting and hearing that the two of you are having such a good meeting today here in Washington. The next steps ahead are the more complicated ones now. The path is open. You opened it last Friday, but now the way is open for complicated negotiations. And to be honest, we all would like to see a ceasefire, the latest from the next meeting on. I can't imagine that the next meeting would took place without a ceasefire. So let's work on that and let's try to put pressure on Russia because the credibility of these efforts we are undertaking today are depending on at least a cease fire from the beginning of the serious negotiations from next step on. So I would like to emphasize this aspect and would like to see a ceasefire from the next meeting, which should be a trilateral meeting, wherever it take place.\n\nDonald Trump (17:29):\n\nWell, we're going to let the president go over and talk to the president and we'll see how that works out and if we can do that. I will say, and again, I say it in the six wars that I've settled, I haven't had a ceasefire, we just got into negotiations and they… One of the wars was, as you know, in the Congo, was 31 years long. Another one that we settled last week with two great countries was 35 years going on and we had no ceasefire. So if we can do the ceasefire, great, and if we don't do a ceasefire… Because many other points were given to us, many, many points were given to us. Great points. Please, Giorgia. Go ahead.\n\nPrime Minister Meloni (18:13):\n\nWell, thank you very much, Donald, Mr. President, for hosting us today in this important meeting. And I think it is an important day, a new phase after three years and half that we didn't see any kind of sign from the Russian side that there was a willing for dialogue. So something is changing. Something has changed thanks to you. Thanks also to the stalling in the battlefield, which was achieved with the bravery of Ukrainians and with the unity that we all provided to Ukraine. And the reason why I mention it is that we also have to remind that if we want to reach peace and if we want to guarantee justice, we have to do it united. So that's why it's a very good day, the one we are in. You can obviously count on Italy as it was from the beginning. We are on the side of Ukraine and we do absolutely support your efforts towards peace.\n\n(19:18)We will talk about many important topics. The first one is security guarantees, how to be sure that it won't happen again, which is the precondition of every kind of piece. I'm happy that we will discuss about that. I'm happy that we will begin from a proposal which is the, let's say, Article 5 model, which was Italian at the beginning. So we are always ready to bring our proposals for peace, for dialogue. It's something we have to build together to guarantee peace and to defend the security of our nation's soul. Thank you, Mr. President, for hosting us.\n\nDonald Trump (19:57):\n\nThank you very much Emmanuel.\n\nPresident Macron (20:01):\n\nThank you, Mr. President, for organizing this meeting and for your commitment. And everything was said, but I just have to say here, everybody around this table is in favor of peace and we work very hard and we've worked very hard during the past few years to have a piece which is a robust and long-standing peace. This is why the idea of a trilateral meeting is very important because this is the only way to fix it. And by the way, I think as a follow-up, we would need probably a quadrilateral meeting because when we speak about security guarantees, we speak about the whole security of the European continent. And this is why we are all united here with Ukraine on this matter. In order to organize such a trilateral meeting, your idea to ask for a truce or at least to stop the killings as we discussed, is a necessity.\n\n(20:59)And we all support this idea. And in order to have such a longstanding peace for Ukraine and for the whole continent, we do need the security guarantees. And the first one is clearly a credible Ukrainian army for the years and decades to come. And the second one is our own commitment to all of us. And we worked very hard during the past few months among the coalition of the willings, with the support of NATO, to build the different pillars of security guarantees and our commitments. And you can be sure that the Europeans are very lucid about the fact that they have their fair share in this security guarantees for Ukraine, but their own security is clearly at stake in the situation. So you can count on us as we can count on you in order to deliver this robust peace for both Ukraine and Europe. Thank you.\n\nDonald Trump (21:52):\n\nThank you very much, Emmanuel. Mr. Minister.\n\nPrime Minister Starmer (21:56):\n\nThank you very much, Mr. President, and thank you for hosting us here. Can I start where Emmanuel started, which is we all want peace. The war in Ukraine has had a huge impact, particularly on the Ukrainians who borne the brunt of it, but it's also had an impact on Europe and on the United Kingdom. There's not a family or community that hasn't been affected. And when we talk about security, we're talking about the security, not just of Ukraine, we're talking about the security of Europe and the United Kingdom as well, which is why this is such an important issue. I think this is such an important meeting. As a group, I think we've had a discussion on the phone a number of times, Mr. President, but be able now to be around the table to take it forward.\n\n(22:37)And I really feel that we can, I think, with the right approach this afternoon make real progress particularly on the security guarantees and your indication of security guarantees of some sort of Article 5 style guarantees fits with what we've been doing with the coalition of the willing, which we started some months ago, bringing countries together and showing that we were prepared to step up to the plate when it came to security. With you coming alongside, the US alongside what we've already developed, I think we could take a really important step forward today. A historic step, actually, could come out at this meeting in terms of security for Ukraine and security in Europe.\n\n(23:16)I also feel that we can make real progress towards a just and lasting outcome. Obviously, that has to involve Ukraine and a trilateral meeting seems the sensible next step. So thank you for being prepared to take that forward because I think if we can ensure that that is the progress out of this meeting, both security guarantees and some sort of progress on trilateral meeting of some sort, to bring some of the difficult issues to a head, then I think today will be seen as a very important day in recent years in relation to a conflict, which has gone on for three and a bit years, and so far nobody's been able to bring it to this point. So I thank you for that.\n\nDonald Trump (24:03):\n\nWell, thank you very much. And it's very interesting because this is the first for the White House. You can't say that very often. It's seen a lot over the years, over the… Since 1800, 1799 to be almost exact. But this is the first where we've had so many prime ministers, presidents, the heads of European nations. And by the way, Alex, I'd like you to say a couple of words too. You're a young powerful man. Before I finish up, I want you to say a couple of words. Go ahead.\n\nPresident Stubb (24:35):\n\nI'll take the notion of youth back to my wife and try to convince her. Thank you very much, Mr. President. I think in the past two weeks we've probably had more progress in ending this war than we have in the past three and a half years. And I think the fact that we are around this table today is very much symbolic in the sense that it's team Europe and team United States helping Ukraine. And the progress that we're looking out of this meeting is about the security guarantees, which are a big part of this. And then, of course, moving towards a process with the trilateral meeting with you and President Putin and President Zelenskyy.\n\n(25:19)Some of the international media might wonder, \"Why is the president of Finland here?\" I think the reason is probably that we might come from a small country, but we have a long border with Russia, over 800 miles, and we, of course, have our own historical experience with Russia from World War II, the Winter War and the War of Continuation. And if I look at the silver lining of where we stand right now, we found a solution in 1944. And I'm sure that we'll be able to find a solution in 2025 to end Russia's war of aggression and find and get a lasting and just piece. The situation is very difficult. But that's why we're here.\n\nDonald Trump (26:03):\n\nThank you, Alex. Very much. Good job. So we're going to be meeting for a while and we're going to discuss some of the issues and I don't think there's any issue that's overly complex. It's at a point now where people want to do things. I really do believe, I've known him for a long time, I've always had a great relationship with him. I think that President Putin wants to find an answer too. And we'll see in a certain period of time, not very far from now, a week or two weeks, we're going to know whether or not we're going to solve this or is this horrible fighting going to continue. We'll do the best to get it ended. And I believe you have two willing parties and usually that's good news, but two willing parties that want to make a deal, and we'll journey together and we'll go over and we'll see if it could be done.\n\n(26:54)And it's possible it might not be able to be done. On the other hand, it's possible it will. And we're going to save thousands and thousands of lives a week. And so it's something we really have to do. Or at least we have to give it our best. That's all you can do. You can give it your best. But I think we may have a very good outcome. So I want to thank you all, and the media, I want to thank you. We're going to be staying here for a little while, then we're going to walk over to the Oval Office and we're going to have another little discussion about similar matters and then they're going to go home to their great countries and report.\n\n(27:29)And I'm going to remain here and work. And you're going to go and work. We're all going to be working one… We may be in a different location, but that's what we know how to do, is work. But I want to thank… The media's been actually very fair, generally speaking. Very fair. I think it's important that they're fair because this is a very important subject. We have to get it ended. And so that's all we ask for, is fairness with the media. Thank you all very much. We appreciate it. Thank you very much.",

It's an honor to have the president of Ukraine with us. We've had a lot of good discussions, a lot of good talks, and I think progress is being made, very substantial progress in many ways. We had a good meeting, as you know, just a short while ago with the president of Russia, and I think there's a possibility that something could come out of it. And today's meeting is very important. We have, I guess, the seven very powerful leaders from Europe, and we're going to be meeting with them right after this meeting. And thank you very much for being here.\n\nVolodymyr Zelenskyy (03:32):\n\nThank you so much, Mr. President. If I can, first of all-\n\nDonald Trump (03:35):\n\nPlease.\n\nVolodymyr Zelenskyy (03:35):\n\n… thank you for the invitation. Thank you very much for your efforts, personal efforts to stop killings and stop this war. Thank you. And using this opportunity, many thanks to your wife, the first lady of the United States. She sent a letter to Putin about our children, abducted children. And my wife, first lady of Ukraine, she gave the letter.\n\nDonald Trump (04:00):\n\nOh, that's very nice.\n\nVolodymyr Zelenskyy (04:01):\n\nIt's not to you, to your wife.\n\nDonald Trump (04:02):\n\nOh, I want it. I want it.\n\nVolodymyr Zelenskyy (04:07):\n\nYeah, yeah, yeah. So, we are saying this sensitive topic. Yes, please. And thanks to our partners and that you supported this format, that after our meeting, we can have leaders who are around us, UK and France, Germany, Finland, EU, NATO, I mean all partners around Ukraine supporting us. Thanks them, and thank you very much for the invitation.\n\nDonald Trump (04:30):\n\nThank you very much for being here.\n\nReporters (04:32):\n\nPresident Trump?\n\n(04:32)Do you think it's fair-\n\nDonald Trump (04:36):\n\nYes, Peter, go ahead.\n\nReporters (04:36):\n\nThank you, President Trump. So, President Zelenskyy, you say in a post on X today, \"Russia must end this war, which it itself started.\" President Trump, you say, \"President Zelenskyy of Ukraine can end the war with Russia almost immediately if he wants to.\" Which is it?\n\nDonald Trump (04:56):\n\nYeah, I think that's true. I think we're going to have a meeting. I think if everything works out well today, we'll have a trilat, and I think there will be a reasonable chance of ending the war when we do that.\n\nReporters (05:07):\n\nAnd is this the end of the road for American support for Ukraine? Is today's meeting deal or no deal?\n\nDonald Trump (05:16):\n\nI can never say that. It's never the end of the road. People are being killed and we want to stop that. So, I would not say it's the end of the road. No, I think we have a good chance of doing it. It's been almost four years now that… A lot of people were killed last week. A lot of people last week. Millions of people killed, but a lot of people last week for whatever reason, a big number. A lot of soldiers, on both sides. And I know the president, I know myself, and I believe Vladimir Putin wants to see it ended.\n\nReporters (05:46):\n\nAnd as you met with Putin on Friday, today you've got President Zelenskyy here, as you listen to Russia and Ukraine, which side has the better cards?\n\nDonald Trump (05:55):\n\nWell, I don't want to say that. I'm just here to be… Look, this isn't my war, this is Joe Biden's war. He's the one that had a lot to do with this happening. And we want to get it ended and we want it to end good for everybody. We want it to end good. The people of Ukraine have suffered incredibly.\n\nReporters (06:12):\n\nMr. President?\n\n(06:12)Mr. President?\n\n(06:12)Mr. President?\n\n(06:12)President Zelenskyy?\n\n(06:12)President Zelenskyy, are you prepared to keep sending Ukrainian troops to their deaths for another couple years or are you going to agree to redraw the maps?\n\nVolodymyr Zelenskyy (06:26):\n\nThank you for your question. So, first of all, we live under each day attacks. You know that today have been a lot of attacks and a lot of wounded people. And a child was dead, small one, one year and a half. So, we need to stop this war to stop Russia, and we need support, American and European partners. We'll do our best for this. And I think we show that we are strong people and we supported the idea of the United States, personally of President Trump, to stop this war, to make a diplomatic way of finishing this war. And we are ready for trilateral, as President said. This is a good signal about trilateral. I think this is very good. Thank you.\n\nReporters (07:20):\n\nMr. President, [inaudible 00:07:20].\n\n(07:20)[inaudible 00:07:20].\n\n(07:20)Mr. President, if the peace deal will be achieved-\n\nDonald Trump (07:20):\n\nGo ahead.\n\nReporters (07:22):\n\nYes. If the peace deal will be achieved, are you going to be willing to send American peacekeepers to Ukraine?\n\nDonald Trump (07:27):\n\nWe're going to work with Ukraine, we're going to work with everybody, and we're going to make sure that if there's peace, the peace is going to stay long term. This is very long term. We're not talking about a two-year peace and then we end up in this mess again. We're going to make sure that everything's good. We'll work with Russia, we're going to work with Ukraine, and we're going to make sure it works. And I think if we can get to peace, it's going to work. I have no doubt about it.\n\nReporters (07:50):\n\nMr. President, what security guarantees-\n\n(07:50)Mr. President, [inaudible 00:07:51].\n\nDonald Trump (07:50):\n\nPlease, go ahead.\n\nReporters (07:55):\n\nYour team has talked about security guarantees. Could that involve US troops? Would you rule that out in the future?\n\nDonald Trump (08:00):\n\nWe'll let you know that maybe later today. We're meeting with seven great leaders of great countries also. And we'll be talking about that. They'll all be involved, but there'll be a lot of help. When it comes to security, there's going to be a lot of help. It's going to be good. They are first line of defense because they're there, they're Europe. But we're going to help them out also, we'll be involved. Yes?\n\nReporters (08:25):\n\n[inaudible 00:08:24].\n\n(08:25)Mr. Trump, Mr. President, Vladimir Putin mentioned that the war will not end without addressing the root causes of this war. Have you had an understanding what are the root causes of this war?\n\nDonald Trump (08:38):\n\nWell, look, the war is going to end. When it ends, I can't tell you. But the war is going to end, and this gentleman wants it to end and Vladimir Putin wants it to end. I think the whole world is tired of it and we're going to get it ended. I've done six wars, I've ended six wars, and I thought this maybe would be the easiest one. And it's not the easiest one. It's a tough one. A lot of reasons for it. And they'll be talking about it for a long time. But they'll be talking about the others.\n\n(09:10)Look, India, Pakistan, we're talking about big places. You just take a look at some of these wars. You go to Africa and take a look at that. Rwanda and the Congo, Republic of the Congo. That's been going on for 31 years. And so we've done a total of six and we really have six, not including the fact that we obliterated and it turned out to be a total obliteration, the nuclear in, as you said, the future nuclear capability of Iran. And this one, I think we're going to get solved also. I think I feel confident we're going to get it solved.\n\nReporters (09:53):\n\n[inaudible 00:09:49].\n\n(09:53)Thanks, Mr. President. Can you tell us about your conversations with European leaders, and what they need to see to support an end to the war?\n\nDonald Trump (10:01):\n\nYeah, well, we're going to be meeting with a great representative group and seven very powerful, very big countries and great people. All friends of mine and friends of yours. And we're going to have some suggestions made. They want to see peace, they would like to see peace.\n\nReporters (10:18):\n\nPresident Zelenskyy!\n\n(10:18)Mr. President!\n\n(10:18)[inaudible 00:10:20].\n\n(10:18)When is Russia… When is Russia-\n\nDonald Trump (10:18):\n\nGo ahead, please.\n\nReporters (10:18):\n\nYou said last night that-\n\nDonald Trump (10:18):\n\nIn the red. In the red.\n\nReporters (10:25):\n\nPresident Trump, do you think it's fair for Ukraine and for Russia to achieve a lasting and durable peace if Ukraine cedes its territories that Russia hasn't yet conquered? Do you think it's a fair peace for Ukraine?\n\nDonald Trump (10:42):\n\nWe're going to have a lasting peace. Just to answer the first part of your question, we're going to have a lasting peace. I hope it's going to be immediately. I hope it doesn't have to go on. And I think people of the whole world is going to be very happy when that's announced. Please.\n\nReporters (10:56):\n\n[inaudible 00:10:56].\n\n(10:56)Mr. President? You posted on social media, Mr. President, a very touching letter from the first lady, and the letter was hand-delivered to President Putin. And it calls for an end to the war, essentially, because of the children, the children's future. Why did the first lady feel that letter was necessary? Was it because she believes that Mr. Putin is the aggressor in the war? Is a similar letter being hand-delivered to President Zelenskyy?\n\nDonald Trump (11:23):\n\nSo, the first lady felt very strongly. She's watched the same thing that you watch and that I watch. I see things that you don't get to see and it's horrible. But she's got a great love of children, she has a wonderful son that she loves probably more than anybody, including me, I hate to say it. But she loves her son, she loves children, and she hates to see something like this happening. And that goes for other wars, too. She sees the heartbreak, the parents, the funerals that you see on television, always funerals. We want to see something other than funerals. No, she felt… It was a beautiful letter. It was very well received by him. And she did ask me to say she would love to see this end. She would love to see it end. And she says it very openly, very proudly, and with great sorrow, because so many people have been killed.\n\nReporters (12:24):\n\nMr. President?\n\n(12:24)[inaudible 00:12:25].\n\n(12:24)Mr. President, last week, last week, Mr. President-\n\nDonald Trump (12:26):\n\nBrian, go ahead, Brian.\n\nReporters (12:27):\n\nYes, sir. I've got a question for each of you.\n\nDonald Trump (12:29):\n\nYes?\n\nReporters (12:29):\n\nFirst of all, Mr. President Zelenskyy, you look fabulous in that suit.\n\nDonald Trump (12:32):\n\nI said the same thing.\n\nReporters (12:33):\n\nYou look good.\n\nDonald Trump (12:35):\n\nI said the same thing. Isn't that nice? That's the one that attacked you last time. See? Now-\n\nVolodymyr Zelenskyy (12:39):\n\nI remember that.\n\nReporters (12:40):\n\nI apologize to you, but you look wonderful. No, my first question for you, President Zelenskyy-\n\nVolodymyr Zelenskyy (12:44):\n\nBut you are in the same suit. See, I changed, you have not.\n\nReporters (12:46):\n\nMaybe yours is much better than mine.\n\nVolodymyr Zelenskyy (12:53):\n\nPlease.\n\nReporters (12:53):\n\nReal quickly, upon peace, God willing, we get peace, are you open to holding an election in your country?\n\nVolodymyr Zelenskyy (13:00):\n\nYes, of course. We're open for election, yes. We have to do safety circumstances. And a little bit, we need to work in the parliament, because during the war you can't have elections. But we can do security. We need, maybe… How to say? We need a truce, yes, everywhere. In the battlefield, in the sky, in the sea, to make possible for people to do democratic, open, legal elections.\n\nDonald Trump (13:29):\n\nSo, you say during the war you can't have elections. So, let me just say, three and a half years from now… So, you mean if we happen to be in a war with somebody, no more elections? Oh, that's good. I wonder what the fake news would say?\n\nVolodymyr Zelenskyy (13:45):\n\nYou like this idea?\n\nDonald Trump (13:45):\n\nNo, no, he said it, not me.\n\nVolodymyr Zelenskyy (13:45):\n\nOh, no, no.\n\nReporters (13:48):\n\nSpeaking of news, I got a question for you. This sounds insane for me even to ask this, but do you think the American media really doesn't even want a peace deal? Because we've seen, they've been so critical of you every step of the way as you lead the charge for peace.\n\nDonald Trump (14:03):\n\nIt's an amazing phenomena. I said that if, in the settlement, you got Moscow, St. Petersburg, and thousands of miles around them, they would say I made a bad deal. The level of hatred and animosity is incredible. Not with all. We have great people up here. We also have terrible people up there that I think are told what to say. But in solving all of these wars, they don't even write about it. I solve major wars. I solve wars that have been going on for 31, 35, and 37, and a couple of quicker ones. One that was going to go into a full-blown deal very quickly, you know the one I'm talking about, it was a big one. But they don't even write about that.\n\n(14:49)No matter what I do, no matter what, and this is not anything to do with you, it's probably to your advantage, in a certain way. But no matter what I do, no matter what deal I make, from my standpoint, you'll come out good. Maybe President Putin will come out good. But they'll say, \"Trump was absolutely horrible.\" And I've lived with that for a long time. I've lived with it since just before the first election. I used to get great publicity. Now I get the worst publicity anyone's ever gotten in office. But I won in a landslide. So, the people understand. They're the only ones that count, ultimately. But I've also had great reporters. I've had journalists that are very good. But it's very sad when you do the right thing.\n\n(15:37)As an example, they said because of the fact that Vladimir Putin came to American soil, this was a tremendous defeat for Donald Trump. No, it was really wonderful that he did it. It was a hard thing for him to do, to be honest with you. It was the opposite of what they said. But they said it. Now, if he didn't come, they'd say that was also bad for Trump. There's no way. And there's just a great dishonesty of the press. And I think that's why it's lost its credibility. Its credibility is at an all-time low.\n\n(16:11)We have a thing going on right now in D.C. We went from the most unsafe place anywhere to a place that now people, friends are calling me up. Democrats are calling me up and they're saying, \"Sir, I want to thank you. My wife and I went out to dinner last night for the first time in four years, and Washington, D.C. is safe. And you did that in four days.\" I'll tell you it's safe. I had another friend of mine, he has a son who's a great golfer, he's on tour, and he came in fourth yesterday in the big tournament where Scottie Scheffler made the great shot. And he said his son is going to dinner in Washington, D.C. tonight. I said, \"Would you have allowed that to happen a year ago?\" He said, \"No way. No way.\" He said, \"What you've done is incredible.\"\n\n(16:59)And I think the people realize it, but the press says, \"He's a dictator. He's trying to take over.\" No. All I want is security for our people. But people that haven't gone out to dinner in Washington, D.C. in two years are going out to dinner. And the restaurants the last two days were busier than they've been in a long time. Thank you.\n\nReporters (17:19):\n\nMr. President-\n\n(17:19)Sir, I walked around yesterday with MTG. If you can walk around with D.C. with MTG and not be attacked, the city is safe.\n\nDonald Trump (17:26):\n\nYes!\n\nReporters (17:26):\n\n[inaudible 00:17:27].\n\nDonald Trump (17:26):\n\nGo ahead.\n\nReporters (17:30):\n\nThank you, Mr. President. Last week, you warned of what you called \"severe consequences\" if a 30-day ceasefire, or any type of ceasefire, were not agreed to by Russia. Will there be severe consequences? Does that change because of the meeting with President Putin?\n\nDonald Trump (17:44):\n\nI don't think you need a ceasefire, you know? If you look at the six deals that I settled this year, they were all at war. I didn't do any ceasefires. And I know that it might be good to have, but I can also understand strategically why one country or the other wouldn't want it. You have a ceasefire and they rebuild and rebuild and rebuild, and maybe they don't want that. But if you look at the six deals that we made peace? Long-term, long-running wars, I didn't do any ceasefires. Would I like… I like the concept. I like the concept of a ceasefire for one reason, because you stop killing people immediately, as opposed to in two weeks or one week or whatever it takes. But we can work a deal where we're working on a peace deal while they're fighting. They have to fight. I wish they could stop, I'd like them to stop. But strategically, that could be a disadvantage for one side or the other. But all of these deals I made without even the mention of the words \"cease fire\".\n\nReporters (18:45):\n\nBut President-\n\n(18:45)[inaudible 00:18:46].\n\n(18:45)President Zelenskyy, are you disappointed that there's no ceasefire?\n\n(18:46)Can you explain the decision to offer Ukraine Article 5-like security guarantees, but stop short of pushing for their full membership?\n\nDonald Trump (18:56):\n\nYeah, well, we haven't done anything on that yet. If you look back and you go back long before President Putin, it was always a statement that they would never allow Ukraine into NATO. So, that was a statement that was made, but we haven't discussed any of that yet. We're going to be discussing it today. But we will give them very good protection, very good security. That's part of it. And the people that are waiting for us, I think they're very like-minded. They want to help out also.\n\nReporters (19:21):\n\n[inaudible 00:19:22].\n\n(19:21)Are you disappointed there's no ceasefire? Are you disappointed there's no ceasefire?\n\n(19:21)Mr. President, they're saying they want to do… Thank you. Thank you, President Trump.\n\n(19:27)Are you disappointed there's no ceasefire, Mr. President?\n\n(19:29)The United States has already given hundreds of billions of dollars to this war effort in Ukraine.\n\nDonald Trump (19:34):\n\nBiden.\n\nReporters (19:34):\n\nAt best, it is a stalemate and the killing continues. So, President Trump, how much more is the United States willing to give Ukraine? And President Zelenskyy, how much more do you want?\n\nDonald Trump (19:46):\n\nWell, I'll start off just by saying we're not giving anything now. We're selling weapons. This is something before… I guess the number's well over $300 billion. That was under Joe Biden, a corrupt politician. Not a smart man, never was. By the way, go back 40 years, he was not a smart man 40 years ago either. But now he's in particular bad. This was done by a corrupt administration that shouldn't have been in. And frankly, if the right results of the election were given, if I were president, this war would've never taken place. And he would've been very happy because he would've liked to have seen… I mean, they went through hell. He went through hell. This war would've never happened. And the people that were killed, a couple of million people, a lot of people with soldiers and everything else, and the people that have been displaced and forced into other areas and other countries because of what's happened, none of that would've happened. And I'm just saying that he was a horrible president. Whether it was the borders or this, he was just a horrible, corrupt president.\n\nReporters (20:52):\n\nMr. President?\n\n(20:53)[inaudible 00:20:53].\n\nDonald Trump (20:54):\n\nDo you want to answer that?\n\nVolodymyr Zelenskyy (20:59):\n\nI can, thanks so much. So, first of all, we have possibility now to buy weapon from the United States. We're thankful for this program and this opportunity. We're thankful for Europe. They pay for this and through NATO program, for example, and et cetera, we have some programs where we can have some money to finance this. And this is a part, I think. It's not a part for the world and to defend us. It's also will be a part for security guarantees to strengthen our army, to rearm Ukrainian army. This is very, very important. And it depends how much money we need to rearm. For example, the question of air defense, we spoke about it with President Trump, and I'm happy that we have now bilateral decisions and we work on it with production, American production. Nobody in Europe has so many air defense like Patriots, for example. We need it very much. And this is also about defending.\n\nReporters (21:54):\n\nPresident Zelenskyy-\n\n(21:54)[inaudible 00:21:54].\n\nDonald Trump (21:57):\n\nAnd I think the good news, we make the best military equipment in the world by far. You mentioned the Patriots. How good are they?\n\nVolodymyr Zelenskyy (22:02):\n\nYeah, systems.\n\nDonald Trump (22:03):\n\nWe have systems, they're literally 100% foolproof. And it's really like shooting two bullets, two bullets hitting each other in the air, in a space like this. The chances? 100%. It's 99 to 100%. So, we sell the equipment to NATO, and NATO does what? I don't know what the arrangement is that you have with… But I know that they want you to have the equipment. And we're getting the best equipment in the world, but they pay us for the equipment. Under Biden, it was just crazy what was going on. I believe the number is over $300, I think it could be $350 billion worth of equipment and money and everything else. And we've made more progress in settling this war in the last two months than they made in four years. This should have been settled a long time ago, but it should have never happened. Yeah, please.\n\nReporters (22:54):\n\nMr. President-\n\n(22:54)[inaudible 00:22:55].\n\n(22:56)You pushed out on social media-\n\n(22:57)Was there any-\n\nDonald Trump (22:59):\n\nBrian, go first.\n\nReporters (22:59):\n\nYou pushed out on social media about doing away with mail-in ballots and potentially electronic voting machines. Can you explain on that, how important-\n\nDonald Trump (23:07):\n\nWell, that's a very off-topic… Just really quickly.\n\nReporters (23:10):\n\nSorry.\n\nDonald Trump (23:10):\n\nMail-in ballots are corrupt. You can never have a real democracy with mail-in ballots. And we as a Republican Party are going to do everything possible that we get rid of mail-in ballots. We're going to start with an executive order that's being written right now by the best lawyers in the country to end mail-in ballots, because they're corrupt. And do you know that we're the only country in the world, I believe, I may be wrong, but just about the only country in the world that uses them? Because of what's happened, massive fraud all over the place.\n\n(23:44)The other thing we want changed are the machines. For all of the money they spend, it's approximately 10 times more expensive than paper ballots. And paper ballots are very sophisticated, with the watermark paper and everything else. We would get secure elections, we'd get much faster results. The machines, they say we're going to have the results in two weeks. With paper ballots, you have the results that night. Many countries use paper ballots. It's the most secure form. So, between paper ballots, very important, paper ballots, and I think maybe even more important, the mail-in voting, we're going to end mail-in voting. It's a fraud. If you have mail-in… Even Jimmy Carter, with this commission, they set it up. He said the one thing about mail-in voting, you will never have an honest election if you have mail-in.\n\n(24:36)And it's time that the Republicans get tough and stop it, because the Democrats want it. It's the only way they can get elected because with men and women's sports, and with transgender for everybody, and open borders, and all of the horrible things, and now the new thing is they love crime. They're fighting me on the fact that I've made Washington, D.C. safe. We're not going to get mugged, beaten up, or killed, like all the people you've been watching get so badly hurt. I'm glad. I hate to take your time with this, but I'm glad you asked me that question.\n\nReporters (25:10):\n\nSorry.\n\nDonald Trump (25:11):\n\nWe're going to stop mail-in ballots because it's corrupt. When you go to a voting booth and you do it the right way and you go to a state that runs it properly, you go in… They even ask me, they ask me for my license plate, for identify… I said, \"I don't know if I have it.\" They said, \"Sir, you have to have it.\" I was very impressed, actually. But it's very hard to cheat with mail-in voting. As you know what happens in California, it's so corrupt, where some people get 5, 6, 7 ballots delivered to them, that we got to stop mail-in voting, and the Republicans have to lead the charge.\n\n(25:45)The Democrats want it because they have horrible policy. If you have mail-in voting, you're not going to have many Democrats get elected. That's bigger than anything having to do with redistricting, believe me. And the Republicans have to get smart. We're not going to have a country. I said for a long time at rallies, you need borders, and you need free and fair elections. Those two things, otherwise you don't have… We have strong borders now. In 90 days, Mr. President, we didn't have one, zero, zero, in three months. Not one person came in illegally into our country. In fact, even I find that hard to believe, but it's run by a little bit of a liberal group that put out the numbers, so I guess it's… But zero, zero, and zero. You go back a year ago, two years ago, three, millions of people poured into our country. It was terrible. Thank you very much.\n\nReporters (26:36):\n\n[inaudible 00:26:36].\n\n(26:36)President Zelenskyy, what security guarantees do you need for President Trump to be able to make a deal? Is it American troops? Intelligence? Equipment? What is it?\n\nVolodymyr Zelenskyy (26:52):\n\nEverything. Really, it includes two parts. First, strong Ukrainian army. That what I began to discuss with your colleagues. And it's a lot about weapon, and then people and training missions and intelligence. And second, we will discuss with our partners. It depends on the big countries, on the United States, on a lot of our friends.\n\nReporters (27:14):\n\nMr. President-\n\n(27:15)[inaudible 00:27:16].\n\n(27:15)… are you willing to commit American troops to that NATO-like protection in order to give President Zelenskyy to a deal today?\n\nDonald Trump (27:22):\n\nWell, I don't know if you define it that way, but NATO-like? We have people waiting in another room right now, they're all here from Europe, biggest people in Europe, and they want to give protection. They feel very strongly about it, and we'll help them out with that. I think it's very important.\n\nReporters (27:39):\n\nMr. President, [inaudible 00:27:40].\n\nDonald Trump (27:39):\n\nI think it's very important to get the deal.\n\nReporters (27:40):\n\n[inaudible 00:27:40].\n\nDonald Trump (27:40):\n\nYes, go ahead.\n\nReporters (27:43):\n\nYou've been involved with the peacekeeping in Ukraine since your first day in the administration. What would you say to the Ukrainian people right now who are suffering under the Russian attacks and hoping that the American people will stand with them?\n\nDonald Trump (27:59):\n\nWell, I know Ukrainian people. I've known many over the years, they're great people. They're smart, they're energetic. They love their country. They love their country, and we want to get this war ended. That's all I can do. I love the Ukrainian people, but I love all people. I love the Russian people. I love them all. I want to get the war stopped. Very important.\n\nReporters (28:20):\n\n[inaudible 00:28:21].\n\n(28:20)Mr. President, was there any aspect of your discussion with Vladimir Putin that left you disappointed?\n\nDonald Trump (28:30):\n\nLook, we just spoke to, I was just telling the president, I just spoke to President Putin indirectly, and we're going to have a phone call right after these meetings today. And we may or may not have a trilat. If we don't have a trilat, then the fighting continues, and if we do, we have a good chance. I think if we have a trilat, there's a good chance of maybe ending it. But he's expecting my call when we're finished with this meeting. Thank you very much, everybody.\n\nReporters (28:57):\n\n[inaudible 00:28:58].\n\nSpeaker 4 (29:02):\n\nThank you, press! Thank you, press! Let's go, let's go, everybody out!\n\nDonald Trump (29:02):\n\nThank you, thank you.\n\nSpeaker 4 (29:02):\n\nThanks, guys! Thank you!",

    "date": "",
    "transcript": "President Donald Trump (00:00):\n\nIt's a great honor. Thank you.\n\n(00:11)It's a long time, 35 years, they fought, and now they're friends. And they're going to be friends for a long time. But it's a big, beautiful honor to welcome everyone to the White House for this very historic peace summit between Armenia and Azerbaijan. It's really a great thrill for me. I love seeing good people get together, and that's what you have here, two great leaders.\n\n(00:41)I want to congratulate these two visionary people, Prime Minister Pashinyan and President Aliyev, for coming to Washington to sign this momentous joint declaration. It's a tremendously important document, and it's been a long time in coming. They were explaining before that so many times they thought they could get there. It never happened. It just never happened.\n\n(01:09)I also want to thank Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Special Envoy Steve Witkoff, and their teams at the State Department. And I see that we have Chris Wright outside and Senator Steve Daines sitting right here.\n\n(01:24)Thank you, Chris. Thank you very much. And, Steve, thank you very much. And we have some other wonderful dignitaries, including the dignitaries from your country, but they provided a tremendous diplomatic assistance. And, Marco, congratulations. It's a big thing. Keep going. He got many jobs. And then, of course, you would say Steve was quite influential. I call him Henry Kissinger who doesn't leak.\n\n(01:54)For more than 35 years, Armenia and Azerbaijan have fought a bitter conflict that resulted in tremendous suffering for both nations. They suffered gravely for so many years. Many tried to find a resolution, including the European Union. The Russians worked very hard on it. It never happened. Sleepy Joe Biden tried, but you know what happened there. He tried for probably 12 minutes, and it didn't work out. And many other countries tried, and they were unsuccessful. But, with this accord, we've finally succeeded in making peace. And we just left the Oval Office where we signed voluminous documents and very important elements to the agreement.\n\n(02:39)The country of Armenia and Azerbaijan are committing to stop all fighting forever, open up commerce, travel and diplomatic relations, and respect each other's sovereignty and territorial integrity so importantly. And I just spent a lot of time with these two men. I think they're going to have a great relationship. You want to know the truth? They didn't see each other that much, but they'll probably will.\n\n(03:06)I think you two are going to have a great relationship. I have no doubt. And if you don't, call me and I'll straighten it out. Okay?\n\n(03:15)Very importantly, we have also resolved the key issue that foiled previous negotiations. This declaration establishes what they're calling, a great honor for me, I didn't ask for this, the Trump Route for International Peace and Prosperity, which is a special transit area that will allow Azerbaijan to get full access to its territory of Nakhchivan while fully respecting Armenia's sovereignty so they're going to be able to really live and work together. And it's amazing. So that's a very important territory, I guess, a very special territory to you and to you. And, now, they work together.\n\n(03:58)Armenia is also creating an exclusive partnership with the United States to develop this corridor which could extend for up to 99 years. And then they promise, in 99 years, they'll extend it, right? You promise. But we anticipate significant infrastructure development by American companies. They're very anxious to go in to these two countries, and they're going to spend a lot of money, a lot of money, which will economically benefit all three of our nations. This is incredibly positive news for the future of the entire region. And it's a very important region as you know.\n\n(04:32)Additionally, the US is signing a bilateral agreement with both countries to expand cooperation in energy, trade, and technology, including AI. And, in terms of energy, Chris is here representing our country. And there's nobody better than Chris Wright.\n\n(04:49)And, Chris, I understand it's very fertile. It's a very fertile area, so I appreciate everything you've done. You've done amazingly well. We've got the gasoline prices coming way down from where they were, and it's really been something to watch. We are drilling like we haven't drilled in many years, I guess, I could say ever before, and we just started.\n\n(05:14)We're also lifting restrictions on defense cooperation between Azerbaijan and the United States of America. That's a big deal unless… Is that important to you? I think so. It was pretty good. They're very happy about that. So am I. As president, my highest aspiration is to bring peace and stability to the world.\n\n(05:36)Today's signing follows our success with India and Pakistan. They were going at it. They were going at it big, and they were great, two great leaders that came together just prior to what would have been a tremendous conflict as you know, a nuclear conflict probably.\n\n(05:54)Also, the Congo and Rwanda, now that was one which was going on for 31 years. You have them beat 35 years. You had them beat. But that was going on for 31 years. And we have it all done, and people are very happy. That was a rough one. That was nasty. 7 million people that they know of died.\n\n(06:15)Also, just recently, Thailand and Cambodia, that was one that was just starting. 2,000 people were dead on the border, but it was just starting. And I was talking to one of the two nations on trade, and I said, \"I'm not going to sign a trade deal if you guys are going to fight.\" And I got the other one, and, again, great leadership, Thailand and Cambodia, and, before it got started, beyond that first couple of days, we stopped the war.\n\n(06:42)And they've had wars periodically very much as you two have had long-term wars. And we got it stopped. And the two, again, I find, in all cases, they're great leaders. If they didn't agree, I would say they're lousy leaders, to be honest with you. But they did agree, and so Thailand and Cambodia, Serbia and Kosovo, we got something stopped that was ready to start. We didn't like that one. We didn't like it at all. And we saved a lot of lives and numerous others.\n\n(07:13)In addition, as you know, we took out the nuclear capability of Iran and, to use a term that people tried to dispute without any knowledge, it was obliterated. That's been confirmed by the Atomic Energy Commission. Everybody that saw it, it's totally obliterated. They might try again, but they're going to have to try a new site because they are… And I want to just say, our military, we have the greatest military in the world. We have the greatest equipment and military manufacturing anywhere in the world, nobody even close, and that sort of proved it.\n\n(07:45)So getting rid of that threat from the Middle East was very big. And I think a lot of people are going to be joining right now the Abraham Accords. It's going to be very important. So, hopefully, we're going to have many more successes. I hope we're not going to have too many more in this field because hopefully we're not going to be seeing too many more wars. I came in, and this whole world was on fire. All these things were sort of happening. We've only been here for six months. The world was on fire. We took care of just about every fire. And we're working on another one that you're reporting on very strongly with Russia, Ukraine. And we'll have some more information for you a little bit later.\n\n(08:26)But I want to ask these two very special people. Again, I've gotten to know them. They're very special people. And I think they have the potential to have a great personal relationship, which is always good, but also a great, just relationship. And, if I might, may I ask you to say a few words, sir?\n\nPresident Aliyev (08:46):\n\nThank you very much, Mr. President. First of all, thank you for the invitation. It's a big honor to be invited by the President of the United States for this historic event. Actually, we are writing a new history in bilateral interstate relationship between the United States and Azerbaijan. We are starting the path towards strategic partnership. The Charter on Strategic Partnership will be elaborated within several months, and that is a historic achievement for Azerbaijan, because to be in the format of strategic partnership with the greatest country of the world is a great opportunity and also a very big responsibility.\n\n(09:32)And this strategic partnership format embraces so many important areas, mutual investments, trade, energy, connectivity, transit, AI, defense sales, counterterrorism, so all these areas where we had, and hopefully will have, a very active cooperation in the future. It opens a lot of opportunities for Azerbaijan to continue its path of development, to diversify its economy, to keep unemployment low as it is today, and to look to the future with a great optimism.\n\n(10:13)Also, I'm very grateful to Mr. President that he, today, lifted the restrictions which has been imposed on Azerbaijan back in 1992. Just only one year after Azerbaijan restored its independence, these restrictions have been imposed on us. So, after 33 years, these restrictions have been lifted just today. So, really, it's a day which will be remembered by the people of Azerbaijan with a feeling of pride and gratitude to President Trump for his attitude towards Azerbaijan, for his vision not only for our region.\n\n(10:56)We were exchanging views today. And I said that, within several months,\n\nPresident Aliyev (11:00):\n\nOnce he managed to put an end to conflicts in Asia, in Africa, and now in Southern Caucasus, what we could not achieve for more than 30 years. We had to sacrifice lives. We had to fight two very bad wars with a lot of casualties. And if not for President Trump and his team and our great friend, Mr. Ratcliffe, and his team, probably today Armenia and Azerbaijan would've been again in this endless process of negotiations.\n\n(11:33)So really it's a historic day. We are today establishing peace in the Caucasus, which will open great opportunities not only for our region. And as President Trump correctly mentioned, the Trump Route for International Peace and Prosperity, which will create new connectivity lines, which will lift the walls and which will create connectivity opportunities for so many countries with investments, with prosperity, with stability.\n\n(12:06)Azerbaijan and Armenia, we became independent at the same time as a result of the collapse of the Soviet Union. But at that time already, we were at war. So we lost a lot of years just being preoccupied with wars and occupation and bloodshed. So today, historic day also because we bring peace. President Trump brings peace to Caucasus and we're grateful for that.\n\n(12:35)And I'm sure that Armenia and Azerbaijan will find courage and responsibility to reconcile and also the people will reconcile. We will turn the page of standoff, confrontation and bloodshed and provide bright and safe future for our children. So I'm very happy because today we're writing the great new history. And once again, Mr. President, thank you for all what we are doing for us, for our region, and for the whole world.\n\nPresident Donald Trump (13:08):\n\nThank you very much.\n\nPresident Aliyev (13:08):\n\nThank you.\n\nPresident Donald Trump (13:18):\n\nGreat leaders, how long have you been in the leadership position?\n\nPresident Aliyev (13:22):\n\n22 years.\n\nPresident Donald Trump (13:24):\n\n22 years?\n\nPresident Aliyev (13:25):\n\nYeah.\n\nPresident Donald Trump (13:26):\n\nThat's pretty good. That means he's tough and smart and it's an amazing part of the world. Congratulations.\n\nPresident Aliyev (13:33):\n\nThank you.\n\nPresident Donald Trump (13:33):\n\nWhat a great honor to be involved. Thank you.\n\nPresident Aliyev (13:35):\n\nThank you very much.\n\nPresident Donald Trump (13:37):\n\nPlease.\n\nNikol Pashinyan (13:39):\n\nThank you, Mr. President. Ladies and gentlemen, today we have reached a significant milestone in Armenia-Azerbaijani relations. We're laying a foundation to write a better story than the one we had in the past. This breakthrough would simply not have been possible without President Trump's personal engagement and his resolute commitment to peace in our region. The initialing of peace agreement will pave the way to end the decades of conflict between our countries and open a new era based on the full respect for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of each other. Today's declarations, which President Trump personally will sign as well as witness, gives confidence and assurance that we're opening a chapter of peace, prosperity, security, and economic cooperation in the South Caucasus. In this context, allow me to highlight the agreement on opening transport communications in the region based on the principles of sovereignty, total integrity and jurisdiction.\n\n(15:07)I'm particularly thrilled that together with the US, Armenia will work to bring to life the trip Trump wrote for peace and prosperity, a connectivity project that will unlock the entire region. Trip will unlock strategic economic opportunities that will create long-term benefits. It will promote infrastructure investment, enhanced regional connectivity, and strengthen US leadership as a champion of conflict resolution.\n\n(15:44)I want to thank President Trump and his team for brokering this game-changing outcome between Armenia and Azerbaijan. This is a great deal we've achieved today. This is a success for our countries and for our region, and the success for the world because a more peaceful region means a safer world. This is peace through strength in a nutshell.\n\n(16:12)Mr. President, today's great achievement is yet another testimony to your global leadership and your legacy as a statesman and a peacemaker on the world stage. Bringing peace required vision, political courage and determination. But what is most important is that it requires faith in the cause. As it is said in the Holy Bible, \"Blessed are the peacemakers for they will called children of God.\" May God enlighten this way.\n\n(16:54)Thank you and my congratulations to all of us, President Aliyev, to you, to all of us colleagues from Azerbaijan, Armenia, United States, and all the people of our region, all the people of our countries. And my congratulations to the world because as I said, it will definitely make world a better place. Thank you.\n\nPresident Donald Trump (17:25):\n\nThat's great. Thank you very much.\n\nSpeaker 1 (17:35):\n\nMr. President of the United States, the President of the Republic of Azerbaijan and the Prime Minister of the Republic of Armenia will now sign the joint declaration on the outcomes of the Trump Route for International Peace and Prosperity Summit.\n\nPresident Donald Trump (17:45):\n\nThat's really good.\n\nSpeaker 1 (17:45):\n\nThey will sign three copies in English. The President of the United States signs as a witness to the President of the Republic of Azerbaijan and the Prime Minister of the Republic of Armenia, affirming their path to peace, stability, and prosperity. We kindly ask that all guests remain seated for the signing of the documents.\n\nPresident Donald Trump (18:50):\n\n[inaudible 00:18:19] That is so great, and we'll hold up. How about holding up that document? All right.\n\n(18:56)Well, thank you. This is really a big day. And we have some other big announcements, but I didn't want to make them because I don't want to do anything that could even in a little way overshadow what's taken place today. 35 years of death and hatred, and now it's going to be love and respect and success together. And I didn't really want to do anything that would in any way overshadow. I don't think it can be overshadowed when you're at war and so many people have suffered and so many people have been killed, and now you're going to have great peace.\n\n(19:44)And I look forward to that corridor because that corridor says, \"I'm going to have to get over there.\" I'll bring Senator Daines with me, and we're going to have to get over this, Steve. But this is a really great achievement, and I congratulate you. You're two incredible leaders. You're going to go down in history. And I've read the whole thing about how long it took. And you thought you were there and people let you down, and sometimes you probably let people down. Maybe, I don't know how it works, but that's the way it usually does. But this is something that is very, very special.\n\n(20:18)So I don't want to get in the way of it at all, but we'll take a few questions, maybe at least slightly related. But we have some other things to announce later on in the day. Peter, please.\n\nPeter (20:29):\n\nRelated, just because you mentioned the elusive piece in Ukraine. Who is holding up this Ukraine ceasefire summit? Is it Putin or is it Zelenskyy?\n\nPresident Donald Trump (20:40):\n\nWell, I think it's that one is, as you know, we've been working on a lot of these deals. We've closed every single one of them all throughout the world, and that's the last of them. And they're losing, Peter, about six, maybe even 7,000 soldiers every single week. Russia, as you know, lost almost 25,000 over the last month and a half, and Ukraine lost just a small number, fewer. It's a lot of lot people are dying. And I think we're getting very close and we're going to be announcing later on, we're going to have a meeting with Russia, start off with Russia, and we'll announce a location. I think the location will be a very popular one for a lot of reasons, but we'll be announcing that a little bit later. I just don't want to do it now because of the importance of what we just did.\n\nPeter (21:32):\n\nI completely understand that.\n\nPresident Donald Trump (21:33):\n\nYeah. Please. Go ahead.\n\nPeter (21:33):\n\nJust a follow-up. Are you surprised that Zelenskyy hasn't figured out by now in years of war, how to deal with you and to deal with Putin without needing permission to make concessions from his parliament or from a national referendum?\n\nPresident Donald Trump (21:48):\n\nWell, he's going out and getting what he needs. He's not authorized to do certain things. I said, \"Well, you're going to have to get it fast, because we're getting very close to a deal.\"\n\nPresident Donald Trump (22:00):\n\nAnd he's doing that and he's working with the European nations and they're terrific people, terrific leaders, NATO. And as you know, I became very friendly with him. They agreed to go from 2% to 5%. 2% that they didn't pay to 5% that they've already paid. It's trillions of dollars. So we're working together very closely. But no, in all fairness to President Zelensky, he's getting everything he needs to, assuming we get something done. But I'll be meeting very shortly with President Putin. It would've been sooner, but I guess there's security arrangements that unfortunately people have to make. Otherwise, I'd do it much quicker. He would too. He'd like to meet as soon as possible. I agree with it. But we'll be announcing that very shortly, okay? And location.\n\nSpeaker 2 (22:47):\n\nCan I ask a question?\n\nPresident Donald Trump (22:49):\n\nYeah, please, please.\n\nSpeaker 2 (22:51):\n\nMr. President, with this meeting with Putin, is this Russia's last chance to achieve peace? And do you expect Ukraine to make any type of territorial concessions?\n\nPresident Donald Trump (23:01):\n\nI don't like using the term last chance. Look, this is two very, very smart people they've been going at it for… And their predecessors also very smart. They've been going at it for 35 years. It's tough. When those guns start going off, it's awfully tough to get them to stop. It really does. It's a war that should have never happened. It would've never happened if our president. There was no reason for it. And so many people are killed. So much cultural destruction.\n\n(23:29)You look at those magnificent towers, the most beautiful in the world. The spires were considered the most beautiful in the world. They're all in a million pieces laying on the ground, all obliterated, knocked into a million pieces. So sad. But millions of people have died and very much set in their ways. A lot of people were set in their ways.\n\n(23:55)But I think we're getting close. I mean, this was not my war. This was Biden's war. But the European Union has been great. As you know, they're purchasing equipment from us. They have a lot of money and they're spending a lot of money on buying equipment. We're not spending money, but we are supplying them equipment. They're paying for it. And I think that a lot of things happened recently that would make this go forward. I'm not going to mention anything having to do with India, but maybe that had an impact. But what really had an impact was NATO has stepped up in terms of their spending on buying military equipment.\n\n(24:34)We're in for probably through Biden and his people, $350 billion. $350 billion, when they hear these numbers, you're saying that's a lot of money. 350 billion the United States has spent on that. They should have spent nothing because it should have never happened. It would've never happened. Europe is in for over a hundred billion dollars, which it should be the opposite if we were in for anything. But it should be the opposite. And I will say that Europe wants to see peace.\n\n(25:07)The European leaders want to see peace. President Putin, I believe, wants to see peace, and Zelensky wants to see peace. Now, President Zelensky has to get all of his… Everything he needs because he's going to have to get ready to sign something. And I think he is working hard to get that done.\n\nSpeaker 2 (25:27):\n\n[inaudible 00:25:28]\n\nPresident Donald Trump (25:30):\n\nWell, you're looking at territory that's been fought over for three and a half years with a lot of Russians have died, a lot of Ukrainians have died. So we're looking at that, but we're actually looking to get some back and some swapping. It's complicated. It's actually nothing easy. It's very complicated. But we're going to get some back. We're going to get some switched. There'll be some swapping of territories to the betterment of both, but we'll be talking about that either later or tomorrow or whatever. Yeah, please?\n\nSpeaker 3 (26:05):\n\n[inaudible 00:26:06]\n\nPresident Donald Trump (26:07):\n\nSay it?\n\nSpeaker 3 (26:08):\n\nIf I could ask a question of your guests, and also if you… Of the guest, will the Armenians from Nagorno-Karabakh be allowed to return? And also, do you have any thoughts on the talk about, President Trump, winning the Nobel Peace Prize? And for, President Trump, you're working on resolving two other major conflicts. In Gaza, you've spoke of resettling the Gazans. The country of Somaliland has expressed potential interest if you were to diplomatically recognize their independence. Are you inclined to do so? And also, did President Putin present an award to Mr. Witkoff during their recent visit?\n\nPresident Donald Trump (26:42):\n\nHe likes Mr. Witkoff, I can tell you that. That's true. Please go ahead.\n\nNikol Pashinyan (26:50):\n\nI think President Trump deserved to have a Nobel Peace Prize. And we will defend that and we will promote for that. And that's obvious. And today's event, I think is a very bright expression of that. And hopefully you will invite us.\n\nPresident Donald Trump (27:22):\n\nFront row. You'll be front row.\n\nNikol Pashinyan (27:24):\n\nYeah? Yeah.\n\nPresident Donald Trump (27:25):\n\nThank you very much.\n\nNikol Pashinyan (27:26):\n\nWe are in favor.\n\nPresident Donald Trump (27:27):\n\nThank you. Thank you.\n\nPresident Aliyev (27:30):\n\nCan I have a suggestion?\n\nPresident Donald Trump (27:32):\n\nYes.\n\nPresident Aliyev (27:32):\n\nSo maybe we agree with Prime Minister Pashinyan to send a joint appeal to Nobel Committee to award President Trump with the Nobel Peace Prize because from the leaders of the countries which were at war for more than three decades, having this historic signature here, it really means a lot. This is tangible result of President Trump's leadership. And no one could have achieved that. There have been many presidents here since beginning of '90s, and the so-called Minsk process, which by the way today we put an end to with my Armenian colleague, started in 1992.\n\n(28:25)So negotiation under the auspices of OSCE continued for more than three decades without any result. So who, if not President Trump deserves the Nobel Peace Prize? I don't want to go into the history of some very strange decisions of a Nobel Peace Committee to award the prize for someone who didn't do anything at all. But President Trump in six months did miracle. So I think that my Armenian colleague will support it and judging by the reaction of the audience, I think as soon as we come back, we will agree to issue a joint letter and hopefully… And I also joined when president is awarded. We hope that he will-\n\nPresident Donald Trump (29:12):\n\nThank you.\n\nPresident Aliyev (29:12):\n\n… invite us to the ceremony.\n\nPresident Donald Trump (29:14):\n\nYou certainly will be. Thank you very much.\n\nNikol Pashinyan (29:17):\n\nDo we have draft to sign now?\n\nPresident Donald Trump (29:21):\n\nWell, we'll see what happens. It's really-\n\nPresident Aliyev (29:22):\n\nWe already like to sign.\n\nPresident Donald Trump (29:25):\n\nThank you very much. It's very nice.\n\nSpeaker 3 (29:27):\n\nAnything from Somaliland?\n\nPresident Donald Trump (29:28):\n\nWe're looking into that right now. Good question actually. And another complex one, as you know. But we're working on that right now, Somaliland.\n\nSpeaker 4 (29:36):\n\nMr. President, thank you so much. I wanted to ask you, have you spoken to Russian president, Putin yet? And would you go to Russia or Ukraine, and what exactly would you say?\n\nPresident Donald Trump (29:45):\n\nWe'll be announcing a location and maybe a little while, and I think you'll be a very happy. We'll see what happens, right? All we can do is do our best. We've been working on this one for a long time. This is a very complicated one also. This was extremely complicated, but we made it less complicated and we had two very brilliant people on my right and my left. They understood what was at stake. I think if it didn't get done now, it might've never gotten done.\n\n(30:15)So this is the very similar with Ukraine. It became more and more complicated as time went on. It was simple at the beginning. Wasn't going to happen, but it became more and more complicated. But I think we're getting close. Yes, ma'am.\n\nSpeaker 5 (30:27):\n\n[inaudible 00:30:29]\n\nPresident Donald Trump (30:29):\n\nYes. Go ahead, please.\n\nSpeaker 5 (30:31):\n\nCould the location for the summit be Italy?\n\nPresident Donald Trump (30:33):\n\nWhat?\n\nSpeaker 7 (30:33):\n\n[inaudible 00:30:34]\n\nPresident Aliyev (30:33):\n\nThe location, Italy.\n\nPresident Donald Trump (30:39):\n\nI will give it to you very soon. Honestly, I don't want to do anything. These guys, I don't want to do anything where that's like… Because this is a bigger story than a location. A location is good. I'm a real estate person. I know about a location, but there's nothing to compete with this in terms of what we're doing today. It is just such a great achievement for these two. Really, they'll go down as great leaders for what they did. I put them together, but what they have been able… And I don't want to do anything, so we'll talk about it later today. We'll give you a location today. What about\n\nSpeaker 4 (31:16):\n\n[inaudible 00:31:16] cartels too. You were talking about sending military forces to fight against the drug cartels in Latin America. Do you think it's worth sending our forces, our US forces there to take this on?\n\nPresident Donald Trump (31:26):\n\nCartels, where?\n\nSpeaker 4 (31:29):\n\nCentral Latin America.\n\nPresident Donald Trump (31:30):\n\nWell, Latin America has got lot of cartels. They've got a lot of drugs flowing. So we want to protect our country. We have to protect our country. We haven't been doing it for four years, and we love this country like they love their countries. We have to protect our country. So we're playing a tough game, but we'll have more to say about that soon. Yes, ma'am.\n\nSpeaker 8 (31:52):\n\nMr. President, I'm Sola from Azerbaijan News Agency Report. So we are grateful to be here. Today, you host a truly historic meeting. As a person who values diplomacy and global interaction, do you consider the possibility to visiting Azerbaijan? Actually, you mentioned Azerbaijan and Armenia after this meeting.\n\nPresident Donald Trump (32:10):\n\n[inaudible 00:32:11]\n\nPresident Aliyev (32:11):\n\nTo visit our countries, do you consider to visit?\n\nPresident Donald Trump (32:17):\n\nWhich one do I consider better?\n\nSpeaker 8 (32:19):\n\nBoth, yeah.\n\nPresident Aliyev (32:19):\n\nBoth.\n\nNikol Pashinyan (32:19):\n\nBoth.\n\nPresident Donald Trump (32:22):\n\nI think if I ever said that, that you would say, \"This guy couldn't have solved the problem.\" You know what? I consider them both great, okay? And you know what? They're going to be even greater. And they're very different in many ways, but they have a lot in common. But they're both great as far as I'm concerned. Yeah, please. It's an interesting question, right? That would've been a hell of an answer if I said, \"Well, I think I like this one or that one.\" No, we don't do that. Go ahead, please.\n\nSpeaker 6 (32:49):\n\nMr. President, first of all, thank you for bringing peace to South Caucus is something that no one has been able to achieve in 35 years.\n\nPresident Donald Trump (32:58):\n\nThank you.\n\nSpeaker 6 (32:58):\n\nThat's number one.\n\nSpeaker 6 (33:00):\n\nWe also notice that you think highly of the commitments that the sides have taken on and assumed. However, considering the long history of conflict and the fact that this is not a legally binding document, will there be consequences if at some point of the sides takes a step back?\n\nPresident Donald Trump (33:19):\n\nI don't think it's going to happen. I think it's going to be very good, and I told them, I gave them a personal commitment, if there's… There's always little problems here and there, right? The big ones have been solved. The giant ones have been solved. But if there's conflict, they both know they're going to call me and we're going to get it straightened out. They're not going to have a problem. Where are you from?\n\nSpeaker 6 (33:39):\n\nArmenia.\n\nPresident Donald Trump (33:40):\n\nOkay, good. Very good. I was wondering. It was a very unusual question, but it's not unusual considering you're from Armenia. If there's a problem, we will get it worked out. I told them both, don't let the problem last. We get it early and we'll get it solved. Good reporter you have over there. Okay.\n\nPresident Aliyev (34:00):\n\nCan I add?\n\nPresident Donald Trump (34:00):\n\nYes, please. Please.\n\nPresident Aliyev (34:04):\n\nFirst of all, I'd like to say that today we initialed the peace deal, which was in the process of negotiations for quite a while. The fact that it is initialed here in the capital number one of the world, in the office number one of the world, and in front of the great president of United States, means that there should be no doubts and no suspicious that any of the sides would step back. If any of us, Prime Minister Pashinyan or myself, had in mind to step back, we wouldn't have come here. So you can be absolutely sure as well as Azerbaijani community that what has happened today will result in peace. Long-lasting peace. Eternal peace in the caucuses.\n\nPresident Donald Trump (34:57):\n\nThat's a very nice statement.\n\nSpeaker 10 (34:57):\n\nI'm sorry. I'm sorry. Fully agree and nothing to add.\n\nPresident Donald Trump (35:05):\n\nThat's a very nice two statements, but that's a beautifully stated statement. Let's go a couple of more. Yeah, please.\n\nSpeaker 9 (35:13):\n\nMr. President. Many in the south caucuses have pinned the blame on your predecessor, Joe Biden and his Secretary of State, Antony Blinken for obstacles in America's bilateral relations with Azerbaijan and peace in that part of the world. How important is it to you to elevate your country's partnership and your administration's partnership with Azerbaijan, with Armenia, and how important is this for your legacy?\n\nPresident Donald Trump (35:39):\n\nWell, to me it's very important, but I know the history of what was going on because I do a lot of reading and they've had a very Contentious relationship for a long time. I mean, it's war. Most of the time was war. And so to get it done, they're great people, I know a lot of people from Armenia, I know a lot of people from both countries, and they're incredible people, and it shouldn't happen what has happened, I wish we could have been here sooner. If the election were different, I'm going to be nice to them, I'm not going to be controversial and say the election was rigged, I would've had this thing solved four years sooner. But the truth is, it's right. If the election weren't rigged, I would've been here four years sooner. We would've signed the same agreement four years sooner, but it didn't happen, and the Biden administration did really very little, actually nothing to get it done, but they did nothing to get really anything done.\n\n(36:37)This country was in very serious shape, and I say it over and over again. I met all the leaders of NATO, I went, as you know, to the Middle East. I was with the king of Saudi Arabia, the leaders of great countries, Qatar and UAE and others in the Middle East, and everyone essentially said the same thing. We had a dead country. One year ago we had a dead country. Our country was dying, and now we have the hottest country anywhere in the world. It's not even close. We have the hottest country in the world, and it's an honor to use that, if you call it power or respect or whatever it is, to settle wars like we have right here to my left and my right, and these two guys are very smart. I got to know them, and they're very smart. I don't think they're going to ever have to bother with me, and they may call me just to bug me a little bit. Let me put them to a test and they'll call because they like to call me, but they're not going to have any problem.\n\n(37:34)We have a very comprehensive agreement. It's a peace agreement, and this isn't ceasefire, this isn't, we'll, hold off. This is a peace agreement, and they're going to end up doing a lot of business with each other. They're going to do a lot of business with the United States, and I'm going to always remember, at least during the time that I'm here, I'm going to remember how smart they were, how good they were, and when it comes to trade and other things, we're going to always go 100% out. We'll go out of our way to make sure it comes out good for them. They did an amazingly good thing and a very brave thing. It's a very complicated part of the world they come from, very tough part of the world. It's a tough, tough but smart part of the world. Smart, tough people and great wealth. Great energy wealth.\n\n(38:21)I was talking to Chris and you were saying in terms of wealth, it's enormous wealth, but wealth doesn't often solve problems, takes other things, but they're amazing, two amazing leaders, and it's an honor to be associated with them. How about, we'll do one more please.\n\nSpeaker 1 (38:41):\n\nThank you, Mr. President. Your gut instincts have always done well in terms of business and in terms of politics. What does your gut tell you as it relates to the possibility of an event like this in the next few weeks, the next few months, in which you have President Putin on one side and President Zelenskyy on your other side?\n\nPresident Donald Trump (39:00):\n\nI think my instinct really tells me that we have a shot at it, okay? And you'll find that out later on and maybe even today, but we have a shot at it. Look, it's got to be solved. We're not losing people. A lot of people say, \"Why are you bothering?\" We're not losing people. We were spending hundreds of billions of dollars, now we're spending nothing. We're spending no money. I guess we're making money because we have the best military equipment in the world. We're selling it to NATO. But you're losing thousands of people a week. Russians and Ukrainians mostly, mostly soldiers, but missiles are lobbed into cities and towns, Kiev, lots of places. You've been reading the same stories that I've been reading, and we got to get it solved.\n\nSpeaker 1 (39:52):\n\nThe Norwegian Nobel Committee will make their announcement as it relates to this year's Nobel Peace Prize on October the 10th, Friday, October the 10th. Is that date circled on your calendar, Mr. President?\n\nPresident Donald Trump (40:04):\n\nI can't say. I mean, a lot of people say, though, no matter what I did, because of a certain persuasion, no matter what I do, they won't give it, and I'm not politicking for it. I have a lot of people that are. I know, I read the same things as you do, but it would be a great honor, certainly, but I would never politic. I'm not doing it for that. I'm doing it because of number one, I want to save lives. That's why I'm involved so much with Ukraine and Russia, saving lives of Russians and Ukrainians. It's not American lives.\n\n(40:39)Now, I would say this, that war could have escalated in something much… That could have been a world war. I think if we didn't come, Ukraine, Russia would've ended up being a world war, and I stopped that. That stopped. Now, the only question is when is it going to be settled? And it could be very soon, but when is it going to be? But that would've been a world war. If I didn't come along with a very talented group of people sitting largely right here, but there are others not in the room that are very talented, I think Russia, Ukraine would've had a very, very high degree, I think even probably would've ended up being in a world war.\n\nSpeaker 1 (41:18):\n\nYour predecessor-\n\nPresident Donald Trump (41:19):\n\nI don't think people talk about that now because they don't see it anymore, but we brought it down a long way. But that was getting to a point. When I first came in, I said, \"Wow, this thing is really bad.\" And it could have escalated to a level that you people would've been very unhappy with. Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1 (41:41):\n\nYour predecessor, Mr. President, President Ronald Reagan had a phrase as it relates to dealing with the then Soviet Union and also Mikhail Gorbachev. The phrase was, \"Trust but verify.: Do you subscribe to that same view as it relates to Mr. Putin and Russia?\n\nPresident Donald Trump (41:55):\n\nWell, I do relating to everybody, not just President Putin, but also people and leaders that I deal with. Look, I'm dealing with trade and some of the worst deals we made, some of the worst trade deals we have. I talk about friend and foe, right? Friend and foe. Two interesting words. Some of our worst trade deals were not with the foe, they were with the friends. Our friends were just killing us on trade. Not anymore. Not anymore. We're taking in trillions of dollars and we're respected and we're settling through trade, even a little bit here, less here than on some, but through trade. I got things settled with India, Pakistan, I think it was trade more than any other reason. That's how I got involved. I said, \"I don't want to be dealing with countries that are trying to blow up themselves and maybe the world.\"\n\n(42:50)They're nuclear nations. That was a big one, getting that one settled. I think you'd agree, that was a big one. And they were going at it. They were shooting airplanes out of the sky. Five or six planes got shot down in their last little skirmish, and then it was going to escalate from there, and they could have gotten to be very, very bad. Now, I want to save a lot of lives. I love saving lives. That's what it's about. And when you save lives, you really end up having a peaceful world. Usually that ends up pretty well. I want to thank everybody, but in particular these two great leaders for having the courage to do what they did today, and they're going to go down in the history books, and it's a great honor to be involved. Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you.",

    "transcript": "Prime Minister Keir Starmer (00:00):\n\nWell, let me welcome you, Mr. President, to Scotland and fantastic to be here at Turnberry with you. Thank you so much for showing us around and having this opportunity to sit in this fantastic ballroom, which is absolutely incredible.\n\n(00:17)And to start talking about some of the issues that are most pressing in your country and in my country. And in particular, we've had the opportunity to talk about the situation in Gaza, the intolerable situation, including images of starvation.\n\n(00:34)And I think both of us know that we have to get to that ceasefire and we have to increase humanitarian aid in. And thank you for what you've already been doing, are doing and are committed to because without you, this would not be capable of resolution.\n\n(00:52)And I think that if we can work not just on the pressing issues of the ceasefire, but also on this issue of getting humanitarian aid in at volume, at speed.\n\n(01:05)And then we've discussed a plan for what then happens afterwards. I think we can do our very best to alleviate what is an awful situation at the moment.\n\n(01:18)So thank you very much for the discussion we've had so far and the discussion we're about to continue on that really important issue.\n\n(01:26)But it's fantastic to be here.\n\nPresident Donald Trump (01:28):\n\nThank you very much.\n\nPrime Minister Keir Starmer (01:28):\n\nThank you for your hospitality and to see this amazing golf course. I'll invite you to a football ground at some stage and we can exchange sports.\n\nPresident Donald Trump (01:40):\n\nIt's been great being with you and thank you very much Mr. Prime Minister. And you've done a fantastic job with regard to the trade deal.\n\n(01:46)You know they've wanted a trade deal here for years, many years, through many different terms of different people, and you got it done. So I want to congratulate you on that and it's a great deal for both.\n\n(02:00)It brings unity. We didn't need unity, but it brings us even closer together, I think. It's good for both parties.\n\n(02:08)We also discussed obviously Gaza and I think before we get to phase two, which is what's going to happen afterwards, we want to get the children fed.\n\n(02:16)We made a contribution a week ago of $60 million all going into food. We only hope the food goes to the people that need it. So much as you know, when you do something there, it gets taken by Hamas or somebody, but it gets taken.\n\n(02:36)And we're prepared to help. We want to help. It's a terrible situation. The whole thing is terrible. It's been bad for many years, but it's great to hear you feel the same way that I do.\n\nPrime Minister Keir Starmer (02:48):\n\nYeah.\n\nPresident Donald Trump (02:49):\n\nWe have to help on a humanitarian basis before we do anything. We have to get the kids fed. So we've been sending in a lot of food. A lot of the food that's been going there has been sent by the United States. I spoke yesterday with the President of the European Union, Ursula, who was terrific also in the subject, and she's going to play a big role also in helping us. So we have a good group of countries that are going to help with the humanitarian needs, which is food, sanitation and some other things.\n\n(03:21)It's very difficult to deal with Hamas. As I said, we got a tremendous amount of hostages out, but it would take place in drips and drabs. You'd get 10, you'd get five, you'd get two, you'd get 10, 12, we get 12 one time. Many of them would come to the White House and they were so thankful.\n\n(03:39)But I always said, when you get down to the final 10 or 20, you're not going to be able to make a deal with these people because they use them as a shield and when they give them up, they no longer have a shield.\n\n(03:49)And the people of Israel feel so strongly about the hostages. Some people would take a different view, but they feel so strongly about the hostages. So that's an ongoing process.\n\n(04:02)Hamas has become very difficult to deal with in the last couple of days because they don't want to give up these last 20 because they think as long as we have them, they have them, they have protection. But I don't think it can work that way.\n\n(04:16)So I'm speaking to Bibi Netanyahu and we are coming up with various plans. We're going to say it's a very difficult situation. If they didn't have the hostages, things would go very quickly. But they do, and we know where they have them in some cases. And you don't want to go riding roughshod over that area because that means those hostages will be killed.\n\n(04:41)Now there are some people that would say, \"Well, that's the price you pay,\" but we don't like to say that. We don't want to say that. And I don't think the people of Israel want to say that either, which is pretty amazing.\n\n(04:51)A lot of people would say, just get it done and whatever it is. You could also say speed might be better for the hostages, you go through with speed. You may have a better chance because in deep trouble. They're in deep trouble.\n\n(05:06)You saw October 7th and you saw what the damage and the horror that they committed. People can't forget that. They tend to forget it, but they can't forget. That was one of the most evil things I've ever seen and you just cannot forget that.\n\n(05:22)So we're very much involved, the Prime Minister's involved. I'm involved. And I think I can speak, we just signed a very big trade deal, the biggest of them all yesterday. Right?\n\nPrime Minister Keir Starmer (05:31):\n\nYeah.\n\nPresident Donald Trump (05:31):\n\nAnd the European Union is very much involved and wanting to help with really the Palestinians in terms of getting people fed. But the area of Gaza, another way of defining it is the area of Gaza.\n\n(05:49)It's a very troubled place, and it has been for many, many years. It has been for many decades. So it's not like this just happened. This has been on for a long period of time. So that's it.\n\n(06:02)Our hearts are in the right place. We have some good news because the recent war that you just saw, they just announced I see, the newest of the five. Now this would be six that we've stopped. I've stopped six wars in the last… I am averaging about a war a month.\n\n(06:25)But the last three were very close together, India and Pakistan, and a lot of them. Congo was just, and Rwanda was just done. But you probably know, I won't go into it very much because I don't know the final numbers yet. I don't know. Numerous people were killed. And I was dealing with two countries that we get along with very well, very different countries from certain standpoints.\n\n(06:50)They've been fighting for 500 years intermittently. And we solved that war. You probably saw it just came out over the wire, so we solved it through trade. I said, \"I don't want to trade with anybody that's killing each other.\" So we just got that one solved.\n\n(07:07)And I'm going to call the two prime ministers who I got along with very, very well and speak to them right after this meeting and congratulate them. But it was an honor to be involved and it was going to be a very nasty war. Those wars have been very, very nasty.\n\n(07:24)So we've done a lot of good work. We've had great support from the Prime Minister. Anytime we needed help, anytime we needed any form of support, you've been there. We appreciate it very much and we're going to continue onward.\n\n(07:37)We do have to take care of the humanitarian needs on what they used to call the Gaza Strip. You don't hear that line too much anymore. You don't hear the Gaza Strip, but it is the Gaza Strip and it's amazing.\n\n(07:52)It's now being handled a little bit differently. We're going to set up food centers and we're going to do it in conjunction with some very good people and we're going to supply funds.\n\n(08:04)And we just took in trillions of dollars. We've got a lot of money and we're going to spend a little money on some food and other nations are joining us. I know your nation's joining us and we have all of the European nations joining us and others also have called and they want to be helpful.\n\n(08:23)So we're going to set up food centers and where the people can walk in and no boundaries. We're not going to have fences and they can't… They see the food from 30, you would say, yards away, and they see the food. It's all there. But nobody's at it because they have fences set up that nobody can even get it. It's crazy what's going on over there.\n\n(08:45)So we're going to work very closely together with your country, a great country. We also discussed inside that we are, you know there's a whole new thing happening with regard to energy from nuclear.\n\nPrime Minister Keir Starmer (08:59):\n\nYeah.\n\nPresident Donald Trump (09:00):\n\nAnd the Prime Minister is looking at that very strongly. And I know you have Rolls-Royce nuclear plants. That sounds pretty good, right? I love that. What a great brand that is. But you're also doing the Rolls-Royce or the nuclear plants. It's smaller plants.\n\n(09:15)We're doing smaller and bigger, but the small is interesting. They do a small plant, very easy, very safe, and as they need more, they hook up another plant and they have a series of plants. Instead of doing the $20 billion plant, that gets tough for a lot of people to do.\n\n(09:33)So we're just studying that and it sounds like you're very far progressed, but that's a great thing you're doing on nuclear. We opened up nuclear about two months ago and it's now safe and very inexpensive.\n\nPrime Minister Keir Starmer (09:45):\n\nNow we see civil nuclear as a big part of the future as we go to sustainable independent energy. And I think that between the two of us, we can work very much more closely on this.\n\nPresident Donald Trump (09:57):\n\nYes.\n\nPrime Minister Keir Starmer (09:57):\n\nAnd we've agreed that that's our ambition, that's our aspiration, and this is going to be a big part of the future when it comes to energy.\n\n(10:04)And you can see in the last few years, energy has been weaponized. Prices have dictated both families and businesses across the United Kingdom, and therefore taking control of energy is a huge prize.\n\n(10:18)So the more we can work together on this, the better.\n\nPresident Donald Trump (10:20):\n\nRight.\n\nPrime Minister Keir Starmer (10:20):\n\nAnd small modular reactors are a very big part of the future here. And we've got great companies like Rolls-Royce involved in that.\n\n(10:28)So I'm very much looking forward to working together with you, Mr. President.\n\nPresident Donald Trump (10:32):\n\nGood. We'll do that. We'll do that. We're going up to your oil capital in a little while. We're going up to Aberdeen, that's called the oil capital of Europe. And that's a great asset that you have up there someday.\n\n(10:46)If they ever change their thinking on that, you have a great and valuable asset. There's a lot of valuable resources underground there, but that's a decision for you to make.\n\n(10:59)But it's a very amazing place and it is considered the oil capital of Europe, so it's another option that you have.\n\n(11:09)So we are doing really well as a country, and I think that the Prime Minister has been so supportive of us and so strong and so respected, and I respect him much more today than I did before because I just met his wife and family. He's got a perfect wife and family and that's never easy to achieve, right?\n\nPrime Minister Keir Starmer (11:31):\n\nI take no credit for that.\n\nPresident Donald Trump (11:33):\n\nBut he's become a friend. And together we got a deal done that has not been able to be done. It was a deal that's very good for both parties.\n\nPrime Minister Keir Starmer (11:42):\n\nA really good deal for both of our countries and very, very well received here in the United Kingdom.\n\nPresident Donald Trump (11:49):\n\nYeah. So thank you very much for having us.\n\nPrime Minister Keir Starmer (11:50):\n\nThank you.\n\nPresident Donald Trump (11:51):\n\nAppreciate it. Any questions?\n\nJOURNALIST #1 (11:53):\n\nMr. President, [inaudible 00:11:54] about Russia, earlier you said that you were going to change the deadline from 50 days. What is your new deadline, sir?\n\nPresident Donald Trump (12:01):\n\nYes. I'm going to make a new deadline of about 10 or 12 days from today. There's no reason in waiting. There's no reason in waiting. It's 50 days. I want to be generous, but we just don't see any progress being made.\n\nJOURNALIST #2 (12:19):\n\nMr. President, you just talked about setting up food centers in conjunction with other organizations.\n\nPresident Donald Trump (12:25):\n\nRight.\n\nJOURNALIST #2 (12:25):\n\nYou're talking about the Garza Humanitarian Foundation or recognized aid agencies. How will this work?\n\nPresident Donald Trump (12:30):\n\nWell, it's going to be working where the United States will be helping with the food. We have a lot of access to food. We got a lot of food ourselves, and we're going to bring it over there.\n\n(12:40)We're also going to make sure that they don't have barriers stopping people. You've seen the areas where they actually have food and the people are screaming for the food in there. They're 35, 40 yards away and they won't let them because they have lines that are set up. And whether they're set up by Hamas or whoever, but they're very strict lines. So we have to get rid of those lines.\n\n(13:02)But we're going to be getting some good, strong food. We can save a lot of people. I mean, some of those kids are, that's real starvation stuff. I see it. And you can't fake that.\n\n(13:14)So we're going to be even more involved. We did some airlifts before, some air drops, and the people are running for it. And the Prime Minister's going to help us. They're very effective with that. You've done that before. And for many… They've done that for a hundred years very well. So it's not very hard to do, actually. Yes?\n\nJOURNALIST #3 (13:39):\n\nMr. President, you say you love Scotland. You're the most Scottish president ever in the White House. It's not a [inaudible 00:13:42] deal to be done for Scotland, for the Scottish industry and the deal that you've done with the Prime Minister. [inaudible 00:13:50], for example.\n\nPresident Donald Trump (13:51):\n\nWell, I have great love for Scotland. My mother loved Scotland and she loved the Queen. I don't know. I might hurt myself by saying that the Monarchists are going to like it, some other people, but she loved the queen. Whenever the queen was on television, she wanted to watch.\n\n(14:08)And she would come back religiously. She'd come back to Scotland once a year with my sister Maryanne primarily, and sometimes my sister Elizabeth also.\n\n(14:18)But they loved this part of the world. And we're talking about the Isle of Lewis. We're talking about serious Scotland. That's serious Scotland. There was no doubt about it.\n\n(14:30)So yeah, it gives me a feeling… It's different. You go to another country, you have no relationship to it. You got like maybe the head of the country or something.\n\n(14:39)But it's different when your mother was born here, Stornoway; right in Stornoway, a beautiful little place.\n\nJOURNALIST #3 (14:49):\n\nBecause of your love of Scotland, is there a better trade deal to be done for Scottish businesses like whiskey?\n\nPresident Donald Trump (14:55):\n\nI assume when we do our trade deal overall, a lot of it comes through Scotland, I hope. Maybe all of it should go to Scotland.\n\nPrime Minister Keir Starmer (15:02):\n\nIt's a very good deal for the whole United Kingdom. And we're already achieved great things under the deal and we'll achieve even more as we work together.\n\nPresident Donald Trump (15:12):\n\nA lot of it is [inaudible 00:15:13] Scotland. I mean, I do know that. But I mean, we're dealing with the UK, but a lot of it comes to Scotland. And I was very particular. This is a part of the world I want to see thrive. It's going to thrive.\n\nJOURNALIST #1 (15:27):\n\nMr. President, back to Gaza. You talk about Hamas stealing food and stealing aid. What responsibility does Israel have for limiting aid to the region?\n\n(15:37)And if I could ask a follow-up to the Prime Minister, what pressure can be put on Israel? Is that something that you and the United States could work on [inaudible 00:15:44]?\n\nPresident Donald Trump (15:45):\n\nIsrael has a lot of responsibility. They're hampered by the fact that you still have 20 hostages or so. And the people of Israel are very concerned about the 20 hostages. It's very interesting.\n\n(15:57)You could say they could be more concerned about retribution than the 20 hostages, but they really want the 20 hostages to survive and live to make it.\n\n(16:08)Many of the hostages came to my office, the Oval Office, and I was amazed by, I would ask them the question, \"Was there any sign of love?\"\n\n(16:20)When you were a hostage, and you have all of these people from Hamas around you, sometimes a hundred, sometimes 10, sometimes two, but you're a hostage and you're being stored in a pipe. It's not even really a cave. It's a pipe, a little pipe.\n\n(16:36)And some said they didn't think they were going to make it because they were losing air. There wasn't enough air, and they'd open up the pipe just in time, but they didn't do it on purpose. They just happened to open it. They got lucky.\n\n(16:47)But I said, \"Did they ever wink at you and say like, 'Don't worry. You're going to be okay.' Did they ever give you some extra food, even it if was a piece of bread? Did they ever give you anything during that time?\"\n\n(16:58)And some were there for four or 500 days now, right? It's a long time. A year and a half, more than that.\n\n(17:04)And not one person said there was any love from anybody. In other words, you have hundreds of people, and you see it in the movies where somebody's a prisoner and somebody's helping.\n\n(17:16)You even see it with Germany, where people would be led into a house and live in an attic in secret. You'd see signs of something.\n\n(17:27)I said, \"Did you see anything like, did they wink at you? Did they say, 'Don't worry, you're going to be okay.'\"\n\n(17:33)I asked that question all the time. I've never received one answer that said, \"Yeah, they really wanted to help.\" No, the hatred is just incredible.\n\nJOURNALIST #1 (17:42):\n\nThe access to food issue. What more can Israel do and with Congress as well?\n\nPresident Donald Trump (17:49):\n\nWell, I think Israel can do a lot. I will say that Iran, I think, interjected themselves in this last negotiation.\n\n(17:59)Can you imagine the beating they took? We wiped out their nuclear possibilities. They can start again. If they do, we will wipe it out faster than you can wave your finger at it. We'll have to do that. We will do that gladly, openly, and gladly.\n\n(18:15)They've been saying… Iran's been sending out bad signals. I'll tell you, for a country that just got wiped out, they've been sending very bad signals, very nasty signals, and they shouldn't be doing that. They shouldn't be doing that. They were talking about things that they shouldn't be talking about.\n\n(18:33)They were interviewed on a recent show, the Foreign Minister, saying things that he shouldn't be talking about, shouldn't be saying. And I think they got involved in this negotiation telling Hamas and giving Hamas signals and orders, and that's not good. That's not good.\n\nPrime Minister Keir Starmer (18:54):\n\nYeah, I'd like to say, look, we need to get the hostages out. They've been held for a very, very long time, and we must always\n\nPrime Minister Keir Starmer (19:00):\n\nStart from there, but also recognize, the situation on the ground in Gaza is absolutely intolerable. And I think that certainly speaking for the British public and myself, seeing those images of starving children in particular are revolting. And there's a sense of revulsion in the British public at what they're seeing. And they know and we know that humanitarian aid needs to get in at speed at volume. Yes, some could be airdropped and we're working with others with the US, with Jordan on that. But the trucks need to get in because that's the only way you can get the volume in. And we do thank the President for the work he's done to try to get to a ceasefire, which we desperately need, but also to put aid in to the region. There needs to be much more of that, we need to galvanize other countries in support of getting that aid in.\n\n(19:53)And yes, that does involve putting pressure on Israel because absolutely this is a humanitarian catastrophe. Now we also need to look beyond that situation to what then happens in the event of a ceasefire, which is desperately needed. And that's why I'm really pleased that we're having a discussion about what a peace plan would look like after that, the component parts of that. And we have to be really clear at this point that Hamas can play absolutely no part in any future governance in Palestine and in Gaza. And it's really important that we are clear about what triggered this, who took the hostages, and calling out Hamas for what they are, which is a terrorist organization. But I think today the focus has to be on getting that humanitarian aid in.\n\nSpeaker 1 (20:50):\n\nWill the UK avoid your pharmaceutical tariffs and will it happen before August the first?\n\nPresident Donald Trump (20:56):\n\nWell, we'll be announcing on pharmaceuticals sometime in the very near future. We have a very big plan on pharmaceuticals. We want to bring a lot of the pharmaceuticals back to America the way they should be. If you look at COVID, it sort of taught us a lesson. We were getting our pharmaceuticals from other countries, we almost didn't make any. We used to make them ourselves and we're going to want to be making a lot of them ourselves, all of them in a sense. But you also have a good pharmaceutical business. We'll be dealing with you on pharmaceuticals also. And we certainly feel a lot better with your country working on pharmaceuticals for America than some of the other countries. With the relationship we have. You would not use that as a cudgel, you wouldn't be using it as a block. But we're going to be announcing sometime very soon, I think pharmaceuticals, our whole thing. And the companies know and drug prices are going to be coming down very substantially in the US, very, very substantially. And that'll happen very soon.\n\nSpeaker 2 (21:59):\n\nMr. President, we can all sense your frustration with Vladimir Putin.\n\nPresident Donald Trump (22:09):\n\nNo, go ahead.\n\nSpeaker 2 (22:09):\n\nWe can all sense your frustration with Vladimir Putin. Do you think he's been lying to you about his intentions?\n\nPresident Donald Trump (22:11):\n\nWell, I don't want to use the word lying. All I know is we'd have a good talk and on let's say three occasions, it seemed that we were going to have a ceasefire and maybe peace and you divide it up and you do whatever you have to do obviously to get to the end. And all of a sudden missiles are flying into Kiev and other places. And I said, \"What's that all about?\" I spoke to him three, four hours ago and it looked like we were on our way. And then I'd say, \"Forget it, and I'm not going to talk anymore.\" This has happened on too many occasions and I don't like it. I don't like it.\n\nSpeaker 3 (22:49):\n\nMr. President you have successful social media sites. There are new powers here to censor your site, state mandated.\n\nPresident Donald Trump (22:57):\n\nTo censor my site?\n\nSpeaker 3 (22:58):\n\nTo censor your site.\n\nPresident Donald Trump (22:59):\n\nYou mean Truth?\n\nSpeaker 3 (23:02):\n\nI mean Truth. Is that, okay?\n\nPresident Donald Trump (23:02):\n\nWell, I don't think he's going to censor my site because I say only good things. Will you please uncensor my site?\n\nPrime Minister Keir Starmer (23:08):\n\nYeah, we're not censoring anyone. We've got some measures which are there to protect children in particular from sites like suicide sites. We've had too many cases in the United Kingdom of young children taking their own lives. And when you look through their social media, they've been accessing sites which talk about suicide and encouraging, if you like, children down that road. And that is what we want to stop. Nothing about censoring free speech. This country is the proud free speech in this country, has been for a very long time. We're very, very proud of it. We will protect it forever. But at the same time, I personally feel very strongly that we should protect our young teenagers, and that's what it usually is, from things like suicide sites. I don't see that as a free speech issue. I see that as a child protection issue.\n\nPresident Donald Trump (23:59):\n\nWe actually passed a bill in Congress headed up by my wife actually, which was to pull bad stuff out, having to do with children because it is a problem. But I cannot imagine him censoring Truth Social. That's more of a very political and it's been a very big success.\n\nPrime Minister Keir Starmer (24:18):\n\nNot going to happen.\n\nPresident Donald Trump (24:19):\n\nAnd I only say good things about him and his country. So they say to me, \"You're making a mistake after,\" I'm going to give my ambassador to the job, make sure it's not censored.\n\nPrime Minister Keir Starmer (24:28):\n\nIt's not happening.\n\nPresident Donald Trump (24:29):\n\nI had not heard that.\n\nPress (24:30):\n\nYou're a brilliant investor in this area, Mr. President.\n\nPresident Donald Trump (24:34):\n\nSay it?\n\nPress (24:34):\n\nYou're a big investor in this area.\n\nPresident Donald Trump (24:36):\n\nTo put it mildly, like this ballroom that we built from scratch.\n\nPress (24:41):\n\nDo you worry though about the risk increased taxes here? A lot have stopped investing. And do you have a message last out on the soccer to the English Lionesses who won the European trophy?\n\nPresident Donald Trump (24:52):\n\nSo I think that I have a theory that low taxes bring growth. We just passed a big tax cut bill, the biggest bill in the history of our country actually. One Big Beautiful Bill I used to call it The Great One Big Beautiful. We took word great out, but it's actually called the One Big Beautiful Bill. It's essentially a very large tax cut bill for everybody. And our country's, pretty soon, I think I can say it right now, our country's never done better. We had a country that was dead. It was dead six months ago, a year ago. Leaders from NATO, we had a very successful meeting at NATO. Your Prime Minister was there. It was an unbelievable love fest with all of those countries and they agreed to go 5% and all the things, very smart to do.\n\n(25:42)But many of the leaders, essentially they said, \"Your country was dead one year ago.\" And we did, we had a dead country. We had a president who didn't know where the hell he was. We had horrible, horrible people running our country. I think they were sick people actually, sick. You talk about censorship, those are big. All they did was censor, they didn't know what to do. And they had high taxes, they wanted more tax, total censorship, transgender for everybody, men playing in women's sports. Everything bad they wanted and they still do. That's what they still do. That's why they're down at 15% or something. I saw today the lowest that the other part of the Democrats have ever been.\n\n(26:29)But no, I find that when you lower taxes, you get growth. I will say this, and the Prime Minister hasn't been here very long on oil affairs, I think he'll be a tax cutter. But I find that as we cut taxes, we did more business. In my first tax bill, we cut taxes from 39% down to 22%. And we ended up at the end of the first year, the first year, when it was still a little raw, we ended up taking in much more revenue than we did at 39%. It was pretty amazing. And we're taking in a lot of revenue right now and this was an additional tax cut. So I find for whatever it's worth, tax cuts are very good.\n\nSpeaker 4 (27:13):\n\nWe moved up the deadline. It's now 10, 12 days. Is the sanction the same that you're going to slap a hundred percent tariff on anybody who does business with Russia?\n\nPresident Donald Trump (27:20):\n\nSo what I'm doing is we're going to do secondary sanctions unless we make a deal and we might make a deal. I don't know. I don't know, you don't know. We've done so many peace deals. This is the one I started out with. I know President Putin called me. He wanted to know if I could help him with Iran. I said, \"No, I don't need your help with Iran. I need you help with Russia.\" And so that's the one deal that continues to linger. I'm not losing, you're not losing, but 5,000 Russian and Ukrainian kids a week are dying. And that's not mentioning the people that are dying also in towns where he's lobbing missiles into certain towns like Kiev and he's got to make a deal. It's too many people are dying. It's a really bloody war. And the five now they're really telling me that number is obsolete, it's like seven.\n\nPrime Minister Keir Starmer (28:18):\n\nThat's terrible.\n\nPresident Donald Trump (28:19):\n\nSo you have 7,000 Russian and Ukrainian soldiers dying every single week for no reason whatsoever. So you would think based on common sense, you would think he would want to make a deal. We'll find out.\n\nSpeaker 4 (28:31):\n\nMr. President, communication publicly, have you had any other channels, conversations with the Russians reiterating this?\n\nPresident Donald Trump (28:37):\n\nIn what?\n\nSpeaker 4 (28:39):\n\nReiterating this new pressure and deadline?\n\nPresident Donald Trump (28:43):\n\nYeah, I mean well you're the press. I'm reiterating it to you. Yeah, I'd say 10 to 12 days. I'll announce it probably tonight or tomorrow. But there's no reason to wait. If you know what the answer is going to be, why wait? And it would be sanctions and maybe tariffs, secondary tariffs. You know what a secondary tariff is. Look, I don't want to do that to Russia. I love the Russian people. They're great people. I don't want to do that to Russia. But this thing, they're losing a lot of Russians. They've lost a million Russians. And that's the sons and daughters of Russian families. They leave the house, they go \"Bye, Mom, bye, Dad,\" and then they get blown away. And Ukrainian too. Look at Ukraine, it's a disaster what's happened there. But it continues to go on.\n\n(29:41)As you know, we made a deal where the European Union is essentially involved, but it's NATO and we're supplying weapons to NATO. NATO is now paying because the United States, because of Biden's in for $350 billion, the European nations are in for about a hundred billion. Should be the opposite way, by the way, because we have a big ocean in between, should be the opposite way. But I think that eventually something's going to happen. It should happen fast. So many people are dying. When I settled out with Congo and Rwanda, they lost almost 8 million people and it just made so much sense. And if I didn't get involved, they wouldn't have done it. They weren't even thinking about settling it. It was just going on forever. And nobody could go into those territories because they'd get killed. They'd get killed. And now I hear it's a whole different ballgame. We settled it. This is one that should be settled. Russia, Ukraine, this is one that really should be settled.\n\nSpeaker 5 (30:50):\n\nScotland's First Minister has today set out his plans for our second referendum, which is Scottish independence. Can I get your reaction to that as someone with deep ties to Scotland? Sorry, Prime Minister, can I also get your thoughts on that? If you do win a majority of next year's election and they have the right to hold the referendum.\n\nPresident Donald Trump (31:07):\n\nWell, I don't want to get involved in your politics. We got enough politics of our own. I will say that I predicted what was going to happen the last time. You remember? I was opening the first course over at Aberdeen and I was over here and at the same time and they asked me that question. I made a prediction. It was the day before the vote and I like to be correct, but I made a correct prediction. I don't know. I do say that when they made that deal, and I remember this very distinctly, I said, \"Could they do this all the time?\" There was a little bit of a restriction like 50 or 75 years before you could take another vote because a country can't go through that too much. I don't know the first minister, but I've heard great things about him. I've spoken to him, I hear very good things about him and I'm meeting him today. So maybe I'll have a better opinion then.\n\nPrime Minister Keir Starmer (32:05):\n\nAnd let me answer that straightforwardly because I believe in a stronger Scotland, in a better United Kingdom. And I think that at a time like this, when it's quite clear that there's uncertainty and volatility around the world, the strength of the United Kingdom together is very important for all four nations, very important for Scotland. And that should be our priority. That should be our focus. Not on the politics, which feels like the politics of yesteryear now at a time like this. And I think that the first minister should probably focus more on his delivery in Scotland than on his constitutional issues and we might have a better health service in Scotland. But at a time like this, I think the United Kingdom is always stronger as four nations. I think that's better for all four nations. I think that's how Scotland is stronger. Look at the deal that we've been able to do with the United States. A really important deal that we made just months ago. That is what the United Kingdom can do when we act as a powerful set of four nations together. And there are very many other examples.\n\nSpeaker 6 (33:25):\n\nMr. President, you toured the Federal Reserve last week.\n\nPresident Donald Trump (33:28):\n\nI did.\n\nSpeaker 6 (33:32):\n\nAnd it's set to be this week, do you think your visit has inspired a potential rate cut or how you see things shaping out?\n\nPresident Donald Trump (33:37):\n\nOh, it's interesting. I did tour it. I toured the building. And if you looked at this building, if you came here 14, 15 years ago, we've had it a long time. It's been an honor to have Turnberry. But I was on much more opulent walls, ceilings, floors. We had to do this and we did a very great job. I mean, you see how beautiful it is inside. Everything was saved. Everything was preserved. We had ceilings that were in bad shape, they were falling down. It's very old, wasn't properly maintained. Now it's brand new and beautiful and we saved everything.\n\n(34:17)If you really think here, you took a look and you sort of commenting, the coloring, the building. Now this is a brand new building, but if you look outside, it's equally opulent and beautiful. And we didn't do that by spending hundreds of millions of dollars in surrounding a railing underneath the area that you're painting. I've never seen anything like it. Brand new, beautiful plywood, very expensive, wrapped around a figurine or a railing to preserve it. But you don't have to do that. You can just wrap a cloth, they call it a blanket. And you don't even have to do that if you're careful when you're doing the ceiling. But I don't know what they did to take down a ceiling and put up a new ceiling. And the new ceiling had no opulence to it or they'd fix the ceiling. But I would say that all I need is a good plaster and a can of paint. And they spent $3.9 billion. And I spent a lot of money too, but it's, I would say 3.8 billion less. Meaning I spent probably a hundred million dollars making this place incredible.\n\nPrime Minister Keir Starmer (35:33):\n\nAnd you're saying a lot of that was local trades?\n\nPresident Donald Trump (35:35):\n\nI used local trades.\n\nPrime Minister Keir Starmer (35:37):\n\nWe were looking at the windows I think in the next room.\n\nPresident Donald Trump (35:39):\n\nI had local trades do a lot of this. We have the most opulent windows next door. And I had a choice. Do I take them out? They suffered through 125 years of storms. You have very big storms in this area. When you have a storm, you have a storm.\n\nPrime Minister Keir Starmer (35:56):\n\nWe do it properly.\n\nPresident Donald Trump (35:57):\n\nAnd they made it barely, but they were in bad shape. So I had some local people come up and we looked at them. You have some great craftsmen here I think is what you're getting at. And they said, \"Sir, honestly, they've had it. We can copy it and do it much better.\" And they did. If you take a look at the windows in the various dining rooms, they're magnificent and they're new and they're much better looking than what was the same exact look other than a much higher quality. And they're local people. I used a lot of your local people. You have really great local tradesmen here. Yes?\n\nSpeaker 6 (36:37):\n\nDo you foresee a rate cut this week. Do you expect-\n\nPresident Donald Trump (36:39):\n\nA rate cut? Meaning a tax cut?\n\nSpeaker 6 (36:42):\n\nNo, no, no. Do you expect the fed to cut rates this week?\n\nPresident Donald Trump (36:46):\n\nI think he has to. You had 11 cuts. In Europe, they had 11 cuts. In other places, they had 10 or 11 cuts and we had none. But I'm not going to say anything bad. We're doing so well even without the rate cut. With the rate cut, it would be better. It affects our housing a little bit. Look, we should be three points lower. Each point is $360 billion. Can you imagine that? That's big numbers. Each point, one point of cut is the equivalent of $360 billion in savings. That's big stuff. Those are big numbers in the US. Everything's big. He should cut. A smart person would cut. He leaves very soon, so it's like one of those things. But I'll miss him greatly. I'll miss him.\n\nPress (37:43):\n\nTurnberry, if I may, have you or will you enlist the Prime Minister in your effort to bring the open back to Turnberry? And Prime Minister, you described this beautiful course. Do you agree with the President that it's time to bring the Open back to Turnberry?\n\nPrime Minister Keir Starmer (37:54):\n\nWell, as you know, that's not a matter directly for me, that's for the sporting authorities. But look,\n\nPrime Minister Keir Starmer (38:00):\n\nLook, I mean, it is the first time I've been here. It's absolutely magnificent both inside and out. And looking at the courses itself and the building, it's incredible. But the decision on the opening is not a decision for me, as you'll understand. I should just pick up on the earlier question because I, for one, will say congratulations to the Lionesses. Last night our women's football team won the Euros. Well, defended the Euros I should say-\n\nPresident Donald Trump (38:25):\n\nThat's right. That's right. It's a big story.\n\nPrime Minister Keir Starmer (38:26):\n\n… which was a really big success. And the mental and physical resilience that they showed was quite incredible, so-\n\nPresident Donald Trump (38:33):\n\nIt's a big deal.\n\nPrime Minister Keir Starmer (38:34):\n\n… there's a lot of bunting out today and tomorrow to celebrate them bringing that cup home.\n\nPress (38:39):\n\nDid you get the chance to do any planning for the upcoming state visit, and how is that going to work, where would you stay and anything about this?\n\nPresident Donald Trump (38:44):\n\nWell, I'm looking forward to it. It's never been done before twice. We had our original at Buckingham Palace, and now I guess we're going to Windsor?\n\nPrime Minister Keir Starmer (38:52):\n\nWindsor, yeah.\n\nPresident Donald Trump (38:53):\n\nAnd it's never been done. And I'm a big fan of King Charles. I've known him for quite a while. He's a great guy, great person. He looks really well to me. He looks great. So we look forward to coming over. It was one of the most beautiful evenings I've ever seen. I hate to say it, but nobody does it like you people in terms of the pomp and ceremony.\n\nPrime Minister Keir Starmer (39:18):\n\nYeah. It's true.\n\nPresident Donald Trump (39:18):\n\nAnd I look forward to being here with the ambassador. Our ambassador's a very, very successful man who just wanted to do this. And I said, \"How are you going to be able to do that?\" And he's so committed to the relationship between the countries, but he's very great guy and a very, very successful man, so I very much thank you for doing this.\n\nPrime Minister Keir Starmer (39:42):\n\nNo, thank you for the honors.\n\nPress (39:43):\n\nMr. President, will there be a state visit when you go to London or are you worried it's no longer about this?\n\nPresident Donald Trump (39:48):\n\nAbout what?\n\nPress (39:49):\n\nWill you visit London during the state visit or are you worried-\n\nPresident Donald Trump (39:57):\n\nI will. I'm not a fan of your mayor.\n\nPress (39:57):\n\nWhy not?\n\nPresident Donald Trump (39:57):\n\nI think he's done a terrible job, the mayor of London. But a nasty person.\n\nPress (40:01):\n\n[inaudible 00:40:03].\n\nPresident Donald Trump (40:02):\n\nNo, I think he's-\n\nPrime Minister Keir Starmer (40:03):\n\nHe's a friend of mine [inaudible 00:40:06].\n\nPresident Donald Trump (40:06):\n\nNo, I think he's done a terrible job. But I would certainly visit London, yeah.\n\nPress (40:17):\n\n[inaudible 00:40:13]. So MP Nigel Farage has asked for Parliament to be recalled when you're there [inaudible 00:40:19].\n\nPresident Donald Trump (40:18):\n\nWell, I like Nigel. I mean, Nigel, as you know, is a friend of mine. Nigel's done very well. He's a friend of mine. And Keir's a friend of mine.\n\nPress (40:27):\n\nWould you recall Parliament so that the president can talk to MP?\n\nPrime Minister Keir Starmer (40:31):\n\nWell, Parliament's in recess at the time. But look, I do want to be clear, this is an unprecedented and very special state visit. This has never been done before and there'll be many elements of it that have never been seen before. So this is going to be a historic occasion, and we're all very much looking forward to it. And I was very, very pleased to be able to put forward the invitation when we were at the White House earlier this year. So this is not just a state visit. They're always incredible occasions, and this is an unprecedented second state visit. So you can imagine just how special that's going to be.\n\nPresident Donald Trump (41:14):\n\nThe fact that it's never been done before, and that's because it's non-consecutive and it's the only reason it could be, made it even more interesting, frankly. So it's going to be great. And being with Charles and Camilla and everybody I've gotten to know because of four years and now six months, I've gotten to know a lot of the family members. They're great people. They're really great people. And in that sense, I think that the UK is very lucky. You could have people that weren't great people. I don't know if I'd say that, but you could have people that weren't. But-\n\nPrime Minister Keir Starmer (41:48):\n\nWe're very lucky to have our royal family, absolutely fantastic.\n\nPresident Donald Trump (41:51):\n\nSo we really look forward to that. As far as Parliament, if he wants me to speak in Parliament, I'll do it. Okay? But it doesn't have to be then. It could be some other time. Maybe we should save it for another time. We'll let the one visit speak for itself. But anytime if I could be helpful, I would certainly do it. Thank you.\n\nPress (42:08):\n\nMr. President, [inaudible 00:42:09] what kind of alternatives are you considering to get the hostages out if there's no ceasefire?\n\nPresident Donald Trump (42:15):\n\nWell, there are a couple of alternatives. Some are pretty strong. But the most sensible alternative is talk and negotiation. But I said a long time ago, at a certain point they're not going to be talking because they're going to lose their shield. The hostages are a shield for them. They did horrible things on October 7th, and the hostages are a shield. And I said, \"You're going to get down a number and the number's going to be at a point where you're not going to be able to get them back unless you're going to be very energetic, or to put it a different way, unless you're going to be very ruthless and violent.\" It's a bad situation to be in. Very bad.\n\nPress (43:00):\n\nMr. President, with the EU deal last night-\n\n(43:02)You talked during the campaign about President Putin respecting you and that helping you have a relationship with him. Do you still feel that way, that he respects you, considering the conversations you've had that have been really [inaudible 00:43:15]?\n\nPresident Donald Trump (43:14):\n\nYeah, I've always gotten along with President Putin. I had a great relationship with him. And he went through the Russia, Russia, Russia hoax too. I mean, we used to talk about it. We used to say, \"It's too bad we really can't do anything between our country.\" Because if we did, they'd say, \"Oh…\" Look, I was tough on Putin because I was the one that closed up Nord Stream, and Biden came along and opened it up. I was very tough on Putin in one way, but we got along very well and I never really thought this would happen. I thought we'd be able to negotiate something. And maybe that'll still happen, but it's very late down the process. So I'm disappointed.\n\n(43:56)And the funny thing is that their economy isn't that big and it's having a hard time right now, but it's a relatively small economy. A strong military but strong economy. And it used to be a strong economy. Now it's not. He's going through a lot economically. It's not easy. But it's pretty small compared to that magnificent size of that land. The land is massive. It's got, I guess, nine time zones or something. It's a massive piece of land.\n\n(44:27)Russia could be so rich. It could be so rich. It could be thriving like practically no other country. And they're holding that back because he wants to do trade deals with us. He talks about it all the time. He wanted to. And I envision that a lot of trade with Russia… They have a lot of valuable things. When you talk about rare earth, they have serious rare earth. They have just about every form you can have. So Russia could be so rich right now. Instead, they spend all their money on war. They spend everything on war and killing people, and it doesn't make sense to me. I thought he would want end this thing quickly. I really felt it was going to end. But every time I think it's going to end, he kills people.\n\nPress (45:16):\n\nCould a meeting help and are you considering… as been proposed [inaudible 00:45:20]?\n\nPresident Donald Trump (45:19):\n\nI don't know. I'm not so interested in talking anymore. He talks… We have such nice conversations, such respectful and nice conversations. And then people die the following night with a missile going into a town and hitting… I mean, recently I guess the nursing home, but they hit other things. Whatever they hit, people die. So I don't know. We'll see what happens.\n\nPress (45:48):\n\nWe just had a sense of your differences in political persuasion with Nigel Farage and Sadiq Khan in the conversation. I wonder if you have any advice, either of you, for a very divided, polarized world on how you make [inaudible 00:46:00] relationships [inaudible 00:46:01]?\n\nPresident Donald Trump (46:00):\n\nNot differences. Yeah, not differences. I happen to like both men. I like this man a lot. And I like Nigel. And I don't know the politics over here. I don't know where they stand. I would say one's slightly liberal, not that liberal, slightly. And the other one is slightly conservative, but they're both good men.\n\nPress (46:25):\n\nMr. President [inaudible 00:46:27]-\n\nPrime Minister Keir Starmer (46:27):\n\nLook, we like each other. We respect each other. We get on. And we've both got a great love of our countries, of our families, and therefore there's a huge amount that we have already achieved, actually, together and will achieve as we go forward leading our respective countries and of course the relationship between our countries. Donald, we were talking about this this morning that whether it's defense, security, intelligence sharing, it's a close, historic relationship. We have fought together in the past. We've always stood together. And I, for one am very pleased that we've got such a good personal relationship between us. And I think it just shows that even if you come from different political perspectives, different backgrounds, actually, there's a huge amount of common ground when it comes to what is in the best interests of our two great countries. And they are two great countries. And I think that because we focus on what's best for our countries, we get along very well. And I'm really pleased that that's the case.\n\nPress (47:32):\n\nMr. President-\n\nPresident Donald Trump (47:32):\n\nWell, I do know he wants to cut taxes as much as he can. And politics is pretty simple. I assume there's a thing going on between you and Nigel, and it's okay. It's two parties. But generally speaking, the one who cuts taxes the most, the one who gives you the lowest energy prices and the best kind of energy, the one that keeps you out of wars, he's kept you out of wars, but the one that keeps you out of wars. You have a few basics. And you can go back a thousand years, a million years, whoever does these things… But low taxes, keep us safe, keep us out of wars, no crime, stop the crime. And in your case, a big immigration component because I know that your attitude has become strong on immigration, strong on the toughness of immigration.\n\n(48:23)But I think whoever's going to be… I think I won because of… I think I won because we had a lousy president, to be honest with you. We had an incompetent president. But I won because of I was very strong on immigration. Now we had inflation. We had sort of a bad economy with this guy. We had a lot of problems. But I focused on immigration more than I did anything else. And I think I won because of immigration. I think I won because of the border. I had a bad border where millions of people were coming into our country illegally. And as you know, in last month, zero people came into our country illegally. Zero. So we went from a bad incompetently run border to the most competently run border that anybody's ever seen.\n\nPress (49:08):\n\nThe president makes it look easy dealing with illegal migration. You must be envious of his record in such a short period.\n\nPrime Minister Keir Starmer (49:16):\n\nWell, I think we've been discussing irregular illegal migration is a huge issue in both of our countries. In the United Kingdom it is a real cause for concern, and that's why we must bear down on it in all its aspects upstream across Europe where a lot of ours comes into through northern France, across the channel, working with our allies, with our colleagues to break the gangs that are actually running this trade. But equally being very strong that when people have arrived in this country who've got no right to be here, then we should be removing them to their own country. And that's why I'm really pleased that we've been able to focus on this very intensely and get 35,000 people out of the United Kingdom having no right to be here. Because the message has to be, you can't make your way to the United Kingdom. We won't tolerate our rules being broken. And if you get here, you will be returned to where you came from. And it's really important that we bear down on that.\n\nPress (50:22):\n\nWith such an attractive place, people come because they want better life because we are a wonderful country.\n\nPrime Minister Keir Starmer (50:28):\n\nPeople coming via the rules are always welcome. But of course we've welcomed talent and people into this country for centuries, literally. But what the British people will not tolerate is those that break the rules, those that come through irregular routes. And that's the really important distinction here, and that's what we're bearing down on. And I'm really pleased that through pretty well all of the international engagement I've done, all the meetings I've had, the country we've done deals with… We've done deals with countries in the last 12 months that many people thought it was not possible to deal with when it came to immigration, irregular immigration. And we've returned thousands of people who've got no right to be here.\n\n(51:16)And that I think is… For the British people, we're a reasonable tolerant country where people are coming lawfully to contribute to our communities, to our country. Then of course they're welcome and have made a great contribution. But what people will not tolerate is those that are breaking the rules. And that is an issue of today, but it's a very British thing. We are people who respect rules. We don't approve of those that break rules.\n\nPress (51:49):\n\nMr. President-\n\nPresident Donald Trump (51:50):\n\nI can say though that I had one of the greatest victories. They say the most consequential in 129 years. I don't know about that, but it was pretty close. And we won all of the swing states, which never happens. We won the popular vote by millions of votes. We won tremendous electoral college sweep. And I believe I did it more than anything else because of my strong stand on immigration. And I don't think this country's any different in that sense. I think it's a big factor. And it is with a lot of the European countries. Some of the countries have lost their way and they have tremendous crime because of it.\n\n(52:29)I mean, you had countries with no crime that now have tremendous crime. And you know the countries, and I know the countries. And so I think it's a huge factor in any election, not just this election, but in any election. I think the one that's toughest and most competent on immigration is going to win the election. But then you add low taxes and you add the economy. He did a great thing with the economy because a lot of money's going to come in because of the deal that was made. But I think that immigration is now bigger than ever before.\n\nPress (53:06):\n\nMr. President, your treasury secretary, is meeting with Chinese trade-\n\nPresident Donald Trump (53:09):\n\nRight now.\n\nPress (53:11):\n\nRight now. Have you received an update? Do you expect a deal when these talks are over? [inaudible 00:53:16].\n\nPresident Donald Trump (53:16):\n\nKnow they're meeting right now and we have a good relationship with China, but China's tough, and like you're tough. We're all tough, I guess. But we're going to see what happens. We just concluded our deal with Japan. It was very good, good for everybody. We're making great deals. We're making deals that are good for us, but we want them to be good for everybody. It's important. Sometimes I'll do something that I shouldn't do because it's not very important for our country, but it's very meaningful for the country on the other side. And I'll let them have that point because it's very important for them. So I don't know.\n\n(54:03)But we've made a lot of deals in the last couple of months. And then ultimately, as you might as well know, we're going to just… You have 200 countries, more, but people don't know that. You got a lot of countries. And I wouldn't want to sit down with 200 people to have to deal the way… He was calling me all the time. \"We want this. We got to have that. These are tough negotiators. Look, they're smart people. They're tough negotiators. They know what they want.\n\n(54:31)But we're going to be setting a tariff for essentially the rest of the world, and that's what they're going to pay if they want to do business in the United States. Because you can't sit down and make 200 deals. But we've made the big ones. We just finished Indonesia. They opened up their country. We just finished Japan. They opened up their country. Japan opened up the country. They were totally closed. They opened it up to our cars, even to rice. Rice was a big deal. They would never take anybody else's rice. They're taken rice. But they opened up their country. Philippines we just finished. They opened up their country. They were very closed. I'd love to see China open up their country. So we're dealing with China right now as we speak. Yeah, we're dealing with China right now.\n\nPress (55:20):\n\nThe deal you've got with UK is better than the one with the European Union. Is that because you think Brexit [inaudible 00:55:26] this country?\n\nPresident Donald Trump (55:28):\n\nLook, we have a very special relationship with this country. My mother was born here. And not only born here, loved it. She'd come back, I told you, religiously every year. And she'd go up to Stornoway and see her relatives. But she loved the country. Yeah, that probably has… It always has an impact. Always has an impact. But Germany has a new leader, and I think he's terrific. I think you like him too.\n\nPrime Minister Keir Starmer (56:00):\n\nYeah. Yeah, we get along.\n\nPresident Donald Trump (56:00):\n\nI think he's terrific. My father was born in Germany. Or Germany was… His parents said, \"We're just out.\" So you have a lot of feeling for this part of the world. I do. I want to see this part of the world do well. Germany, Scotland, the UK. I want this part of the world to do well, all of the nations. You do feel a certain… You have a feeling, a warm feeling toward a part when your parents are born, essentially here, and oh, I think maybe it's slightly different. Maybe it's not. I don't know. But maybe it's slightly different.\n\nPress (56:42):\n\nMr. President, you didn't completely rule out a pardon for Ghislaine Maxwell when you landed, is that something you would ever consider and why?\n\nPresident Donald Trump (56:48):\n\nPardon for who?\n\nPress (56:49):\n\nFor Ghislaine Maxwell.\n\nPresident Donald Trump (56:51):\n\nWell, I'm allowed to give her a pardon-\n\nPress (56:52):\n\nYeah, you are.\n\nPresident Donald Trump (56:53):\n\n… but nobody's approached me with it. Nobody's asked me about it. It's\n\nPresident Donald Trump (57:00):\n\n… in the news about that aspect of it, but right now it would be inappropriate to talk about it, so…\n\nPress (57:09):\n\nMr. President, Mr. President, your opposition to offshore wind is well-known, and Scotland-\n\nPresident Donald Trump (57:15):\n\nWind is a disaster.\n\nPress (57:16):\n\nBut in Scotland and across the UK wind farm is [inaudible 00:57:18]-\n\nPresident Donald Trump (57:18):\n\nI know, it's a shame. It's not his fault. I used to tell Alex Salmon.\n\nPress (57:27):\n\nHave you spoken to the Prime Minister, and will you speak to the [inaudible 00:57:27]-\n\nPresident Donald Trump (57:27):\n\nWell, all I can do is give my word. Look, wind is the most expensive form of energy, and it destroys the beauty of your fields and your plains and your waterways. Look out there, there's no windmills. But if you look in another direction, you see windmills. When we go to Aberdeen, you'll see some of the ugliest windmills you've ever seen, they're the height of a 50-story building. And you can take 1000 times more energy out of a hole in the ground this big. This big, it's called oil and gas. And you have it there, the North Sea. This big that nobody would even see.\n\n(58:12)You can take 1000 times more power because the wind is intermittent, it doesn't work, it's extremely expensive. All the windmills are made in China. They used to be Germany and China, now they're mostly in China. They all come out of China. They say that the blades which are carbon fiber, you can't bury. Oh, okay, you can't bury. What are you going to do, dump them in the ocean someplace? Because they only last a certain period of time. And remember, a windmill has a life of eight years, especially when they're out in the salty sea, and they start to rot and to rust. You're going to have to replace them, it's very hard to replace them.\n\n(58:51)Wind needs massive subsidy, and you are paying in Scotland and in UK and all over the place where they have them, massive subsidies to have these ugly monsters all over the place. So I've restricted windmills in the United States. Now, a couple. We have the poor, stupid people at the beginning they approved them, so they have their full approvals. But I've restricted windmills in the United States because they also kill all your birds, they wipe out. It's interesting, if you shoot a bald eagle in the United States, they put you in jail for five years. And yet windmills knock out hundreds of them, they don't do anything. You explained that. So it's a very expensive energy, it's a very ugly energy, and we won't allow it in the United States.\n\nPrime Minister Keir Starmer (59:40):\n\nSo we believe in a mix. And obviously oil and gas is going to be with us for a very long time, and that'll be part of the mix. But also wind, solar, increasingly nuclear, which is what we've been discussing this morning, civil nuclear as we go forward. The most important thing for the United Kingdom is that we have control of our energy, and we have energy independence and security. Because at the moment, whatever the attributes and facilities in the North Sea, that is sold onto the international market, and we buy back off the international market, that was a historic mistake in my view. But what we need is a mix so that we get the energy security that we need for the future. And that's the focus of everything that we are doing.\n\n(01:00:26)But what we have discussed today is that the energy prices are too high, which is why we recently took measures to reduce the energy prices, particularly for energy-intensive businesses. But in the long run, the only way to reduce your energy price is to take control of your energy. And that's what we're doing, taking control of our energy.\n\nPress (01:00:45):\n\nMr President. Our King Charles, who you great friend of big as big fan of [inaudible 01:00:52] windmills, as you call them. Is he wrong?\n\nPresident Donald Trump (01:00:55):\n\nSo King Charles is an environmentalist, I will tell you. And I say that in a positive way, not a negative way. And every time I've met with him, he talked about the environment, how important it is. And I'm all for it, I think that's great. King Charles more than anything else, loves the country, but I got to know him very well. He truly is an environmentalist. He wants clean air, clean water, all of the things that we all want.\n\nPress (01:01:22):\n\nMr. President. You have said that you have not been briefed on the Epstein files, or your name does not appeared in the Epstein files. But doesn't the AG have to tell you if your name is?\n\nPresident Donald Trump (01:01:34):\n\nWell, I haven't been overly interested in it. It's something, it's a hoax that's been built up way beyond proportion. I can say this, those files were run by the worst scum on earth. They were run by Comey, they were run by Garland, they were run by Biden. And all of the people that actually ran the government, including the autopen. Those files were run for four years by those people. If they had anything, I assume they would've released it. The whole thing is a hoax. They ran the files, I was running against somebody that ran the files. If they had something they would've released.\n\n(01:02:15)Now, they can easily put something in the files that's a phony. Like as an example, Christopher Steele, a person well happens to be from your country. But Christopher Steele as an example, wrote a book, a dossier, we call it the Fake News Dossier. And the whole thing was a fake. The whole thing was a fake. They can put things in the file that are fake, but those files were run by bad sick people. If they had anything, why didn't they use it when I was killing Joe. And then he gave out because he was 25 points down, and then I got somebody new, nobody even knew anything about her. She was a horrible vice president. She was our Border Czar, but she never went to the border, she never once called the border patrol agent to find out how we're done. But she was the border czar, her name was Kamala. Nobody knows her last name, it was Harris. But nobody knew her last name.\n\n(01:03:11)So I ended up, how would you like to end up in a race where you're killing somebody, you're beating himself. And then they say, \"All right, we'll take him out, he's not working. Let's put somebody else. And then she had a six-week honeymoon. It was amazing, they predicted she will have a six-week honeymoon and she did. And then she got slaughtered. But think of it, those files were run by these people. They were run by my enemy. If there was anything in there, they would've used them for the election.\n\nPress (01:03:48):\n\nDo you think that drawing… I think I heard you say something the other day that the drawing that was as subject to the Wall Street Journal report [inaudible 01:03:48]-\n\nPresident Donald Trump (01:03:48):\n\nI don't do drawings. I'm not a drawing person.\n\nPress (01:03:51):\n\nDo you think it was fraudulent-\n\nPresident Donald Trump (01:03:51):\n\nI don't do drawings-\n\nPress (01:03:52):\n\n[inaudible 01:03:53] name or-\n\nPresident Donald Trump (01:03:52):\n\nSometimes people say, \"Would you draw a building?\" And I'll draw four lines and a little roof for a charity stuff. But I'm not a drawing person. I don't do drawings of women that I can tell you. They say there's a drawing of a woman, and I don't do drawings of women. And also Epstein was always a very controversial guy. I was at a very high position pretty much all my life. In all fairness, I've been doing this for a long time. I had the top show on television, I had the number one bestsellers, I had everything, right? And I was a very successful business guy. He was a very controversial. Who would do a controversial drawing?\n\n(01:04:32)Now, with that being said, they say there were many letters done by many people. And many big people, big successful people. When you talk about files, I just keep going back, and other people too. Even the enemy says this thing is not correct. Because if we had it, we would've used it on the guy. It's a bad issue. They say it's a good issue for Trump. Do you know that my poll numbers are up 4.5 points since this ridiculous Epstein stuff? My poll numbers have gone up 4.5 points because people don't buy it. Okay, people don't buy it. And he's gone, and we want to focus on trade deals, I want to focus on the deal we just made with the European Union, which is the biggest trade deal in history. It's the biggest deal I think in history, not just trade deal. So if they would've had something, they would've used it.\n\nPress (01:05:30):\n\nAnd people keep writing stories about the time you threw him out of Mar-a-Lago, can you settle that? What was it about? What caused the breach for him?\n\nPresident Donald Trump (01:05:37):\n\nThat's such old history. Very easy to explain, but I don't want to waste your time by explaining it. But for years I wouldn't talk to Jeffrey Epstein. I wouldn't talk because he did something that was inappropriate. He hired help. And I said, \"Don't ever do that again.\" He stole people that worked for me. I said, \"Don't ever do that again.\" He did it again and I threw him out of the place, persona non grata. I threw him out and that was it. I'm glad I did, if you want to know the truth.\n\nPress (01:06:08):\n\nMr. President.\n\n(01:06:08)Mr. President.\n\nPresident Donald Trump (01:06:09):\n\nAnd by the way, I never went to the island, and Bill Clinton went there supposedly 28 times. I never went to the island, but Larry Summers I hear went there, he was the head of Harvard. And many other people that are very big people, nobody ever talks about them. I never had the privilege of going to his island. And I did turn it down, but a lot of people in Palm Beach were invited to his island. In one of my very good moments, I turned it down, I didn't want to go to his island. Yeah.\n\nPress (01:06:39):\n\nMr President. On Gaza, next time you speak to Netanyahu, what will you ask him to do?\n\nPresident Donald Trump (01:06:43):\n\nSay what? Louder.\n\nPress (01:06:44):\n\nNext time you speak to Netanyahu, what will you ask him to do to [inaudible 01:06:48]-\n\nPresident Donald Trump (01:06:47):\n\nWell, I'm going to say, \"Look, we're giving money and we're giving food, but we're over here in the United States, and I think I could speak for the Prime Minister. We're giving money and things, he's got to sort of run it.\n\nPress (01:07:00):\n\nWhat should he do?\n\nPresident Donald Trump (01:07:01):\n\nwell.,I want them to make sure they get the food.\n\nPress (01:07:03):\n\nOpen.\n\nPresident Donald Trump (01:07:04):\n\nI want to make sure they get the food, every ounce of food. I think you want the same thing.\n\nPrime Minister Keir Starmer (01:07:09):\n\nYeah, absolutely. It's an absolute [inaudible 01:07:10]-\n\nPresident Donald Trump (01:07:09):\n\nBecause that food is a being delivered.\n\nPress (01:07:11):\n\nMr. President-\n\nPresident Donald Trump (01:07:12):\n\n… or at least all of it.\n\nPress (01:07:13):\n\n… you said you were going to set essentially tariff for the [inaudible 01:07:17], for the rest of the world-\n\nPresident Donald Trump (01:07:18):\n\nFor the world.\n\nPress (01:07:19):\n\nWhat percent will that tariff be?\n\nPresident Donald Trump (01:07:21):\n\nI would say it'll be somewhere in the 15 to 20% range.\n\nPress (01:07:25):\n\nSo maybe 15 or 20 or?\n\nPresident Donald Trump (01:07:29):\n\nNo, I sort of know, but I just want to be nice. I would say in the range of 15 to 20%.\n\nPress (01:07:37):\n\n[inaudible 01:07:36] make to UK steel-\n\nPresident Donald Trump (01:07:38):\n\nProbably one of those two numbers.\n\nPress (01:07:40):\n\n[inaudible 01:07:40] but UK and steel aluminum makers here are worried about them tariff, will you do anything to help them here?\n\nPresident Donald Trump (01:07:40):\n\nAluminum?\n\nPress (01:07:40):\n\nAnd steel.\n\nPresident Donald Trump (01:07:46):\n\nYou're pretty big aluminum maker.\n\nPrime Minister Keir Starmer (01:07:48):\n\nYeah. That's already covered in the deal that we've agreed, so we're just doing the implementation of that.\n\nPress (01:07:54):\n\nBut Mr. President, when will that come down from 25% to zero?\n\nPresident Donald Trump (01:07:56):\n\nYou mean the overall, on the world?\n\nPress (01:08:00):\n\nOn steel aluminum from Britain, it's 25.\n\nPresident Donald Trump (01:08:04):\n\nWell, we're going to know pretty soon, we're going to have it pretty soon that…\n\nPress (01:08:07):\n\nMr. President, I'm sure you-\n\nPresident Donald Trump (01:08:08):\n\nYou have no idea that these people are tough negotiators, okay. But we're a big buyer of steel, but we're going to make our own steel, and we're going to make our old aluminum for the most part. But we buy a lot of aluminum from right here, and a lot of steel too.\n\nPrime Minister Keir Starmer (01:08:22):\n\nYeah.\n\nPresident Donald Trump (01:08:23):\n\nWho are you with? Who are you with? Because you're asking such a nice question.\n\nPress (01:08:26):\n\nTV News, [inaudible 01:08:26] TV News.\n\nPresident Donald Trump (01:08:26):\n\nVery good. Good. They're lucky.\n\nPress (01:08:26):\n\nWe have a lot of unhappy farmers in this country at the moment, and I'm sure the [inaudible 01:08:34] for raising this. We've had changes to the terrorist attacks, which mean lot farmers we have are going to heir farms when they die of [inaudible 01:08:41]. How important are farmers to a country?\n\nPresident Donald Trump (01:08:46):\n\nYou mean they're going to lose the farm because of estate taxes?\n\nPress (01:08:49):\n\nCorrect. So when they-\n\nPresident Donald Trump (01:08:50):\n\nSo what I've done-\n\nPress (01:08:52):\n\n[inaudible 01:08:52] pay so much, they're cash poor, but they have great [inaudible 01:08:54]-\n\nPresident Donald Trump (01:08:54):\n\nI know. Well, they're cash poor. They're land rich and cash poor. I've had that too. Sometimes I'm land rich and cash… Sometimes I'm cash and land-poor. I like it both ways, but as they get older, I like the more conservative, right? So I did something that I don't know if you can do, but it was great. I love our farmers. As you know in our tax bill, we have a clause that's very important. We were losing a lot of farms to the banks because a loving mother and father would die, and left their farm to their children or their child, but their children, their family. And they loved their family and they thought they were doing them a favor, but they had a 50% tax to pay. So the land would get valued at a high number because some of the farms were valuable, but they couldn't quantify it. And they go out and borrow money to pay the estate tax, or the death taxes it's called. And they'd overextend and they'd lose the farm, and they'd commit suicide in many cases.\n\nPress (01:10:05):\n\nWe're seeing that.\n\nPresident Donald Trump (01:10:05):\n\nYou have that.\n\nPrime Minister Keir Starmer (01:10:05):\n\nNo, no, no, no. Our levels are nowhere near 50%.\n\nPress (01:10:05):\n\nThey're not 50% but [inaudible 01:10:06]-\n\nPrime Minister Keir Starmer (01:10:06):\n\nWe've just introduced where it's paid over many years works out about-\n\nPresident Donald Trump (01:10:10):\n\nWell, that's good.\n\nPrime Minister Keir Starmer (01:10:10):\n\n… an extra 2% a year over 10 years. So it's not at those levels by any stretch of the imagination. But the other thing that we've done as you know, is make sure that we've got a pathway for farmers that actually increases their year-on-year income, which is the most important thing. And in all of the deals that we do, we ensure that our farmers are the central focus for much of it, particularly on the agriculture-\n\nPresident Donald Trump (01:10:36):\n\nThat's good.\n\nPrime Minister Keir Starmer (01:10:36):\n\n… I mean, including in the U.S. deal, because I don't think we can go on for years saying that it's acceptable for farmers to have a year-on-year income, which isn't sufficient. We've got to fix that problem, we can't simply live with that problem. So it's a very different situation.\n\nPresident Donald Trump (01:10:52):\n\nWell, we ended the estate tax. There is no estate tax on farmers.\n\nPress (01:10:57):\n\n[inaudible 01:10:57] you're saying-\n\nPresident Donald Trump (01:10:58):\n\nSo when a parent leaves their farm, because again, a lot of these farms they don't make a lot of money, but it's a way of life and they love their way of life, and they love that dirt. That dirt is the most beautiful thing they've ever seen, they love it. I mean, they're farmers, they love doing. They don't know how to do anything else, but they don't want to do anything else. I speak to farmers, they say, \"Would you like to live in my penthouse in Manhattan? It's always beautiful.\" \"No sir, I want this farm.\"\n\n(01:11:24)Now, what happens is, I mean, we were losing a lot of people to suicide. They'd borrow money to pay the estate tax, and they were not able to pay it. And some banks are ruthless, they wouldn't do anything. And they would end up committing suicide. We have totally ended the estate tax in those situations. So there's no estate tax. So when a parent leaves the farm to the kids, they don't have to worry about their local, possibly unfriendly banker coming in and stealing their farm.\n\nPress (01:11:57):\n\nMr. President, on [inaudible 01:12:02] migration. One of the factors that are huge in Britain is migrants being housed in hotels, and people in the communities not feeling safe. Is that an appropriate [inaudible 01:12:09]-\n\nPresident Donald Trump (01:12:10):\n\nI don't like anything about it. They shouldn't be allowed in. Anybody illegally should not be allowed in the country. Thank you all very much.\n\nPress (01:12:25):\n\nMr. President. Thank you.\n\nPresident Donald Trump (01:12:29):\n\nThank you.\n\nPress (01:12:29):\n\nThank you for doing this [inaudible 01:12:30].\n\n(01:12:29)Take everything.\n\nPresident Donald Trump (01:12:29):\n\nThank you.\n\nPress (01:12:29):\n\n[inaudible 01:12:30].\n\n(01:12:29)Thank you.\n\n(01:12:29)Thank you.",

    "transcript": "Donald Trump (00:00):\n\nThank you very much. So we have good news. We've reached a deal. It's a good deal for everybody, I believe. And it's, I think you were saying this is probably the biggest deal ever reached in any capacity, trade or beyond trade.\n\nUrsula von der Leyen (00:18):\n\nIt is.\n\nDonald Trump (00:20):\n\nIt's a giant deal with lots of countries because as you know, Ursula represents a lot of countries, not one country. It's not easy for you. It's a lot of very different countries, great countries. But some are strong with cars, some are strong with agriculture, some are strong with both. Right? You have a lot of different factors. So we're going to do the following. The European Union is going to agree to purchase from the United States $750 billion worth of energy, $750 billion worth of energy. They are going to agree to invest into the United States $600 billion more than they're investing already. So they're investing a large amount of money. You know what that amount of money is. It's very substantial. But they're going to invest an additional $600 billion.\n\n(01:28)They're agreeing to open up their countries to trade at zero tariff, so that's a very big factor, opening up their countries. All of the countries will be opened up to trade with the United States at zero tariff. And they're agreeing to purchase a vast amount of military equipment. We don't know what that number is but it's… The good news is we make the best military equipment in the world, so you have to do that, I mean, until somebody tops us, which is not going to happen. We're way ahead of every other country in terms of the quality of the military equipment. You saw that recently in Iran. And you see that, unfortunately you see that often for all the wrong reasons. So those things are 750 billion, 600 billion, opening up the country.\n\n(02:23)We are agreeing that the tariff straight across for automobiles and everything else will be a straight across tariff of 15%. So we have a tariff of 15%. We have the opening up of all of the European countries, which I think I could say were essentially closed. I mean, you weren't exactly taking our autos, you weren't exactly taking our agriculture. And then you would have smaller things, but for the most part it was closed. And now it's open. It's open for our companies to go in and do a good job with it. I think you'll like them. I think you'll like it. And we will, very importantly, they'll be investing a lot of money, but the military is a big number, but that's one number we're not determining. It's going to be whatever it is, but they're going to be purchasing hundreds of billions of dollars worth of military equipment.\n\n(03:23)They're, very importantly, they're going to purchase $750 billion worth of energy, so that's going to be great, and $600 billion worth of investments into the United States over and above what they have. And I think that basically concludes the deal. Those are the main factors. I don't think there are too many other factors, other than we're going to get along great. We have a great relationship now with NATO, which is largely the same. Not exactly, but pretty close, largely. And with NATO, as you know, they're going up to 5% from 2%. And the relationship is very strong with NATO. So I just want to congratulate you. I think it's great that we made a deal today instead of playing games and maybe not making a deal at all. I think it's, I'm going to let you say, but I think it's the biggest deal ever made. Thank you very much. Congratulations.\n\nUrsula von der Leyen (04:25):\n\nThank you very much. Thank you. Yeah, thank you. We have a deal. We have a trade deal between the two largest economies in the world. And it's a big deal. It's a huge deal. It will bring stability, it will bring predictability. That's very important for our businesses on both sides of the Atlantic. It's 15% tariffs across the board, all-inclusive. The investments Mr. President just described that going to go to the United States and the purchases over there. Indeed, basically the European market is open. It's 450 million people. So it's a good deal. It's a huge deal with tough negotiations. I knew it at the beginning and it was indeed very tough, but we came to good conclusions for both sides. So again, congratulations and many thanks.\n\nDonald Trump (05:28):\n\nThank you very much.\n\nUrsula von der Leyen (05:28):\n\nThank you.\n\nDonald Trump (05:29):\n\nDo you have any questions please?\n\nSpeaker 3 (05:29):\n\nHow did you come to a deal so quickly? Did the European Union come bearing gifts?\n\nDonald Trump (05:39):\n\nI think we both wanted to make a deal. You said something that is very important. It's going to bring us closer together. I think this deal will bring us very close together actually. It's a partnership in a sense. But it's a very good point and it's something that's very important.\n\nSpeaker 4 (05:59):\n\nBut was there one issue that you needed to get over the hurdle, one, pharmaceuticals, metals?\n\nDonald Trump (06:03):\n\nNo. We had four or five. No, no, not pharmaceuticals. I mean, we're going to be, as you know, a lot of companies are coming into the US and that's unrelated to this deal. But I think this didn't just start today. We had a meeting. I wasn't sure. I said 50/50. I think you probably felt the same thing.\n\nUrsula von der Leyen (06:24):\n\nYeah.\n\nDonald Trump (06:24):\n\nBut this started months ago, this negotiation. So we knew pretty much what we were getting into. And we were able to make a deal that's very satisfactory to both sides. So tremendously it's a very powerful deal. It's a very big deal. It's the biggest of all the deals. It will be the biggest of all the deals. We're very honored to have done so. And your staff has been fantastic, and they've worked together very long and hard.\n\nUrsula von der Leyen (06:54):\n\nThey worked hard and long. And many thanks to the teams on both sides. There was, as I said at the beginning, a heavy lifting we had to do. But many thanks also for the talks we had many times on the way to our goal. And now we made it, and that's good.\n\nDonald Trump (07:14):\n\nWe made it.\n\nUrsula von der Leyen (07:14):\n\nThat's really good.\n\nDonald Trump (07:17):\n\nWe made it. Anybody else? Yes, ma'am.\n\nSpeaker 5 (07:25):\n\nI have a question for the EU president. What are the US concessions? What is the US giving up in the deal, if anything?\n\nUrsula von der Leyen (07:27):\n\nSo as the starting point was an imbalance, a surplus on our side and a deficit on the US side. And we wanted to rebalance the trade relation and we wanted to do it in a way that trade goes on between the two of us across the Atlantic, because the two biggest economies should have a good trade flow between us. And I think we hit exactly the point we wanted to find, rebalance but enable trade on both sides, which means good jobs on both sides of the Atlantic, means prosperity on both sides of the Atlantic. And that was important for us.\n\nDonald Trump (08:06):\n\nAnd again, the energy is a very important component because we have more energy than anybody else in that sense. And I think it was very wise. They buy a lot of energy. And it's great stuff and it solves a lot of problems. So that was a great decision, I think.\n\nSpeaker 6 (08:32):\n\nWhat about steel, what have you done for [inaudible 00:08:33]?\n\nDonald Trump (08:33):\n\nOn what?\n\nSpeaker 6 (08:33):\n\nSteel.\n\nDonald Trump (08:34):\n\nSteel is saying the way it is. The steel and aluminum, et cetera, et cetera, that's a worldwide thing, that stays the way it is.\n\nUrsula von der Leyen (08:43):\n\nWe have-\n\nSpeaker 7 (08:43):\n\nHow about chips? Did you discuss that as part of the agreement? Chips?\n\nDonald Trump (08:48):\n\nChips is… Howard, you might want to describe the chips, please, if you would.\n\nHoward Lutnick (08:54):\n\nWell, the expectation is in two weeks time, we're going to come out with our chips 232, and that was one of the key reasons that the European Union came to talk to the President, to try to resolve all things at one time. And well, I'll let you wait for the two weeks until you get to announce your plan. But we are going to be bringing chip manufacturing back to the United States of America.\n\nDonald Trump (09:23):\n\nWe'll be doing a lot of chips. A lot of companies are coming in from Taiwan and from other places into the US, and they're doing that in order to avoid tariffs. The President really avoided the tariffs in a better way for them, much better way, much more conclusive, I think probably much more profitable, definitely much more profitable, and got a lot of benefit from it. It was a very interesting negotiation. I think it's going to be great for both parties.\n\nUrsula von der Leyen (09:59):\n\nYeah. Absolutely.\n\nDonald Trump (10:00):\n\nI think your various countries are very happy about this.\n\nSpeaker 4 (10:03):\n\nIs there an industry in the US that you see maybe having the first impact of getting into this market that was not accessible before, whether it's auto? What's the first call you made?\n\nDonald Trump (10:13):\n\nYeah, I think cars. Cars basically were not invited, were not, I don't know if the word is not allowed or you just kept them out somehow. But cars will be. We have some cars that do terrific business and we do really well with the pickup trucks, with the SUVs. We have some great things. And I think the people of Europe will have some diversification. I think that'll make them happy. So I think maybe cars would be the one that would go the biggest. And the second would be agriculture, the farmers. And we'll do it in very strict conjunction with the President and the European Union. And they're coming into, likewise, they're coming into our country with great vigor. And I think they're going to make a lot of money with this. I think everybody is. And again, it's going to bring a lot of unity and friendship. It's going to work out really well. Okay.\n\nSpeaker 5 (11:24):\n\nWhat's the next deal you're focused on now?\n\nDonald Trump (11:26):\n\nSay it.\n\nSpeaker 5 (11:26):\n\nWhat's the next deal you're focused on now?\n\nDonald Trump (11:30):\n\nThat's an interesting question. This was the big one. This is the biggest of them all. We're looking at deals with three or four other countries. But for the most part, I can't get them to understand that it's the letter. We just sent that letter and that letter is very universal for most. I mean most, you wouldn't be able to do this. You wouldn't have the time or the patience to be able to do a deal like this. Most of the others are going to be a certain tariff and we're going to keep it as low as we can, either generally smaller countries or countries we don't do much business with. But they've already received, to a large extent, they've received a letter. They'll probably receive a letter of clarification or a confirmation type letter, which will go out sometime during this week prior to August 1st. And the tariffs will start being paid by those countries prior to August, on August 1st and beyond. Okay.\n\nSpeaker 3 (12:30):\n\nMr. President, was part of the rush to get this deal done to knock the Jeffrey Epstein's story out [inaudible 00:12:36]?\n\nDonald Trump (12:35):\n\nOh, you got to be kidding with that. No, had nothing to do with it. Only you would think that.\n\nHoward Lutnick (12:42):\n\nOh my God.\n\nDonald Trump (12:42):\n\nThat had nothing to do with it.\n\nSpeaker 9 (12:43):\n\nOn the language it's good for European business and American business, businesses in this country, particularly small businesses are closing at record rates. And you'll speak to the Prime Minister tomorrow, Keir Starmer. What does he need to do to help British business in his country?\n\nDonald Trump (12:59):\n\nI think everybody's going to be happy with this. The Prime Minister of the UK, while he's not involved in this, will be very happy because there's a certain unity that's been brought there too. We have a separate deal with them, but I think everybody's going to, he's going to be very happy to know. Look, he's friendly with all of you. I think he's a very good man. And he's going to be very happy to see what we did. I think UK is going to be very, very happy. Thank you all very much. Appreciate it. Thank you. Thank you very much.\n\nSpeaker 10 (13:31):\n\nThank you, guys. Thanks. Thank you. Thank you, guys. That's it.\n\nSpeaker 11 (13:34):\n\n[inaudible 00:13:35] or spirits or airplanes?\n\nDonald Trump (13:38):\n\nEssentially not, not that we can think of. Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 10 (13:41):\n\nThanks, guys.",

How are you?\n\nDonald Trump (00:00):\n\nNice trade deal yesterday.\n\nSpeaker 2 (00:00):\n\nHow are you feeling about it?\n\nDonald Trump (00:00):\n\nGreat. Biggest one ever made.\n\nSpeaker 2 (00:00):\n\nWhat do you hope to accomplish today?\n\nKeir Starmer (00:00):\n\nPresident Trump.\n\nDonald Trump (00:00):\n\nHow are you? Nice to see you both.\n\nKeir Starmer (00:00):\n\nDoing well.\n\nDonald Trump (00:00):\n\nHi. Nice to see you both. [inaudible 00:02:11].\n\nKeir Starmer (00:00):\n\nHello.\n\nDonald Trump (00:00):\n\nHow are you? [inaudible 00:02:17] Nice to see you. [inaudible 00:02:23]\n\n(00:00)I just got done making a deal, another big tariff deal. [inaudible 00:02:27]\n\nVictoria Starmer (00:00):\n\nYeah.\n\nKeir Starmer (00:00):\n\n[inaudible 00:02:33].\n\nDonald Trump (00:00):\n\nThat's probably the hardest rock in the world.\n\nKeir Starmer (00:00):\n\nReally?\n\nDonald Trump (00:00):\n\n[Inaudible 00:03:00].\n\nKeir Starmer (00:00):\n\nThe third one?\n\nDonald Trump (00:00):\n\n[inaudible 00:03:07]. They go to the thing and take pictures. [inaudible 00:03:12]\n\nKeir Starmer (00:00):\n\nLike Congressmen.\n\nDonald Trump (00:00):\n\n[inaudible 00:03:27] It's massive.[inaudible 00:03:21]. For me, it's a long flight. It's very far away. [inaudible 00:03:34].\n\n(00:00)There's birds that fly around it in the middle. [inaudible 00:03:56] The birds fly. They just keep circling.\n\nVictoria Starmer (00:00):\n\nYeah. [inaudible 00:04:11].\n\nDonald Trump (00:00):\n\nForty-five minutes.\n\nKeir Starmer (00:00):\n\nJust to get through it? [inaudible 00:04:20].\n\n(00:00)That's fantastic. [inaudible 00:04:29].\n\nVictoria Starmer (00:00):\n\nYeah. Okay. [inaudible 00:05:19].\n\nDonald Trump (00:00):\n\nBeautiful. Beautiful country.\n\nVictoria Starmer (00:00):\n\nStunning. [inaudible 00:05:21]\n\nDonald Trump (00:00):\n\nThank you all very much. Do you have any questions?\n\nSpeaker 5 (00:00):\n\nMr. President.\n\nDonald Trump (00:00):\n\nExcuse me?\n\nSpeaker 5 (00:00):\n\nAre you going to come down and steal [inaudible 00:06:01] auto parts or anything?\n\nDonald Trump (06:02):\n\nWell, we're in great shape. The trade deal was made with UK. The Prime Minister did a great job. You know, they've been trying to make that deal for 12 years and he got it done. So everybody respects it. It's going to be a lot of jobs for here and great for America. And, you know, in terms of even the relationship, our relationship is unparalleled, but it keeps it even closer, you know, when you're able to have a good trade deal it keeps it even closer.\n\nSpeaker 6 (06:33):\n\n[inaudible 00:06:34] whiskey. The tariffs.\n\nDonald Trump (06:34):\n\nWhiskey? Well, we'll talk about that. I didn't know whiskey was a problem. I'm not a big whiskey drinker, but maybe I should be when I'm over here. [inaudible 00:06:41] Maybe I'll have some whiskey today. [inaudible 00:06:43].\n\nSpeaker 6 (06:42):\n\nIt's a 10% tariff [inaudible 00:06:45].\n\nDonald Trump (06:45):\n\nWell, we're going to take a look at it. [inaudible 00:06:46] We'll take a look. We want to make the Prime Minister happy. We want to make, by the way, your First Lady. I would say First Lady, she's a respected person all over the United States. I don't know what he's doing, but she's very respected, as respected as him. I don't want to say more. I'll get myself in trouble. But she's very, she's a great woman and very highly respected.\n\nSpeaker 2 (07:12):\n\nWhat do you have to say on Gaza today? [inaudible 00:07:15]\n\nDonald Trump (07:15):\n\nYeah, well we've, as you know, given a lot of money to Gaza for food and everything else. A lot of that money is stolen by Hamas and a lot of the food is stolen, but we're very much involved, and I think it's one of the main reasons for our meeting today.\n\nKeir Starmer (07:28):\n\nYeah, yeah. We're going to be discussing it today.\n\nDonald Trump (07:30):\n\nWe'll be talking about Gaza.\n\nSpeaker 2 (07:31):\n\nAnd get the ceasefire going again?\n\nDonald Trump (07:35):\n\nWell, we want to get it going, but as you know with Cambodia, they just announced a very big-\n\nKeir Starmer (07:42):\n\nYeah.\n\nDonald Trump (07:42):\n\nA very big-\n\nKeir Starmer (07:42):\n\nCeasefire this morning.\n\nDonald Trump (07:46):\n\nBeyond just peace. That was going to be a very bad war. And so we're honored we got involved and it's essentially settled. I think they're going to be settling it today. So it went for a few days. That was going to go on for years. That could have gone on for years. Millions of people could have been killed. We ended the war and we were very happy about it.\n\nSpeaker 7 (08:04):\n\nThe Prime Minister says that recognizing the Palestinian state will be a concrete step towards the lasting peace. Do you agree with his position?\n\nDonald Trump (08:11):\n\nWell, I'm not going to take a position. I don't mind him taking a position. I'm looking for getting people fed right now. Me, that's the number one position because you have a lot of starving people. You have people that, you know, the United States recently, just a couple of weeks ago, we gave $60 million. That's a lot of money. No other nation gave money. I know the Prime Minister would if you knew about it. And he really knows about it now because we're going to be discussing it. But we gave $60 million. Nobody said even thank you. You know, thanks. Somebody should say thank you, but other nations are going to have to step up. When I spoke to Ursula yesterday, she said that the European nations are going to step up very substantially too.\n\nSpeaker 8 (08:54):\n\nCan you discuss the importance of free speech today?\n\nDonald Trump (08:58):\n\nWell, free speech is very important. I don't know if you're referring to any place in particular. Perhaps they are, but-\n\nKeir Starmer (09:03):\n\nWe've had free speech for a very, very long time here. So we're very proud of about that. We protect it.\n\nSpeaker 7 (09:08):\n\nWhat's your advice on the small boats crisis this country? How would you deal with it? What's your advice on dealing with the small boats crisis in this country?\n\nDonald Trump (09:13):\n\nWhat did he say?\n\nSpeaker 7 (09:13):\n\nThe small boat crisis.\n\nKeir Starmer (09:15):\n\nIt's about the boats coming over the channel. So we're taking a lot of action to stop people coming over the channel who shouldn't be here. Stopping them coming in the first place. [inaudible 00:09:24]\n\nDonald Trump (09:24):\n\nWell, immigration is a big factor. And I think, frankly, if they're coming from other countries and you don't know who they are and are they coming from prisons? We have them where they came in from prisons. We're moving them all out. We had a border last June, just recent, you know last month. We had zero people come into the country, zero other than coming through legal means. If you're stopping immigration and stopping the wrong people, my hats are off to you. You're doing, not a good thing, you're doing a fantastic thing. So I know nothing about the boats, but if the boats are loaded up with bad people, and they usually are because you know other countries don't send their best. They send people that they don't want. And they're not stupid people. And they send the people that they don't want. And I've heard that you've taken a much stronger stance on your immigration?\n\nKeir Starmer (10:15):\n\nYeah, we've done a lot of work stopping them coming. We just signed an agreement to return them. And we've returned 35,000, in fact in the first year of this Labour government, of people who shouldn't be in this country. So, we're very pleased that we're getting on with returning people who've got no right to be here.\n\nDonald Trump (10:30):\n\nThat's great. As somebody that loves this, I love this country. My mother was born in, as you know, my mother was born in Scotland, and it's an incredible place, a beautiful place. And if that be the case, I congratulate you. That's exactly, because you know Europe is a much different place than it was just five years ago, 10 years ago. And they've got to get their act together. If they don't, you're not going to have Europe anymore as you know it. And you can't do that. T.\n\n(10:56)His is a magnificent part of the world and you cannot ruin it. You cannot let people come in here illegally. And what happens is they'll be murderers, there'll be drug dealers, there'll be all sorts of things that other countries don't want. And they send them to you and they send them to us. And you've got to stop them. And I hear that you've taken a very strong stand on immigration.\n\nKeir Starmer (11:16):\n\nYeah. Yeah.\n\nDonald Trump (11:17):\n\nAnd taking a strong stand on immigration is imperative.\n\nSpeaker 2 (11:25):\n\nMr. President, Prime Minister Netanyahu said that there's no starvation in Gaza. Do you agree with that assessment?\n\nDonald Trump (11:27):\n\nI don't know. I mean, based on television, I would say not particularly because those children look very hungry. But we're giving a lot of money and a lot of food, and other nations are now stepping up. I know that this nation is, right here.\n\nKeir Starmer (11:38):\n\nIt's a humanitarian crisis.\n\nDonald Trump (11:39):\n\nRight.\n\nKeir Starmer (11:40):\n\nIt's an absolute catastrophe. And nobody wants to see that. And I think people in Britain are revolted at seeing what they're seeing on their screens. So we've got to get to that cease fire, and thank you Mr. President for leading on that. And also to just get more and more aid in. And again, America's done a lot on this. A lot of countries have done a lot. We are now working with Jordan on getting direct aid drops in. But this is a desperate situation.\n\nSpeaker 9 (12:05):\n\nMr. President, do think Israel has done all it can do to avoid serious casualties in Gaza?\n\nDonald Trump (12:10):\n\nWell, I think nobody's done anything great over there. The whole place is a mess. It'll get straightened out, but it's a mess. They have to get food and maintain, food and safety right now. And ultimately, look, Hamas did a horrible thing and they paid a big price, but Hamas did a horrible thing. But I always said, when you get down to the last 20 or 10, they're down to 20. We got a lot of hostages out and you helped us by the way.\n\nKeir Starmer (12:38):\n\nYeah. Yeah.\n\nDonald Trump (12:38):\n\nBut we got a lot of hostages out over the last six months that I've been in. I've been in office for six months now, and these hostages have been, I mean many of them have come to the Oval Office and they've thanked me so profusely. I said, you don't have to thank me. I did what I have to do. But I always said, when you get down to the final 20, they won't release them because that's like their shield. Very unfair. And so something's going to have to be done. And they were really unwilling to talk, but I've said that. You'll get down to the final 10 or 20. It turns out to be 20. I thought that would be the number. I said they're not going to be dealing with us. And you know, many of the hostages are now dead, you know that.\n\n(13:18)And parents come up to me. A woman came up to me two weeks ago. She just wants her son back. And I said, how's he doing? My son's dead, sir, but he's with them and we want the body. She wanted the body of this young boy, of her young, beautiful son just as much as if he were alive.\n\nKeir Starmer (13:36):\n\nThat's tragic.\n\nDonald Trump (13:36):\n\nIt was just as important. There was no difference. And it's a tragic situation, frankly. But we get a lot out. And now possibly the fight will have to be a little bit different, but they have totally changed now. They don't want to give hostages. Very unfair. You have 20 living people, in this case living. You have many dead people too, that they want to get.\n\nKeir Starmer (14:02):\n\nBeen a hell of a long time as well.\n\nDonald Trump (14:03):\n\nYeah. They have 20 living people. And I told Israel, I told Bibi that you're going to have to now maybe do it a different way.\n\nSpeaker 9 (14:13):\n\nDo you think a ceasefire is even possible, Mr. President?\n\nDonald Trump (14:16):\n\nYeah, a ceasefire is possible, but you have to get it… You have to end it. You're talking about with Israel, you're talking about there, because we have many ceasefires going on. The whole world is… If I weren't around, you'd have right now six major wars going on. India would be fighting with Pakistan. You see what we just did yesterday with two nations that we're trading with. And during the trade, I said I'm not going to do any trade deal unless you guys settle your differences. And we got it settled in 24 hours. I mean, they just announced it was settled, which was a tremendous thing. But Serbia, Kosovo is another one. We have many hotspots that were at war.\n\n(14:57)I think a very big one was Indian and Pakistan, because you're talking about two nuclear nations. That was a very big one. But we get help from the UK. The Prime Minister has helped. We have cases where we specifically need the help because somebody comes from here that you're aware of, and you know when you come from a country you can do things. And I call up the Prime Minister and all of a sudden he's able to do things. True also with other presidents and prime ministers. But we've done it. Nobody's ever done what we've done. We have six different major-\n\n(15:31)Look, If you take a look at Rwanda and the Congo, Republic of the Congo, they've been fighting for 31 years, 8 million people dead. It was going on. Nobody could go to that part of Africa. They were being killed. To even walk there, you're being killed with machetes. And it was a violent situation. And I was able to. They liked Trump. They wanted to make a trade deal with Trump. They wanted us to take their rare earth. They want to give us their rare earth.\n\n(16:02)And I got to know the leader of the Congo. I got to know both of them indirectly. And I called him and I said let's end the war. I don't want anything until you end the war. And we ended the war. As you know, the foreign ministers came up two weeks ago, and the leaders are going to be coming very shortly to Washington. Rwanda and Congo. That's another one that we did. So we've done a lot. It's an honor to do it. It's not hard for me to do it. And I use, not in all cases, but I use a combination of knowing them a little bit, or in some cases, knowing them a lot. I knew the leaders of Pakistan and India. I know them very well. And you know, they're in the midst of a trade deal, and yet they're talking about nuclear weapons.\n\n(16:46)I say this is crazy. So I said I'm not doing a trade deal with you guys, and they want the trade deal. They need it. I'm not doing a trade deal with you if you're going to have war. And that's a war that spreads to other countries. You'll get nuclear dust. We'll all get nuclear dust. When they start using nuclear weapons, that stuff blows all over the place and really bad things happen. So maybe we're being a little selfish, what we want to save wars too. But we stopped a lot of wars and it's a great honor to have done it. [inaudible 00:17:15].\n\n(17:14)Thank you all very much. We're going to be talking inside about, very much about Gaza and the humanitarian aspects of Gaza, I think. Right?\n\nKeir Starmer (17:22):\n\nYeah.\n\nSpeaker 2 (17:22):\n\nMr. President, what about Russia and Ukraine? You're talking about ceasefire. What's the latest?\n\nDonald Trump (17:26):\n\nI would've said five times we would've had a deal. I've spoken to President Putin a lot. I always got along with him very well. But five times, and every time, four times maybe. But we've had discussions. You and I have had discussions.\n\nKeir Starmer (17:42):\n\nYeah.\n\nDonald Trump (17:43):\n\nWe thought we had that settled numerous times. And then President Putin goes out and starts launching rockets into some city like Kiev and kills a lot of people in a nursing home or whatever. You have bodies lying all over the street. And I say, that's not the way to do it. So we'll see what happens with that. I'm very disappointed. I'm disappointed in President Putin. Very disappointed in him. So we're going to have to look, and I'm going to reduce that 50 days that I gave him to a lesser number because I think I already know the answer, what's going to happen. Okay? Thank you very much everybody. We'll see you later.",

    "transcript": "Donald Trump (00:00):\n\n… about as good as it comes, up here, the brain power, the greatest power of them all, the brain power. Well, I'm thrilled to be here with so many tech leaders and luminaries as we take historic action to reassert the future, which belongs to America, always has belonged to America. We just lost sight of it on occasion. And I just want to start by stating that we've just concluded our big trade deal with Japan and numerous other countries in addition, as you know. But on the Japan deal, because it was literally just signed letter, was just signed, it gives us a sort of signing bonus. So I'll bring it into sports talk, a signing bonus, like you have signing bonuses too, I understand. Get a lot of money. 100 million, that's not bad. But that's not as good as the signing bonus we got. We got a $550 billion signing bonus for the country.\n\n(01:04)And we had the tariff at 25%. As you know, we had a tariff at 25% and these are great people that we negotiated with, but we agreed to reduce it to 15 based on the fact that Japan has agreed for the first time ever to open up its country to trade so that all of our American businesses and business geniuses, including many in this room, can go out and do business openly and freely in Japan, a very rich and prosperous and profitable and wonderful country frankly. And we will pay a zero tariff as we do business in Japan. So we're paying zero, they're paying 15, we're getting $550 billion. And to be exact, it's 90% of that, but we control the whole lot of it and it's really been great. And they're very happy, and their stock market went up and our stock market went up, and that's supposed to be the way as ours went way up and theirs went up, and we've made numerous other deals like that.\n\n(02:18)But the opening up of a country is very important to us. We have numerous countries that have opened their doors, just made some incredible transactions, but we're going to have a very, very simple tariff for some of the countries, have so many countries, you can't negotiate deals with everyone. So we'll have a straight, simple tariff of anywhere between 15 and 50%. A couple, we have 15 because we haven't been getting along with those countries too well. So we just say, \"Let's pay 50 and that's the way it is.\" But remember, we get countries that were closed, always closed, every one in this room would never remember any of them to be open. We've offered such a deal to the European Union where we're in serious negotiations and if they agree to open up the union to American businesses, then we will let them pay a lower tariff.\n\n(03:16)So the tariff is very important, but the opening of a country I think can be more important if our businesses do the job that they're supposed to be doing. Such openings are worthy of many points in tariffs and they're a good thing, not only for as an example Japan or Europe, but certainly a great thing for America because it allows our businesses to go out and fairly compete and do really well if they compete properly like the people that I know. Every one in this room practically I know has competed very successfully. I haven't seen any and I know the losers just like I know the winners, I'll tell you. I don't see any of the losers here.\n\n(03:59)But now, if some of the countries that pay 25% or more on orders complain, remember that Japan was willing to pay upfront the $550 billion for that privilege of negotiating with the United States of America. We also made a deal yesterday with the Philippines and Indonesia, which in both cases will be opening up their country and we're in the process of completing our deal with China. And as you know, the UK, we made a deal, a very good deal for everybody. Everybody's happy. It's always nice when everybody can be happy. But mostly, we'll be charging straight tariffs to most of the rest of the world because we have over 200 countries. People don't realize, that's a lot of deals. Even if you're like me, a deal junkie, that's a lot of deals. That would be too much for anybody. How did we do with this country that I never heard of? We got a lot of deals cooking.\n\n(05:06)But America is taking in hundreds of billions of dollars like it never has before. Investments into our country at the highest point ever in history, and we've just really been opened up for business for three of the six months. The first couple of months, we got ourselves all set, done a great job with our military as you know. You saw that two weeks ago when you saw the way those incredible B2s flew into Iran and took out an entire nuclear potential deadly force. But I want to thank some of the incredible people that I see before me, including White House AI Czar, David Sacks. He's been great for organizing this very important summit and especially for putting it in DC where it's a little bit easier. I don't know if it's easy for you, but it's a hell of a lot easier for me.\n\n(06:12)Along with his colleagues at the All-In Podcast, which is very good. I did that podcast a year and a half ago and I said, \"This is something,\" it was pretty new, pretty raw. Everybody I knew saw that podcast. I said, \"Well, he's got something pretty good. Who is that guy?\" He is a smart guy, by the way. I think if I ever get in, which at the time people were saying I had a shot, not as good a shot. As it turned out, we won numbers that nobody believes. We won every swing state. We won by millions and millions of votes winning the popular vote. We won with the districts as they would call them, 2,750 to 505, and that's why the map is almost completely red except for a couple of little blue areas on each side of it.\n\n(07:00)But it was a great experience, frankly for me, and hopefully it's a great experience and been a great experience for our country, because they're saying we had the greatest six months that a president has ever had the opening six months, and I'm not even sure, maybe six months. I'm not sure it's the opening, but let's call it the opening six months. It sounds a little bit nicer.\n\n(07:20)I want to also say hello and thank to Chamath and his wonderful wife, Nat, thank you very much for being here. Thank you very much. It was great seeing you again. Great couple. David Friedberg, and even as we know Jason Calacanis, I say even. Thank you, Jason. Thank you, Jason, I appreciate that. That is a good person. Thanks as well to The Hill and Valley Forum and our future undersecretary of state Jacob Helberg. Stand up, Jacob. I met him a year and a half ago and I was very impressed. I said, \"Let's bring him in.\"\n\n(08:11)We bring in a lot of smart people and David's been unbelievable as the job he's doing. Along with secretaries, Doug Burgum, who's been incredible. Doug, thank you. Thank you, Doug. Great job. He's producing low-cost energy. We're down to $64. I want to get it down a little bit further if we can. I don't know if the oil companies love that or not, but we want to have very inexpensive electricity so that you can power up the plants because you need more electricity than any human beings ever in the history of the world.\n\n(08:49)When I heard what you really need, I said, \"You got to be kidding.\" Double what we produce right now for everything, right? I don't know, Jensen, you're going to have to explain that to me someday, why they need so damn much. Could you do with a little bit less? My father always used to say, \"Turn off the lights, son.\" But you guys are turning up the lights. I want to thank Howard Lutnick for doing a terrific job. He was involved in the big deal that we just completed with Japan. Howard, wherever you are, Howard. Where is Howard? Hi, Howard. Great job you did. Appreciate it, really. That was an interesting negotiation. These are tough people. These are good negotiators, I will tell you, Japan. But they love their country and they do what's right for their country.\n\n(09:37)I want to thank Chris Wright, if Chris is around, Chris is here because he's helping with the tremendous energy success that we're having. We're having tremendous energy success. We're the biggest. We have more energy than anybody else in the world. Nobody knew that until I came along. But we have more energy than anybody else in the world. We're making incredible deals on energy, including deals in Alaska while we sort of, that's the mother lode, that's the big one. And we're making deals with various Asian countries that need it. And it's actually hard to believe, you don't think of it, but Asia is very close to Alaska, relatively speaking. It's not the closest, but it is pretty much the closest when it comes to oil and gas and energy. And we're making some incredible deals.\n\n(10:24)And I want to thank Chris. Chris is fantastic. Works in partnership really with this gentleman who's the head of all of, you've got the land and he's got the energy, but they formed a great partnership, Doug, so that's one of the greatest partnerships I've seen in a long time. They work hand-in-hand and they have done a great job. Administrators, Kelly Loeffler I think is here. Kelly, thank you very much. Hi, Kelly. Hi, Kelly. And probably the most important man in the room, and I say it in all sincerity, more important than Doug and Chris and all that energy they're producing. He's a man that produces fast permits on the environmental impact statements. He gets them done. I said, \"Lee, you have one week, one week for nuclear and you have a couple of days for oil and gas for the approvals.\"\n\n(11:22)And we kid, but he really is, he's knocked them out fast. He's knocked out a lot. A lot of guys have started your plans already and you've already had your approvals. So where's Lee Zeldin? Is he here? He is so great. This guy. He is so great. That's why he has a slightly better seat than I gave to Doug. You see? No, he's doing a fantastic job in a lot of ways, but he's doing a great job and he's getting fast permits and safe and good and everything else, but he's moving them along rapidly, already given some.\n\n(11:53)And one of the most exciting things we'll talk about in a second is the fact that you're going to build your own electric producing plants when you build whatever you're building. And it could be it's different things, including automobile factories, which are going up all over the place. You'll see them starting soon where they're moving into our country because of the tariffs, because they don't want to pay the tariffs. They're moving into our country at a record speed. But the ability to build your own electric plant, not having to rely on a 100-year plus old grid. And then, if you have electric capacity extra, you're going to sell it into the grid, make some money, but you'll sell it right back into the grid. Director of the Office of Science and Technology Policy, Michael Kratsios. Michael, thank you very much. Thank you, Michael.\n\n(12:47)As well, who is supposed to be taking a vote right now, big vote, Senator Ted Cruz. Is Senator Cruz here? Oh, look at my senator. Why aren't you voting? I think we lost David McCormick who's voting. Is David here? Because you're supposed to be voting, Ted. I don't know. I'll tell you what, this man works hard. Ted works hard and he works good. And a very special thanks to some of the top industry leaders here, including somebody that's amazing. I said, \"Look, we'll break this guy up.\" This before I learned the facts of life. I said, \"We'll break him up.\" They said, \"No, sir. He is very hard.\" I said, \"Why?\" I said, \"What percentages of the market does he have?\" They said, \" He has 100%.\" I said, \"Who the hell is he? What's his name?\" \"His name is Jensen Huang, NVIDIA.\"\n\n(13:39)I said, \"What the hell is NVIDIA? I've never heard of it before.\" He said, \"You don't want to know about it, sir.\" I figured we could go in and we could sort of break him up a little bit, get him a little competition, and I found out it's not easy on that business. I said, \"Supposedly we put the greatest minds together. They work hand-in-hand for a couple of years.\" He said, \"No, it would take at least 10 years to catch him if he ran NVIDIA totally incompetently from now on.\" So I said, \"All right, let's go on to the next one.\" And then, I got to know Jensen, and now I see why Jensen, we used to end up, what a job. What a job you've done. Great. He's a great guy too.\n\n(14:26)Lisa Su of AMD. Lisa. Lisa, thank you. Congratulations. Great job. Shyam Sankar of Palantir. We buy a lot of things from Palantir. Where are you? Are we paying our bills? I think so. We just made a deal with the European Union where they're going to pay the United States of America 100% of the cost of all military equipment. They're going to ship it to the European\n\nDonald Trump (15:00):\n\n… Union and then they'll distribute it. And much of it will go to Ukraine. It's been a long time since you've heard those words because we're in for $350 billion, but now we send it to Europe and Europe pays. And they were great. We had a tremendous NATO meeting a few weeks ago. And it was pretty amazing actually what happened. They've agreed to go from 2% to 5%. And they had 2% where they didn't pay. They have 5% where they've already paid. That's a big difference. That's trillions of dollars, actually. Trillions. But they're going to spend that money in the United States with our defense companies. And we're going to send it to them, and they'll distribute the equipment that we send. So that's the way it should have been three years ago, frankly. And Jeff Sprecher, the other half of that incredible family, is he here? Is he here?\n\n(15:55)He's a fantastic guy. International Intercontinental Exchange. And he's been a friend of mine for a long time. The husband of Kelly, who's really doing a good job. You are really doing a good job. Small business, which is actually big business if you add it all up, right? Probably the biggest bank there is, but they call it small business. And she's done a fantastic job. Thanks, Kel. Say hello to Jeff. As we gather this afternoon, we're still in the earliest days of one of the most important technological revolutions in the history of the world. Around the globe, everyone is talking about artificial intelligence. I find that too artificial. I can't stand it. I don't even like the name. I don't like anything that's artificial. So could we straighten that out, please? We should change the name. I actually mean that. I don't like the name artificial anything because it's not artificial.\n\n(16:46)It's genius. It's pure genius. And it's potential to transform every type of human endeavor and domain of human knowledge from medicine to manufacturing to warfare and national defense. Whether we like it or not, we're suddenly engaged in a fast-paced competition to build and define this groundbreaking technology that will determine so much about the future of civilization itself because of the genius and creativity of Silicon Valley. And it is incredible. Incredible genius. Without question, the most brilliant place anywhere on earth. America is the country that started the AI race. And as President of the United States, I'm here today to declare that America is going to win it. We're going to work hard, we're going to win it because we will not allow any foreign nation to beat us. Our children will not live in a planet controlled by the algorithms, the adversaries advancing values and interests contrary to our own. We don't want to have contrary interests. We want to get along. And we'll get along with other countries. We're having a great relationship, as I told you, with those countries that we mentioned, with Japan and Indonesia and so many others. The European Union, we're getting along. We're getting along very well with China. Have a lot of respect for President Xi. We have a great relationship. And we'll see how it all works out. But we're getting along with countries very … It's really been pretty amazing. I will say that. And it's a good thing. It's a good thing, not a bad thing. So from this day forward, it'll be a policy of the United States to do whatever it takes to lead the world in artificial intelligence. Such an important thing happening. This is really something that nobody expected. It just popped out of the air, and here we are. But we will defend our nation, our values, our future, and our freedom. And it will be really great.\n\n(18:59)But what we really need to be successful is a very simple phrase called common sense. And that begins with a common sense application of artificial and intellectual property rules. It's so important. You can't be expected to have a successful AI program when every single article, book, or anything else that you've read or studied, you're supposed to pay for. \"Gee, I read a book. I'm supposed to pay somebody.\" And we appreciate that, but you just can't do it because it's not doable. And if you're going to try and do that, you're not going to have a successful program. I think most of the people in the room know what I mean. When a person reads a book or an article, you've gained great knowledge. That does not mean that you're violating copyright laws or have to make deals with every content provider. And that's a big thing that you're working on right now.\n\n(19:53)I know. But you just can't do it. China's not doing it. And if you're going to be beating China … And right now, we're leading China very substantially in AI. Very, very substantially. And nobody's seen the amount of work that's going to be bursting upon the scene. But you have to be able to play by the same set of rules. So when you have something, when you read something, and when it goes into this vast intelligence machine, we'll call it, you cannot expect to every time, every single time say, \"Oh, let's pay this one that much. Let's pay this one.\" Just doesn't work that way. Of course, you can't copy or plagiarize an article, but if you read an article and learn from it, we have to allow AI to use that pool of knowledge without going through the complexity of contract negotiations, of which there would be thousands for every time we use AI. We also have to have a single federal standard, not 50 different states regulating this industry of the future.\n\n(20:56)And some people would say, \"Gee, that's an unpopular thing to say.\" I was told before I got up here this is an unpopular thing because some people, they don't want that, but I want you to be successful and you can't have one state holding you up. You can't have three or four states holding you up. You can't have a state with standards that are so high that it's going to hold you up. You have to have a federal rule and regulation. Hopefully you'll have the right guy in this position that's going to supplant the states. If you are operating under 50 different sets of state laws, the most restrictive state of all will be the one that rules. So you could have a state run by a crazy governor, a governor that hates you, a governor that's not smart, or maybe a governor that's very smart, but decides that he doesn't like the industry and he can put you out of business because you're going to have to go to that lowest common denominator.\n\n(21:57)We need one common sense federal standard that supersedes all states, supersedes everybody, so you don't end up in litigation with 43 states at one time. You got to go litigation-free. It's the only way. And we also have to watch Europe, Asia, and all foreign countries so that they don't make rules and regulations that, likewise, make it impossible for you to do business. And where you'd have to make everything in AI cater to them because, again, you'd have to cater to the toughest country or to the toughest state. You can't do that because it would ruin it. I just terminated all of the, as an example, California car emissions rules, which were a disaster. A disaster. It cost them just billions of dollars as an industry, but thousands of dollars per car. The emission rule standard. Because they were making the production of an automobile almost impossible and at a tremendously higher cost, much more expensive than it should cost for very little gain, for actually, in my opinion, negative gain.\n\n(23:04)The automobile was worse. Under this administration, our innovation will be unmatched and our capabilities will be unrivaled. And with the help of many of the people in this room, America's ultimate triumph will be absolutely unstoppable. We will be unstoppable as a nation. Again, we're way ahead and we want to stay that way. We can't let individual smaller units stop it because that's the only thing that can stop it and can really mess it up. As with any such breakthrough, this technology brings the potential for bad as well as for good, for peril as well as for progress. But the daunting power of AI is the … Really, it's not going to be a reason for retreat from this new frontier. On the contrary, it is the more reason we must ensure it is pioneered first and best. We have to have the best, the first … We are the best and the first pioneers. And we're going to be really putting a nation that we love, America, we're going to be putting it first.\n\n(24:11)I have an expression, America first. Make America great again. A lot of great expressions, but they're all so true. Make America great again. We're going to make this industry absolutely the top because right now, it's a beautiful baby that's born. We have to grow that baby and let that baby thrive. We can't stop it. We can't stop it with politics. We can't stop it with foolish rules and even stupid rules. At the same time, we want to have rules, but they have to be smart. They have to be brilliant. They have to be more brilliant than even the technology itself. Surely, there will be challenges on the path ahead, but together, we'll meet them and transcend them all. We are Americans and we are Americans first. A couple of people I know that don't happen to be from here, but I wish you a lot of luck anyway.\n\n(25:03)I was looking at three people that are not Americans, but they're very good people. Please treat them nicely. But we do not shrink from the future or cower at the face of uncertainty. We dominate the future. We conquer new frontiers. And we control our own fate. And we determine, by doing that, our own destiny. Winning this competition will be a test of our capacities, unlike anything since the dawn of the space age. Believe that. It's hard to believe, as the President, the amount of enthusiasm for this one industry. I can talk about cars where we're doing incredibly well. We have car companies moving in all the time, but I talk about other industries. Everybody's saying this is going to dominate the world, going to dominate every industry that ever conceived. I don't know if that's true. I don't know if it's true, but I can tell you that a lot of very brilliant people think it is true.\n\n(26:01)It'll dominate everything. It will challenge us to marshal all of our strength and flex the muscles of American ingenuity and resolve like probably never before. It will require us to blast through obsolete systems, cut through thickets of regulation. We've got to get rid of some of the regulation, but we want good regulation. And we build the industrial bedrock of our country. And perhaps most importantly, winning the AI race will demand a new spirit of patriotism and national loyalty in Silicon Valley and long beyond Silicon Valley.\n\n(26:45)For too long, much of our tech industry pursued a radical globalism that left millions of Americans feeling distrustful and betrayed. And you know that. Everybody knows that. Everybody in this room certainly does. Many of our largest tech companies have reaped the blessings of American freedom, while building their factories in China, hiring workers in India, and slashing profits in Ireland.\n\n(27:11)You know that. All the while dismissing and even censoring their fellow citizens right here at home. Under President Trump, those days are over. We need US technology companies to be all in for America. We want you to put America first. You have to do that. That's all we ask. That's all we ask. To partner with our tech geniuses and achieve in this vision, today we're releasing the White House AI Action Plan. Big stuff. Signing it right after this. In fact, I see it sitting right there. Maybe I should just sign it right now. Who the hell has to make the rest of this speech? Right? But here are the pillars of the strategy. First, my administration will use every tool at our disposal to ensure that the United States can build and maintain the largest, most powerful, and most advanced AI infrastructure anywhere on the planet.\n\n(28:09)America needs new data centers, new semiconductor and chip manufacturing facilities, new power plants and transmission lines. And under my leadership, we're going to get that job done. And it's going to be done with certainty and with environmental protection and all of the things that we have to do to get it done properly. Virtually all of these large capital investments can be and should be made by the private sector. And they want to do that. They just want to be able to do it. But for that reason, America must once again be a country where innovators are rewarded with a green light, not strangled with red tape so they can't move, so they can't breathe. And that's not going to happen. You're going to see things that you've never seen in this country before so often. And I've been watching for many years. I've watched regulation.\n\n(28:57)I've been a victim of regulation. A zone change. It takes six years for a building in Manhattan or whatever. But I was good at zone changes, but it took a long time. By the time you got the zoning, the market changed. You didn't want to build the building. You say, \"Well.\" But in some cases, that made you lucky, didn't it? And some could not. Too many people understand that in this room. But in some cases, waiting for that approval as the market collapsed was a good thing, not a bad thing. But it's time to reclaim our heritage as a nation of builders. And that's why upon taking office, I signed a historic executive order directing that every one, and this is so important, for every new regulation, 10 old regulations must be immediately eliminated. So we have old regulations that clog up the books that don't even mean anything anymore. In my first term, I had more regulation cuts than any president in history times four. And that included two\n\nDonald Trump (30:00):\n\n… term presidents, where you're talking about eight years. We had more than any other president, and I think we may even top it this year. We may very well be able to top it during this period of time because you really, you are a regulation-prone group and we're looking to get those regulations out of your way so you can use your genius.\n\n(30:20)Earlier this month, we also enacted the largest tax cuts in American history when I signed the One Big Beautiful Bill into law. And I think the most important thing in the whole tax cut in terms of pure economics, and I think one of the reasons that my first… We had the most successful economy in history during my first term, and I think this is going to blow it away. So far it is, and I think this is going to blow it away, but the reason we had was I had expensing at 100%. And what we did is we included 100% in this bill expensing for all capital expenditures, including investments in factories and equipment and structure. Structure wasn't included last time.\n\n(31:09)So even structure and you're able to write it all off immediately. That's the biggest thing. Not 38 years, not 42 years, you're able to write it all off immediately. And this time we've made it for 10 years, not for one year. We've made it for 10 years, so you have a much longer period. But I'd say get out and take advantage of it. I think that's one of the reasons that we had such an incredible success with the first tax cuts. And one of the things that this bill does is it extends the first tax cuts and makes them permanent. And in addition to that, we were granted other taxes like no tax on tips, no tax on social security, no tax on overtime, a lot of great things.\n\n(31:53)One of the things that I mentioned, not so pertinent here, but if you're in the automobile business, it's pertinent. I said, \"Why is it that people like us always are looking for expenses and deductions?\" And people that buy automobiles that really have to go out and borrow money to buy a car, why aren't they allowed to deduct the interest on their loan to buy a car from their income tax? And we got it approved. We got it approved. And that is such a big thing and I think that's going to be such a big thing for the automobile industry. And we're going to be making more cars, within a few years. We're going to be making more cars than we made in the very beginning, in the super prime.\n\n(32:32)We lost almost 50% of our automobile business to Mexico, Canada, and various other places, as you know, in Europe and in Asia, and now we're getting it back. We're getting it back in record numbers that I think we're going to be topping any amount. In a few years we'll be making more automobiles than we've ever made in the history of our country, including what I call prime time.\n\n(32:55)My administration is also pursuing a future of all-out American energy dominance. And on day one I terminated the Green New Scam. You know what that was? You were all victims to it. Perhaps the second or third-greatest scam in the history of our country. I would say the first was Russia, Russia, Russia. And we had a couple of others too, but the ?Green New Scam was one of the greatest. It's so ridiculous what they've made you do. The carbon footprint, they talked about the carbon footprint, and then Obama hops onto a 747 Air Force One, and flies to Hawaii to play a round of golf and comes back. What about the carbon footprint? No, we didn't like that.\n\n(33:39)And what Biden has done is absolutely terrible. He made it impossible, almost impossible for people to do business. Not even talking about the border where millions and millions of people float into our country, many from prisons, from jails, from gangs, from mental institutions all over the world. No, we're not doing that. We have to get them out. We've got 11,888 murderers. Many of them committed more than one murder, many of them, more than 50% committed more murders. We're getting them out of our country, or in some cases, they're so bad we're not getting them out. We're having to lock them up because we don't want them ever to come back, no matter how good we're doing. Last month you probably read, we had zero people enter our country illegally. And over the last number of years you'd have hundreds of thousands, literally hundreds of thousands of people a week pour into our country, totally unvetted and unchecked, and what the hell were they thinking? What they've done to our country is so sad and we can never forget it.\n\n(34:46)But we are unleashing all forms of energy, including natural gas, oil and clean, beautiful coal. I instructed my people, in the form of Chris and Doug in particular, you are not allowed to say the word coal without saying clean, beautiful in front of it. You can only say clean, beautiful coal. It's a little embarrassing. We had somebody making a speech the other day, right? And he mentioned the word coal about 30 times because that was the subject, and he kept going clean, beautiful. I wanted to say, okay, just take it easy. You could just… It got a little bit crazy, right, Doug?\n\n(35:19)But China's using it. They're building now 57 big power plants all fueled by coal and we have to compete, we'll have to win, and we're going to have clean, beautiful coal. But we have more coal than any… We have more anything in terms of energy than anybody, oil and gas. We also have more coal. In May, I also signed an executive order to rapidly begin construction of safe, reliable nuclear reactors. That's a big thing now, and many of you are going to be using nuclear. I had problems with nuclear, saw some of the things, but what they've done with nuclear is like what you've done with AI and other things. It's incredible actually. It's long term. It's inexpensive. It's safe. What they've done is really amazing.\n\n(36:13)So we opened up the industry, very strict rules, but we opened up the industry and some of you're going to choose nuclear over oil and gas or whatever it might be. Under the last year of Biden, China added 11 times as much power generation capacity as did the United States. Can you imagine that, 11 times? Under the Trump administration, we will be saying those very famous campaign words, drill, baby drill and build, baby build. And we will be adding at least as much electric capacity as China. We think we're going to catch them and maybe even have something a little bit extra.\n\n(36:51)They go at it very rapidly but so are we. And we'll be doing at least as much, and every company will be given the right to build their own power plant. So when you build, you can build your power plant with it and you are essentially going to become your own utility. It's a utility to yourselves. And as I said, any excess energy, you're going to sell back to the grid and make plenty of money doing it.\n\n(37:14)As a result of these pro-American policies, since my election, we're seeing trillions and trillions of dollars in new investments. So at this moment we have almost $17 trillion coming into this country. There's never been a period of time like that, and that's in a period of a few months. In a few months, Meta, Amazon, Google, Microsoft are all investing $320 billion or more in data centers and AI infrastructure this year. Those companies are really, they're really going at it. And they're very smart people, very good people. I got to know a lot of them.\n\n(37:53)I didn't like them so much first term when I was running. I wouldn't say I was thrilled with them, but I've gotten to know them and like them, and I think they got to like me, but I think they got to like my policies maybe much more than me. Nvidia has committed $500 billion over the next four years. Thank you, Jensen. I'm sure that'll be a good investment. If you're doing it, it's good. Thank you very much. It's a great statement.\n\n(38:20)Last week I was in Pennsylvania as 20 companies announced $92 billion with David McCormick, senator, a great guy from Pennsylvania. $92 billion in energy and data center projects, including what will soon be the largest natural gas power plant anywhere in North America. They're going to town. It's already under construction, the largest in North America by far.\n\n(38:43)For decades, we had leaders who spent their time focused on building up foreign nations. Under the Trump administration, we are going to have leaders who are going to build up our nation. This colossal investment in AI infrastructure, and many other industries for that matter, such as automobiles and so many other things, will also create thousands and thousands of great paying jobs. The kind of jobs we want, including lots of blue collar jobs. And our numbers are very good right now, but when you see these numbers in two years from now, it will mean higher wages and more opportunity for millions of energy workers, HVAC technicians, engineers, electricians, and the hardworking citizens who make our country run. These are great people that make our country actually run.\n\n(39:33)To ensure America maintains the world-class infrastructure, we need to win. Today I will sign a sweeping executive order to fast track federal permitting, streamline reviews, and do everything possible to expedite construction of all major AI infrastructure projects. And this will be done. You will get so good a service in so many ways, not only from Lee with the environment, but you need many other types of permits and you're going to go so fast. You're going to say, \"Well, wait a minute, this is too fast. I didn't expect to go this quickly. This is a problem. I may cause a problem in opposite…\"\n\n(40:08)But including factories, data centers and power plants of all kinds, the United States will have total industrial and technological supremacy. The second pillar of our action plan for AI dominance is to get the entire world running on the backbone of American technology. And I think that's very much happening right now and I think it's going to happen. The last administration was obsessed with imposing restrictions on AI, including extreme restrictions on its exports. As you know, they made it very difficult to export. This alienated American partners and drove even our friends into the arms of China and other countries.\n\n(40:48)That's why upon taking office, I repealed the so-called Biden Diffusion rule, can you imagine, that that crippled American AI exports. The Biden Diffusion rule, I wonder who came up with that name because he has no idea what it is. He had no idea what it was. He came up with a rule. I wonder who drew that one. I wonder. Was that signed by the autopen, I think, because they went to him and said, \"We're going to do a diffusion rule, Mr. President.\" \"What? What?\" \"It's okay. The autopen will take care of it.\" It's one of the greatest scandals in the history of our country, let me tell you.\n\n(41:23)Under my administration, we will maintain necessary protections for our national security, but we will never forget that the greatest threat of all is to forfeit the race and force our partners into rival technology. We're not going to do that. We're not going to do that. Okay. Not going to let that happen. That could be the end.\n\n(41:48)When I traveled to the Middle East and May, every leader I met was thrilled to do business with American tech firms and with America. And they were all thrilled to meet me, believe it or not. It's hard to believe, isn't it, but they were.\n\n(42:01)By the way, the most powerful woman in the world is here today. Susie Wiles, stand up please. Susie Wiles, Chief of Staff. She can take out a country with a mere phone call. No, they just voted her the most powerful woman anywhere in the world. She might be the most powerful person in the world, I think. But she's done a fantastic… hasn't she done a good job though, huh? Good.\n\n(42:27)But we're going to come home with trillions and trillions of dollars in deals and that's the way it is. But the king of Saudi Arabia… We met three great leaders. I went to three countries, predominantly king of Saudi Arabia said… And I can say that Qatar and UAE, the leaders, brilliant guys, great people, they said the same thing. They said, \"You know what? That one year ago, your country was dead. It was a dead country.\" They were looking at China, they were looking at other places, \" but you had a dead country. And today Mr. president, you have the hottest country anywhere in the world.\" They said that and they meant it so strongly.\n\n(43:11)And when I went to NATO two weeks ago, where we made the deal where they pay 5% instead of 2%, they said the same exact thing. They said, \"Boy, I tell you what a difference it is. A year ago, you people were dead. We didn't think you were going to make it as a country. Today you're the hottest country in the world.\" They all said it. All those leaders said it, 30 of them.\n\n(43:33)So today I'm signing another major executive order that will turn America into an AI export powerhouse. Under this order, Secretary Lutnick and Secretary Marco Rubio… Marco Rubio is doing a great job as Secretary of State… will work to rapidly expand American AI exports of all kinds, from chips to software to data storage of all kinds. And that's very important. That's going to give you the freedom to do what you want to do.\n\n(44:05)And third, once and for all, we are getting rid of woke. Is that okay? I know you had to hire all woke people. I heard you had to hire all woke people under some of these things. How about the chips where they give you the chip nonsense where they give you billions of dollars if you only build a chip company? These people have plenty of money. They don't need the money. They need the permits, they need the rights to do it. They don't want to pay tariffs so they come and they build here. That's why they're coming here.\n\n(44:34)Number one, they like me, but they like not having to pay tariffs even more, and they're coming. But Biden gave billions of dollars to companies that have nothing but cash. And they don't say where to build, they just give them money. But here's the problem; they have to hire lots of woke people and they say, \"woke isn't for this particular industry.\" We've noticed that. They're not for a lot of industries if you\n\nDonald Trump (45:00):\n\nYou want to know the truth? So the guidelines were impossible. They're going to give you money, but you got to hire this and this and this and that. And I don't want to get into it too much because I don't want any controversy today. But you have to hire a lot of people that were not into this particular world that you're in. And so therefore, all the money they gave didn't mean a damn thing.\n\n(45:22)One of Biden's worst executive orders established toxic diversity, equity and inclusion ideology as a guiding principle of American AI development. You immediately knew that was the end of your development. But the American people do not want woke Marxist lunacy in the AI models, and neither do other countries. They don't want it. They don't want anything to do with it. That's why on Day One, I very proudly terminated Joe Biden's order on woke AI effective immediately. You don't have any of those. Crazy rule, crazy rule.\n\n(45:56)And in just a moment, I will be signing an order banning the federal government for procuring AI technology that has been infused with partisan bias or ideological agendas, such as critical race theory, which is ridiculous. And from now on, the US government will deal only with AI that pursues truth, fairness, and strict impartiality. We're not going to go through the craziness that we've gone through for the last four years. And then we skip four and then you go back and it started then, but it hung around a little while. Now it's not hanging around at all. Now, it's actually very uncool. As somebody told me the other day, \"It's so uncool to be woke.\"\n\n(46:37)I encourage all American companies to join us in rejecting poisonous Marxism in our technology. It'll be very interesting to see what's happening in New York because they're actually thinking about electing a communist in New York. They like to call him a socialist. He's not a socialist. He's a communist. But don't worry, you're going to be okay. He still has to get his money from the White House and that's not going to happen until he shapes up.\n\n(47:03)But as an example, we are not going to allow men to play in women's sports. That's an example. That's one. And they say that's an 80-20 number. They say 80% would be against it. No, it's not 80-20. It's about 97-3. And I don't know who the three are. I've never seen anybody. I've never had a person, I see everybody, I'm a very open person. They come up to me and they talk to me. I've never had anybody come up. \"Sir, you have to let men play in women's sports.\" I've never had it. I deal with hundreds and thousands of people. Every time I talk to somebody, nobody's ever… They talk about AI, they talk about everything. But they've never said, \"You got to allow… This is ridiculous. Men should be allowed to play in women's sports.\"\n\n(47:54)It's sort of crazy, isn't it? Huh? You have to see. Did you see the race? It was a race, a long-distance marathon, one of those all-day deals. And we had one of the great female runners, and we had one of the great male runners. And at the end of the day, he won the race by five hours and 14 seconds. They waited around for the really good athlete female. It's very demeaning to women, I want to tell you that. But they waited. Her parents were waiting for hours. Somebody said, \"Why don't you go back to the hotel and sleep for a few hours and come back and meet your daughter?\" This is what they do. You got to see the weightlifting records, though. They're the best of all. Woman lifted 212 pounds. It was a world record. It held for 18 years, and now a man who transitioned came up and looked at the bar. \"How much is it?\" \"212 pounds.\" \"Oh, let me try it.\" I think he broke the record by 109 pounds. It's going to be a long time. It's going to be a long time before a woman catches that.\n\n(48:58)And these are great athletes and great people, and it's demeaning. And who the hell wants this? We're off of that whole standard because I just tell you those as examples. We're off of it. The reason the last administration was so eager to regulate and restrict AI was so they could limit this technology to just a few large companies, allowing them to centralize it, censor it, control it, weaponize it. And they would weaponize. They're a very dishonest group of people. You probably saw that because we caught them in the act. We really caught them. We had it before, but now we really have them. We have it where it counts.\n\n(49:33)But this is the exact opposite of my approach. The unique strength of the American tech industry has always come from its startups and small tech. It comes through small. Jensen was small. Well, you have a small, I think so. When you started in your bedroom, I think you were small, right? You started as very small, and now he's really become very amazing.\n\n(49:55)If you regulate them too much, you kill the source of American genius and technological power. I believe that Joe Biden had a plan to lose the AI race. I think he wanted to lose it because his plan would never have worked. It would've never been successful. You would've spent a lot of money and you wouldn't have been able to win. They didn't allow you to win. But we have a plan which only admires and respects the winners.\n\n(50:21)Every citizen should take incredible pride in the inspiring feats of American innovators who are pushing the bounds of human knowledge and achievement. The people of Open AI, Google, Meta, and countless startups are proving once again that America is just impossible to beat. You're not going to be beaten. We're not going to let that happen. When you do your best, when you work your hardest, and when you're allowed to be free of horrible, foolish regulation… And can have regulation, but it's going to be sensible, smart regulation, there's nobody who's going to beat you.\n\n(50:59)As we push even further into this exciting frontier, let us never forget that all of this prosperity and progress has come from the culture of freedom and hard work, merit, ambition, and risk-taking passed down from one generation of Americans to the next. Silicon Valley rose to wealth, fame, and glory by exemplifying these values. And it will win this race, not by rejecting them, but by embracing them like they have never been embraced before. We must put America first. This is a nation that invented the light bulb, the telegraph, the television, the telephone, the computer chip, the smartphone, the GPS, the integrated circuit, and even the Internet. Basically, we invented everything. What is left? We invented everything. And now it's AI.\n\n(51:55)We invented everything. Does anyone have anything else to say? And now we're going to take it to a new level. But Americans were the first to fly a plane, first to harness the atom, and first to plant our flag on the Moon. We mastered the industrial age, we created the digital age, and now we are leading the world into the golden age indeed, the golden age of America. With your help, that golden age will be built by American workers. It will be powered by American energy. It will be run on American technology, improved by American artificial intelligence. And it will make America richer, stronger, greater freer, and more powerful than ever before. And I will now do my share by going and signing a name. Without an autopen, I will sign it. If we had one, I wouldn't use it anyway. But we will sign it autopen free, and we will say, \"Donald J. Trump.\"\n\n(52:57)God bless America. And God bless you, and good luck because the race has just begun and you're going to win it. Thank you very much, everybody.\n\n(53:06)Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 1 (53:25):\n\nMr. President, the first executive order that we've prepared for your signature today relates to federal permitting for data center infrastructure. As you mentioned during your speech, this is a crucial issue affecting the entire AI industry. What this executive order will do is establish fast-track permitting and ensure that the federal government is working to get data centers approved and through the permitting pipeline as quickly as possible.\n\nDonald Trump (54:20):\n\nOkay.\n\nSpeaker 1 (54:20):\n\nAs you said before, sir, it's absolutely essential that American AI models and the American AI industry dominates the future of this industry around the world. What this next executive order will do is promote through various instrumentalities of the federal government, the export abroad of American AI models to ensure American AI dominance in the future.\n\nDonald Trump (54:46):\n\nOkay.\n\nSpeaker 1 (55:08):\n\nAnd lastly, sir, as you said in your speech, we don't want woke AI. We want AI models based on accurate information, that give accurate information and accurate answers. This executive order will ensure that when the federal government procures or promotes different AI models, that those AI models are ideologically neutral. That they don't embrace wokeism and critical race theory, and all of these terrible theories that have done so much damage to our country.\n\nDonald Trump (55:37):\n\nThank you. Thank you very much, everybody. Good luck. Good luck. Thank you, everybody.\n\nMUSIC (56:46):\n\n(Brass band, instrumental)",

    "transcript": "Donald Trump (00:00):\n\nWe're going to talk about trade today, and we're very close to finishing a trade deal, big trade deal actually. And we do a lot of business with you. It's a lot of income coming in for both groups, but I was surprised to see the kind of numbers. They're very big and they're going to get bigger under what we're doing and what we're proposing. And I just want to thank you for being with us. It's a great honor. You and your representatives, it's really a great, great honor.\n\n(00:27)We have a big announcement. AstraZeneca, the big drug company, is going to spend $50 billion, just announced, $50 billion in the United States in order to build various places all over the country. Big manufacturing plants, pharmaceutical plants all over the country. So, that's an honor. And he said they did that because of the election and because of the fact that the tariffs are placed. So, they're building their facilities in New York. $50 billion. That's a big investment, and it's going to be a very good investment, I have no doubt about it. So, thank you to AstraZeneca. And with that, I'd like to have you say a few words, please.\n\nPresident Marcos (01:08):\n\nThank you very much, Mr. President. Of course, we're all very happy to be here to once again reaffirm the very strong ties between the Philippines and the United States, the ties that they go back over 100 years. And considering the context in which we live these days, especially in my part of the world, this has evolved into as important a relationship as is possible to have. We must remember that the United States is only our only treaty partner in the Philippines, and that has stood us in good stead over the years, certainly through the Second World War.\n\n(01:53)And the cultural memory of all Filipinos, down to even the school children, is that our strongest, closest, most reliable ally has always been the United States. And that is something that we value, that we are grateful for, and that we will continue to foster as we go on. With the leadership of President Trump, I am very confident that we will be able to achieve that. I think it is worthwhile to remember that it was President Trump who, in his first term, characterized the relationship between the Philippines and the United States as ironclad. And that has been necessarily the case since that time that you made that statement, sir. And it is something that the Philippines will always hold close to its heart. Thank you once again, and we are honored, and it is our great pleasure to be here and to visit with the President of the United States.\n\nDonald Trump (03:01):\n\nThank you very much.\n\nPresident Marcos (03:02):\n\nThank you, sir.\n\nDonald Trump (03:02):\n\nIt's my great honor. Any questions for us?\n\nSpeaker 2 (03:05):\n\nMr. President?\n\nDonald Trump (03:05):\n\nYeah, please, go ahead. Go ahead.\n\nSpeaker 1 (03:10):\n\nMr. President, do you think that Fed Chair Jerome Powell should be gone?\n\nDonald Trump (03:15):\n\nI think he's doing a bad job, but he's going to be out pretty soon anyway. In eight months, he'll be out. But I called him too late. He's too late all the time. He should have lowered interest rates many times. Europe lowered their rate 10 times, we lowered ours none, and it's causing a problem for people that want to buy a home. Look, our economy is so strong now, we're blowing through everything. We're setting records. You know that, you see that. And whether it's the Philippines or anything else, we're setting records at levels that nobody's ever seen before.\n\n(03:44)But you know what? People aren't able to buy a house because this guy is a numbskull. He keeps the rates too high, and probably doing it for political reasons. The only time I remember him cutting rates, I mean, he cut the rates just before the election to try and help Kamala or whoever he was trying to help. He probably didn't know. And he's building a building. He's $2.7 billion, they have a $900 million overrun. What is that? And that was given by Biden. That was another Biden deal. And this guy's building this building that's severely overrun. And what does he need the building for? What does he need? He needs space for more people?\n\n(04:24)So, they did a big study the other day and they called all of the great intellects and the great economists and all of the great everything, and it was 71, and only two got it right. Me and another gentleman that happens to be very smart. 69 people got it wrong, and the Fed got it more wrong than anybody. And he has these think tanks and they build buildings for people that think, and it's really not thinking. It's a little bit of combination of thinking, but it's something you sort of have or you don't have. The job he's done is just terrible. He ought to raise interest rates. We should be at 1%. We should be leading the world. Instead, we're paying 4%. And if you look at what that means, that's over $1 trillion in interest that we have to pay. That with the striking of a pen, we would be saving more than $1 trillion. Is that right, Scott?\n\nScott (05:24):\n\nYes, sir.\n\nDonald Trump (05:24):\n\nDo you have anything to say about it?\n\nScott (05:26):\n\nYes, sir. I called yesterday and this morning for the Fed to do a big internal investigation to understand not their monetary policy, but everything else. The Fed has had big mission creep and that's where a lot of the spending's going. That's why they're building these new or refurbishing these buildings. And I think they got to stay in their lane. And I think that based on the way they cut rates last fall, they should be cutting rates now.\n\nDonald Trump (05:57):\n\nIt's inconceivable. I know the Fed very well, that they can be spending $2.7 billion to build a building. They don't do anything. I mean, it's the greatest job. You show up one day, a half a day, you make a little speech, \"The economy's doing well, the economy's not doing well, we're going to raise interest.\" And he's got it wrong. That's why I call him too late. T-O-O, too late. And it's really too bad. But it is affecting people that want to buy houses, and that shouldn't happen.\n\nSpeaker 1 (06:23):\n\nAnd Mr. President, [inaudible 00:06:26]-\n\nDonald Trump (06:26):\n\nAnd he should lower them. Those rates should be three points lower. That's what they should be. Three points lower. Maybe more than that.\n\nSpeaker 2 (06:32):\n\n[inaudible 00:06:33].\n\nSpeaker 3 (06:33):\n\nI would like to ask both for you, one person, Mr. President Marcos. Next year, Philippines going to be the rotating chair of ASEAN. I wonder, how do you plan to balance your relationship between the United States and China? And for President Trump, [inaudible 00:06:51] yesterday said, if you are going to Beijing in September, they wouldn't rule out a meeting between you and President Putin. Is such a meeting possible? And how soon do you plan to visit China?\n\nDonald Trump (07:02):\n\nWell, we have a lot of meetings possible. President Xi has invited me to China, and we'll probably be doing that in the not too distant future, a little bit out but not too distant. And I've been invited by a lot of people, and we'll make those decisions pretty soon. Please.\n\nPresident Marcos (07:21):\n\nWell, as you say, we are chairing ASEAN in 2026. There is no need, in a sense, to balance, as you characterize, to balance our relationship within the United States and China, simply because our foreign policy's an independent one. And we are essentially concerned with the defense of our territory and the exercise of our sovereign rights. Now, whether we do this, not alone, we need to do this with our partners. And again, our strongest partner has always been the United States, but of course we are trying to form coalitions and multilateral relations so that those like-minded nations who share the same values as we do, who hew to international law, most specifically the UNCLOS, present that position very clearly to anyone who has intentions of unilaterally changing the world order. And that is where, that is how we are guided.\n\nDonald Trump (08:38):\n\nAnd I don't mind if he gets along with China because we're getting along with China very well. We have a very good relationship. In fact, the magnets, which is a little complex piece of material, but the magnets are coming out very well where they're sending them in record numbers. We're getting along with China very well, and I don't mind\n\nDonald Trump (09:00):\n\nIf the president dealt with China, that's meant, Chris, I think he has to do what's right for his country. I've always said, \"Make the Philippines great again.\" Do whatever you need to do, but your dealing with China wouldn't bother me at all.\n\nSpeaker 4 (09:13):\n\nWell, now it is something that we have to do in any case, certainly. That the-\n\nJournalists (09:17):\n\n[inaudible 00:09:18].\n\nSpeaker 7 (09:17):\n\nWhen are you coming to the Philippines?\n\nSpeaker 5 (09:22):\n\nMr. President, do you support the Justice Department seeking a new interview with Ghislaine Maxwell, and George Urge the Attorney General to see?\n\nDonald Trump (09:30):\n\nI don't know anything about it. They're going to what? Meet her?\n\nSpeaker 5 (09:32):\n\nYour Deputy Attorney General has reached out to Ghislaine Maxwell's attorney asking for a new interview.\n\nDonald Trump (09:38):\n\nYeah, I don't know about it, but I think it's something that sounds appropriate to do. Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 5 (09:42):\n\nDo you have any concern that your Deputy Attorney General is your former attorney, would be conducting the interview, given he has a past relationship with you?\n\nDonald Trump (09:50):\n\nNo, I have no concern. He's a very talented person. He's very smart. I didn't know that they were going to do it. I don't really follow that too much. It's sort of a witch hunt. Just a continuation of the witch hunt. The witch hunt that you should be talking about is they caught President Obama absolutely cold, Tulsi Gabbard. What they did to this country in 2016, starting in 2016, but going up all the way, going up to 2020 in the election, they tried to rig the election and they got caught. And there should be very severe consequences for that. When we caught Hillary Clinton, I said, \"You know what? Let's not go too far here. It's the ex-wife of a president,\" and I thought it was sort of terrible, and I let her off the hook, and I'm very happy I did. But it's time to start… after what they did to me, and whether it's right or wrong, it's time to go after people.\n\n(10:48)Obama's been caught directly. So people say, \"Oh, you know, a group.\" It's not a group. It's Obama. His orders are on the paper. The papers are signed, the papers came right out of their office, they sent everything to be highly classified. Well, the highly classified's been released. And what they did in 2016 and in 2020 is very criminal. It's criminal at the highest level. So that's really the things you should be talking about. I know nothing about the other, but I think it's appropriate that they do go.\n\nSpeaker 8 (11:19):\n\nCan I ask you about that, Mr. President?\n\nDonald Trump (11:21):\n\nYeah.\n\nSpeaker 8 (11:21):\n\nTulsi Gabbard has submitted a criminal referral to the Department of Justice. From your perspective, who should the DOJ target as part of their investigation? What specific figures in the Obama administration?\n\nDonald Trump (11:35):\n\nWell, based on what I read, and I read pretty much what you read, it would be President Obama. He started it. And Biden was there with him, and Comey was there, and Clapper. The whole group was there. Brennan, they were all there in a room. Right here, this was the room. This is much more beautiful than it was then, but that's okay. I have nice pictures up, they came out of the vaults. They were in there for a hundred years. This is much more beautiful. We have the Declaration of Independence now in the room, which wasn't here. I guess people didn't feel too good about putting it here, but I do. But you know what? If you look at those papers, they have them stone cold, and it was President Obama. It wasn't lots of people all over the place. It was them too, but the leader of the gang was President Obama, Barack Hussein Obama. Have you heard of him? And except for the fact that he gets shielded by the press for his entire life, that's the one they… Look, he's guilty. It's not a question… I like to say, let's give it time. It's there, he's guilty. This was treason. This was every word you can think of. They tried to steal the election, they tried to obfuscate the election. They did things that nobody's ever even imagined, even in other countries. You've seen some pretty rough countries, this man has seen some pretty rough countries, but you've never seen anything like it. And we have all of the documents. And from what Tulsi told me, she's got thousands of additional documents coming. So President Obama, it was his concept, his idea, but he also got it from crooked Hillary Clinton. Crooked is a $3 bill.\n\n(13:26)Hillary Clinton and her group, the Democrats spent $12 million to Christopher Steele to write up a report that was a total fake report. Took two years to figure that out. But it came out that it was a total fake report. It was made up fiction. The one thing they weren't able to do was to… And probably the only thing I respect about the press in years is the press refused to write it before the election. They refused to put it in. The Steele report was a disaster. All lies, all fabrication, all admitted. An admitted fraud. She paid $12 million, and the Democrats, for that report to a wise guy named Christopher Steele. He wrote a phony report and they wanted to get that report in before the election. And I'll tell you what? I talk about all the time, the fake news, how bad it is. But in this case, they wouldn't do it. They saw it, they read it, and they said, \"We don't believe it.\". And it was only after substantially like a month and a half after the election that it got printed, and it was a big wisp. It was just like a bang of nothing because the election had ended. If that report had gotten published by the New York Times or somebody, and I respect the times for maybe only this, because they're crooked as you can be, they're a terrible paper, a crooked, corrupt paper, but for this one moment, they said, \"This is bullshit, we can't put this in.\" And neither could any… Because they do things very badly. It's got a nice name, but in my opinion it's a terrible paper and it can be corrupt. But just so you know, they didn't take the Steele report… it was the dossier, remember the famous dossier? I called it the Fake News dossier.\n\n(15:20)The news wouldn't publish it. And I'm amazed, they had two and a half months. It was finished two and a half months. That was supposed to be what was going to happen. And it got published a couple of months after the election. And frankly, nobody cared too much about it. But that was a big thing. No, no, we caught Hillary Clinton, we caught Barack Hussein Obama. They're the ones, and then you have many, many people under them. Susan Rice, they're all there. The names are all there. And I guess they figured they're going to put this in classified information and nobody will ever see it again, but it doesn't work that way. And it's the most unbelievable thing I think I've ever read. So you want to take a look at that and stop talking about nonsense, because this is big stuff.\n\n(16:08)Never has a thing like this happened in the history of our country. And by the way, it morphed into the 2020 race. And the 2020 race was rigged and it was a rigged election. And because it was rigged, we have millions of people in our country, we had inflation, we solved the inflation problem. But millions and millions of people came into our country because of that. And people that shouldn't have been… People from gangs and from jails and from mental institutions, people that we don't want in our country, and people that we're getting out. Dangerous people. 11,888 murderers, many of them, 50%, more than 50% murdered more than one person. I hate to say this with such a distinguished guest, but they asked me a question, I got to answer the question.\n\n(16:58)No, Barack Hussein Obama is the ringleader, Hillary Clinton was right there with him, and so was sleepy Joe Biden. And so were the rest of them. Comey, Clapper, the whole group. And they tried to rig an election and they got caught. And then they did rig the election in 2020. And then because I knew I won that election by a lot, I did it a third time and I won in a landslide. Every swing state, won the popular vote. But I won that all the same way in 2020. And look at the damage that was caused.\n\nJournalists (17:29):\n\n[inaudible 00:17:31].\n\nSpeaker 6 (17:36):\n\nMr. President, how crucial is the ammunitions hub that the US plans to build in Subic, and in the zone corridor, considering that these will be built in areas that hosts strategic ports, as well as military air bases?\n\nDonald Trump (17:47):\n\n[inaudible 00:17:47] ammunition?\n\nSpeaker 6 (17:48):\n\nYes, the US house, Congressional Committee on appropriations approved budget to-\n\nDonald Trump (17:53):\n\nWell, it's very important, otherwise we wouldn't have approved it.\n\nSpeaker 6 (17:56):\n\nSo are you-\n\nDonald Trump (17:57):\n\nYeah, it's very important. We need ammunition.\n\nDonald Trump (18:00):\n\nWe're going to end up in a few months we'll have more ammunition than any country has ever had. We're going to have more missiles than any country has ever had. We're going to have all the speedy missiles. We'll have the speedy ones, the slow ones, the accurate ones, the ones that are slightly less accurate. We have everything. But we will have more ammunition than any country has ever had. It's very important to me.\n\n(18:20)Okay. Go ahead, please, red?\n\nSpeaker 9 (18:25):\n\nSir, when you say that you're close to making a trade deal, what gaps remain? And for President Marcos, sir, I was just wondering, do you not think that perhaps the Philippines hosting US missile systems could be considered escalatory by China, especially because they can strike [inaudible 00:18:42] China? Thank you.\n\nDonald Trump (18:44):\n\nWell, it's an honor to be with this gentleman. I've known him and I've known his family actually, but I've known him, and he's… I assume you're from the Philippines. Are you from the Philippines?\n\nSpeaker 9 (18:54):\n\nYes, sir.\n\nDonald Trump (18:55):\n\nIt's good. You're very lucky to be from the Philippines, right? It's a great place. But we're going to have a very good relationship. I know you had some problems with another president, and it was not your fault, it was the president's fault, and the country was maybe tilting toward China, but we untilted it very, very quickly. But you did have… You had a country that was tilting toward China for a period of time, and I just don't think that would've been good for you. You could deal with China, you should deal with China, but when I got elected, everything changed and they came right back to us.\n\nSpeaker 10 (19:37):\n\nPresident Trump, would you consider extending-\n\nDonald Trump (19:37):\n\nSay it again? Yeah. Brian, go ahead.\n\nBrian (19:37):\n\nOh, Mr. president. I just wanted to piggyback off the-\n\nSpeaker 9 (19:39):\n\nSorry, I had a question to President Marcos.\n\nBrian (19:40):\n\nI'll let you-\n\nPresident Marcos (19:41):\n\nYes, yes. Sorry. What was the question again?\n\nSpeaker 9 (19:43):\n\nIt was about whether having US missiles posted in the Philippines would be considered escalatory by China?\n\nPresident Marcos (19:51):\n\nAll of the what we consider part of the modernization of the Philippine military is really as a response to the circumstances that surround the situation around the South China Sea and now the, what we used to refer to as Asia Pacific, which we have expanded now to the Indo-Pacific. And if… We would certainly like any kind of military spending, we would wish that it wasn't necessary, but it is. And so that is what we are doing.\n\n(20:21)And as an adjunct to the question about the ammunition production, this is actually… The United States is assisting the Philippines in what we call our self-reliance defense program, which is to allow us to be self-reliant and to be able to stand our own two feet, whatever the circumstances that occur in the future. And the reason that we have encouraged more interaction with the United States is because it is, again, it is necessary. And it is not just with the United States. It is with all our neighboring countries and even countries as far afield as the Scandinavian countries, the EU. And so this is an ongoing process. And again, I will stress the point that we do this because we feel it is necessary.\n\nDonald Trump (21:20):\n\nAnd don't forget… Don't forget, just as tantamount to what you're asking, the Philippines were loaded up with ISIS and a lot of terrorists, and they were at very, very dangerous point. And during my administration, we went in and we wiped them out working with the Philippines, but we wiped them out. But if we didn't go in, I don't know what would've happened. I don't know who would be your president right now. But we spent a lot of time and a lot of talent on going into the Philippines and wiping out terrorists. They had a tremendous problem-\n\nPresident Marcos (21:55):\n\nWe did.\n\nDonald Trump (21:55):\n\n… during my administration, and we cleaned it up. We got them out. And now you really have a good, solid country again.\n\nPresident Marcos (22:01):\n\nI believe so, yes.\n\nBrian (22:04):\n\nMr. President.\n\nDonald Trump (22:05):\n\nBrian.\n\nBrian (22:05):\n\nLet me follow up on the housing question. We've got no tax on tips, no tax on overtime, no tax on Social Security. How important is it we have no tax on home sales capital gains to unleash the housing market in this country?\n\nDonald Trump (22:17):\n\nWell, we're thinking about that, but would also unleash it just by lowering the interest rates. If the Fed would lower the rates, we wouldn't even have to do that. But we are thinking about no tax on capital gains on houses. And I'm very impressed that you asked that question because nobody knew that. How did you find that out? That's very-\n\nBrian (22:36):\n\nI wonder why there's [inaudible 00:22:36]-\n\nDonald Trump (22:36):\n\nThere's a leaker. There's a leaker.\n\nBrian (22:39):\n\nI've [inaudible 00:22:40] a question. I find it a very interesting world that we know more about two people at a Coldplay concert just hours after that viral video then we know of Thomas Crooks one year after attempting to assassinate you. What is holding back the investigation on Thomas Crooks?\n\nDonald Trump (22:56):\n\nWell, they've reported to me and they've told me things, and they really say they haven't found anything that was abnormal. I would say this: The Secret Service was very brave because they were right there and they jumped on me. They made a mistake. They should have had somebody on that roof, and they should have had communication with the local police who also, they did a very good job, but they made some mistakes. And we have a whole different group of people now.\n\n(23:23)I don't think any… Look, anything can happen. But I think we have the best people anywhere in the world right now, and I think they've learned. And they went into him in great detail. They gave me the whole thing. And what can I do? They say that it was just a nut job that was looking to do this.\n\n(23:43)And I spoke with the FBI, the new FBI. I spoke to the FBI. If it was the old FBI, I wouldn't have believed a thing they said because the old FBI under Comey was crooked as hell. He was one of the most crooked. Everybody should read the Horowitz report. Unfortunately, Bill Barr didn't use it. But the Horowitz report, not appointed by me, it was a report on Comey and the FBI. It is one of the worst shots at a human being I think I've ever seen.\n\n(24:14)In fact, The New York Times did an editorial that was one of the worst editorials I've ever seen about anybody. That was about Comey. You ought to go back and get… And Barr didn't use it because he didn't have the guts to use it or something happened, I don't know. Too bad. He went to Mr. Durham. Instead of doing the Durham, all that he used is the Horowitz report.\n\n(24:34)And I always felt badly for Horowitz, frankly, because he's a Democrat, I guess. He was appointed by a Democrat. But that report has gotten lost, and it shouldn't be lost. You should all go back. It should be mandatory reading. Go back and read the Horowitz report on Comey and his cronies, and you'll see exactly… We're going to add that to all the stuff that we found. It just confirms it.\n\n(25:02)But what we found is even more so. Now, we found absolute… This isn't like evidence, or… This is like proof, irrefutable proof that Obama was seditious, that Obama was trying to lead a coup, and it was with Hillary Clinton, with all these other people, but Obama headed it up. And I get a kick when I hear everyone talks about people I never even heard of. It was this one. No, no, it was Obama. He headed it up and it says so right in the papers. Got everything. Got everything.\n\n(25:37)This is the biggest scandal in the history of our country. And it really goes on to even the autopen, because it all relates to the same thing. It all started the same sick minds. You have an autopen, which is a tremendous… Well, we don't have a president. We have an autopen that signs everything. I'll bet you sign everything. You don't have autopens.\n\nPresident Marcos (25:56):\n\nNo, I do not.\n\nDonald Trump (25:58):\n\nEverybody. Who doesn't sign… You're the president of a country. But it's all that whole thing leading right up to the end of it is the autopen. And the autopen was used by people, and Biden knew nothing about it. Biden knew nothing about it. They were signing documents that he knew nothing about.\n\n(26:15)As an example, they released the Unselect Committee of Liability. The Unselect Committee spent two years grilling everybody, and then they destroyed all the evidence. You know why? Because the evidence made them guilty. And he gave them all a pardon, the Cheney, all the scum that was on the Unselect Committee, Crying Adam Kinzinger and Democrats, and he gave them a pardon.\n\n(26:42)Do you have something else? Go ahead.\n\nBrian (26:43):\n\nI was just going to add one more thing on Adam Schiff. The Director Pulte reports that Adam Schiff claims he lived in a one-bedroom apartment. How does a family of four, you're a developer, a very successful developer. How does a family of four live in a one-bedroom apartment?\n\nDonald Trump (26:58):\n\nNo. It looks like Adam Schiff\n\nDonald Trump (27:00):\n\n… really did a bad thing. They have him, now let's see what happens. It's not up to me. I stay out of it purposely. But it's mortgage loan fraud, it's a big deal. He defrauded banks, and insurance companies, and the federal government. But it's very simple, it's mortgage loan fraud. And you're right, it's a lot of people to live in a one-bedroom apartment, right? But he put it down. But he has a lot of other things far worse than that. So no, Adam Schiff, they have him 100% on mortgage fraud. Now, if it was anybody else in this room except you, you would have no problem. But anybody else in this room, you'd have a problem. I'd have a problem. Yeah, please.\n\nSpeaker 11 (27:46):\n\nSir, there was a hearing yesterday on the Harvard case. Would you allow Harvard to get their federal dollars back as a part of any agreement with the administration?\n\nDonald Trump (27:54):\n\nNo. Harvard's been given $7 billion, can you believe it, by the Fed. $7 billion. And we want money to go to all universities, not Harvard. Harvard got more than anybody else. They have $52 billion. They get huge tax incentives, and tax breaks on that $52 billion. But they have $52 billion, and they got $7 billion over a short period of time. And we have a very hostile judge appointed by Barack Hussein Obama. A very, very hostile judge, who knows exactly right from wrong, but we expect to win it on appeal. She hasn't given a decision yet, but she's very hostile. She was put by Barack Hussein Obama. And generally speaking, anybody that does that, we're going to have problems with. We won the case yesterday. Anybody that was there that was a neutral would say, we easily won the case. But a lot of the case and a big part of it is going to be how much money Harvard gets in the future. That's not part of the case, and they're not going to get very much.\n\nSpeaker 12 (29:02):\n\nMr. President-\n\nSpeaker 13 (29:03):\n\nWhere are we in terms of negotiating about the reciprocal tariff? How far are we-\n\nDonald Trump (29:10):\n\nWith who?\n\nSpeaker 13 (29:10):\n\nWith the Philippines.\n\nDonald Trump (29:10):\n\nOh.\n\nSpeaker 13 (29:13):\n\nYes sir. How far are we-\n\nDonald Trump (29:13):\n\nAre you from the Philippines?\n\nSpeaker 13 (29:14):\n\nYes sir. I am from the Philippines. How far are we from achieving-\n\nDonald Trump (29:17):\n\nWell, it's tough. He's a very tough negotiator. So far we're not there because he's negotiating too tough. In fact, I used to like him better than I do now. He's too tough. But we'll probably agree to something. But he is a strong negotiator. He loves your country.\n\nSpeaker 12 (29:33):\n\nMr. President. Mr. President.\n\nSpeaker 14 (29:36):\n\nWhen are you coming to the Philippines?\n\nSpeaker 12 (29:38):\n\nSir, you talked a lot about the severe consequences that those who are involved in the Russia hoax must face [inaudible 00:29:44], sir. What are the next steps now that these documents are out there and Tulsi Gabbad-\n\nDonald Trump (29:48):\n\nWell, the Justice Department would have to act, and we have a very competent, very good, very loyal to our country person in Pam Bondi. Very respected. And it is going to be her decision.\n\nSpeaker 12 (30:03):\n\nFollow up to that, sir. Kristi Noem was in New York City visiting an off-duty CBP officer who was allegedly shot this weekend by an illegal alien who came into the country during the previous administration. What is your message to any local leaders who continued to push sanctuary city policies after this nearly tragic incident?\n\nDonald Trump (30:22):\n\nSo the only thing I don't understand, because you like to understand things and we're all smart people and all, but why would they allow 21 million people into our country, unvetted, unchecked? You don't allow it. You wouldn't allow people in. He's tough. No, their country's run properly. Biden and his group of thugs… And I don't think it was Biden, I think it was the people that surrounded that beautiful Resolute desk right behind you, they allowed 21 million people, probably much more than that, and many of them came from jails and gangs and drug dealers and mental institutions, insane asylums. Many of them are very sick. 21 million, probably 25 million, probably even more than that. And we're getting them out. Many were murderers, as I said, they killed people. Many killed more than one person. Stone-cold murderers. I don't understand why they would've allowed that. There's only two reasons.\n\n(31:19)The vote. Because they want voters, that's one reason. I don't think they would've done it for that, because they cheat. They're so good at cheating, they don't need that. But the vote. And the second reason is they hate our country. I think they hate our country. I actually do. And it's the biggest problem. Much of our time is spent with… We have the strongest border anywhere in the world now, maybe even stronger than your border if you can believe it. No people came in last month, zero. Which is pretty… I'm not even sure I can believe that, but liberals are the ones that do that calculation. But we had no people come in. A year ago we had hundreds of thousands of people come in. Hundreds of thousands of people, and they flowed in. And if it wasn't for the election, it would've been millions of people came in last year.\n\n(32:07)So millions of people prior to election time, they allowed millions and millions of people to come into our… You saw it, they'd opened the gates. If you took an Alabama LSU football game that holds 128,000 people, I was there, 128,000 people. And I liked them and they liked me. But if you took that and doubled it, that's what used to flow into our country on a daily basis. It's not even believable. And we're getting them out. And we're starting with the worst ones. And we had a man shot yesterday, a police officer who's great gentlemen, shot right here in the throat, probably won't be able to speak again. But he was brave and he shot the other guy, and they ended up getting him. And you saw the scene where his friend took him to a hospital, and dumped him down on the sidewalk.\n\n(32:55)The whole thing was crazy. But why would anybody do to our country what these Democrats have done? And honestly, we can never forget it. We can never forget it. What they have done, the damage that they've done to America is very, very sad. Thank you very much everybody.\n\nSpeaker X (33:14):\n\n[inaudible 00:33:15]",

    "transcript": "Donald Trump (00:00):\n\n… pull them all back, we'll get everybody in, right John?\n\nJohn (00:02):\n\nYou heard that, didn't you?\n\nDonald Trump (00:07):\n\nBut we really did… We have a lot of great people, and a lot of really fantastic people, and they're doing a tremendous job.\n\n(00:14)You stayed in session for a marathon 10 consecutive weeks, and that's the longest of any Senate in 15 years, and you held over 400 votes, more than any Senate in 35 years, and they were successful votes. And just a few weeks ago, we had the biggest victory of them all when you passed the One Big Beautiful Bill, and I just signed it into law, and I call it the Great Big Beautiful Bill, but I got overridden by a couple of my people. They said, \"Let's call it the One Big,\" but it is really the Great Big. And we delivered the largest tax cut in American history, the largest spending cut in American history, the most deregulation in American history, and the largest border security investment in American history, and the biggest success on the border in American history.\n\n(01:05)As you know, last month, and we went from millions of people coming in, we had zero illegals coming into our country and we're trying to get our country straightened out, and you can't do that if they're going to come in by the tens of thousands. We had zero. Now, I'm not even sure I can believe zero, but it was a very liberal group, as you know, that keeps that tabulation, and they gave us a zero, so I think we'll take it, but it certainly wasn't very many.\n\n(01:38)And the One Big Beautiful Bill delivered on more Republican promises than any single piece of legislation that's ever been voted on before. And I want to thank Senate majority leader John Thune. Again, John, what you did is amazing, record setting, and you're a good man too. You're a very good man. He really is. Majority whip John Barrasso. John, thank you. What a man, what a guy. We got along from day one, right? He knew more about the medical stuff, and I said, \"What do you think about this, that?\" You did a fantastic job, and for a long time. Republican policy committee chair Shelley Moore Capito. Shelly, thank you. Thank you. Thank you Shelly. Senate finance committee chairman Mike Crapo. Good job. You know your stuff. I was calling, I was asking him some very tough questions on taxes. You always had the answer, some of which I didn't like, but that was okay. But you always had it. You know your business. Thank you, Mike. Great job.\n\n(02:56)Senate budget committee chairman, a gentleman named Lindsey Graham, just took a big lead in the polls. You're leading big. That's pretty good. Lindsey Graham. And all of you. I mean, just everyone in this room is special. You're all friends and you've just been incredible people. Because again, getting all of these votes with… Well, you can't lose two, and we had a couple, you can't lose two. And we actually had it where we were down much closer than this, and we said, \"We're a heart attack away from losing the Senate. We were just hoping everybody's going to stay good and [inaudible 00:03:37] right John?\n\nJohn (03:37):\n\nThat's right.\n\nDonald Trump (03:39):\n\nBut we had some pretty close moments. But I don't think anybody's ever come close to doing this with a pretty tight majority, to put it nicely. So now we have three. And I think we have a chance in the midterms. I don't understand why they say that when you win the presidency, you always almost automatically lose the midterms, because nobody's had a more successful period of time than we have. So based on that, we should do great, and we'll see. But nobody's done more than we have as a group. It's not me, it's all of us together. And I'd like to thank Vice President JD vance, who's here someplace. Thank you, thank you. And he's been so terrific, JD, and we appreciate it, and you helped us a lot during those late evenings over the last three nights, and you really have been tremendous.\n\n(04:30)And Secretary of State Marco Rubio. This man is traveling all over the place. He's always traveling. He's going to different countries. He loves it. He's a natural. He's a natural. There's never going to be anybody better than the job you're doing right now. We appreciate it. We have some big things coming up [inaudible 00:04:47] Marco, we have some big things coming up right? Some big things and some very positive things, and thank you very much. You're doing a fantastic job. Who would have thought we fought like… He was so tough. Ted, he was tough on that debate stand, right? And you were very tough on the debate stand too. You guys were brutal. Who would think they're my friends? And now they're my friends. Well, they said it about Lincoln, he brought in all his enemies. Well, I don't know. They were sort of enemies, but they were very talented people, I want to tell you that.\n\n(05:23)Director Russ Vought is here. And thank you very much, Russ. Where are you? Thank you. Great job. And all of the wonderful spouses. The most important people here are the spouses, because without the spouses, it wouldn't work. We want to thank you, and also for the time, because as your wives and husbands, they were very busy getting home at four o'clock. I can vouch for every single one of them getting home at four o'clock, five o'clock, six o'clock in the morning. And you're saying, \"Darling, were you really in Congress? Were you really sitting in your nice Senate seat?\" I don't know. But no, they worked long and hard. And you know what? They laughed. They never complained. They never complained once. Very few of them went back. They'd just sit late into the night while we got this final vote. It's pretty amazing.\n\n(06:24)In 2024 together, we won a mandate from the American people. We won every single swing state and the electoral college, 312 to 226. And that was a big… Remember they said, \"There is a path to 70.\" You have to have 70, 270, and \"There's a path to 270,\" and yeah, the path was 312. I remember I went to Nebraska to get a half, to get a single vote, and I went there and it turned out we didn't need it. There was a certain circumstance under which that would have been a very important vote, and they were great in Nebraska, but we didn't need it. So we got 312. We won the popular vote by millions of votes, so we won counties throughout America 2,750 to 525. Think of that. 2,750 to 525. That's called a landslide.\n\n(07:21)The One Big Beautiful Bill delivered on that mandate, and we've fulfilled so many of our promises. In fact, somebody said today, a person that's not particularly good for us said, that we actually fulfilled more promises than we promised, which is a pretty nice statement. You don't hear that very often, but it's true, by a lot actually. And that's just the beginning. In January, we passed Senator Katie Britt's Laken Riley Act. Where's Katie? Katie. And a few months ago we passed Senator Ted Cruz's… And this was done with a very fantastic woman named Melania, right? You worked together, First Lady, and you passed the Take It Down Act, something that was very important, that actually had very good bipartisan support, almost unanimous support. A couple of people… I won't tell you their names, but a couple of people. But that was incredible. So that was with Ted Cruz and Melania. We appreciate it, Ted. That was a great job.\n\n(08:26)And just this week we passed the Rescissions Act of 2025, slashing nearly $10 billion of waste, and I guess I could say some fraud and some abuse, but at least we can say waste. Almost $10 billion, and we have numerous other rescissions coming up, adding many more $10 billion to it, so we're saving a lot of money. And on Wednesday I signed the Halt Fentanyl Act, and earlier today I signed Senator Bill Hagerty's GENIUS Act, and he named it after me and I was really… Thank you. Thank you. Thank you Bill. Thank you very much. Thank you very much, that's why I liked it very… I pushed very hard because of that, but to make America the crypto capital of the world, and that's what it's become. China wanted it, a lot of countries want it, but we are so far ahead, I think nobody's going to be able to come close anymore. So I want to thank you very much. Great job.\n\n(09:30)We also did something that… Public broadcasting, they've been looking to get it out of there for billions and billions of dollars, and very, very unfair, very, very unfair reporting. I would say they make CNN look honest, and we got rid of it finally. We got rid of it. We got rid of billions of dollars that was wasted on that. And Ronald Reagan tried, everybody tried. Everybody tried since Ronald Reagan and before, and John, we got it out. And I know it doesn't sound so nice when they hear, \"That's terrible, public broadcast.\" It sounds so innocent. It's not innocent. It was brutal. It was brutal, very unfair. We achieved more in six months than almost any administration could accomplish in eight years, and we're going to have a lot of good six months left. We're going to have a six and another six and another six. So we'll keep going, and we're going to really do something.\n\n(10:27)Something I'm very proud of. We stopped a lot of wars. A lot of wars. And these were serious, serious wars would have been going on [inaudible 00:10:38] You had India-Pakistan. That was going, in fact planes were being shot out of the air. Five? Four or five, but I think five jets were shot down, actually, and Lindsey, that was getting worse and worse, wasn't it? That was looking like it was going to go… These are two serious nuclear countries, and they were hitting each other. It seems like a new form of warfare. You saw it recently when you looked at what we did in Iran, where we knocked out their nuclear capability. Totally knocked out. It's going to be gone for a long time. But there seems to be a hit and then another hit, a hit and another hit. It's a different thing.\n\n(11:17)But India and Pakistan were going at it, and they were back and forth and it was getting bigger and bigger, and we got it solved through trade. We said, \"You guys want to make a trade deal? We're not making a trade deal if you're going to be throwing around weapons.\" And maybe nuclear weapons. Both very powerful nuclear states. We did the Congo. This was going on for over 30 years, the Congo and Rwanda, and close to seven million people were really violently killed. This was a rough one, but going on over 30 years, and we had the various representatives here last week. The presidents will be coming to sign final documents, but we got that one solved.\n\n(12:02)Armenia and Azerbaijan, we worked magic there, and it's pretty close. If not, it's already done. And Gaza, we got most of the hostages back. We're going to have another 10 coming very shortly, and we hope to have that finished pretty quickly. And Steve Witkoff has been fantastic, he's done a great job in that. He's a very good man, good deal maker. I said, \"I need a good deal maker with a good personality,\" and there aren't too many of them, but Steve is, and he's done a great job.\n\n(12:38)Serbia, Kosovo, they were going at it. They've gone at it for years, I guess for centuries, but they've gone at it for years, and we got that one taken care of. And Egypt and Ethiopia, as you know, they've been fighting over the dam. Ethiopia built a dam with United States money, largely. It's one of the largest dams in the world, and it has one little problem. It doesn't allow much water going into the Nile River, so you can imagine Egypt's not thrilled, because they live off the Nile River. The Nile River, it's blood, it's heart, it's everything. And we think we have that one pretty well taken care of.\n\n(13:15)But that was a pretty bad thing. I was watching this as it was going up. I get pictures and satellites and everything, and I'm looking at this massive dam and I'm saying, \"Is that going to be blocking the water to the Nile?\" And anyway, that should have never happened the way it happened, but financed by the United States of America. The whole thing is a little crazy, but we got that solved. I think that's going to be solved pretty long term.\n\n(13:42)Over the next year and a half, we'll have an incredible record to share with the American people. As long as we continue to keep our promises to the voters, Americans will continue to stand by our side, and in 2026, the Republican majority, I think, is going to be stronger in both the House and the Senate, and I really think it's going to be potentially much stronger. Look, nobody has done what people have done, I think ever, I can say, just about ever in the Senate, and we did it all in six months. I think Sunday night is actually six months.\n\n(14:15)So I really congratulate the people in this room. It's incredible. And I did a good job, but I couldn't have done it without you. I couldn't have done it without great leadership. And it's really terrific, and I appreciate it very much. And I guess we have a very, very simple phrase that we've gone by. Make America great again. You know, it's as simple as it can be, and I remember our opponent Biden saying, \"We will stop 'America great again.'\" I said, \"You want to make America great again, Joe?\" He said, \"We will stop MAGA. We will stop MAGA.\" I said, \"No no, MAGA's a good thing. It's 'Make America great again.'\"\n\n(14:56)But the election we had was unbelievable. The result was pretty… They say one of great elections in a hundred and twenty-nine years, they're talking about. I said, \"Well, I don't know where the hundred and twenty-nine years goes, but we'll take it.\" But I just want to thank you, because without your help, we could not have done what we've done or even come close. So great job to John and everybody, we appreciate it very much, and we're going to have a good meal tonight. I said, give us the A meal, not the B or the C. And it's really a celebration of great political people, great political minds, and wonderful men and women. Thank you all very much. [inaudible 00:15:39] Thank you. Thank you, thank you.\n\nSpeaker 3 (15:39):\n\nThank you everybody.\n\n(15:39)Thanks guys. Thank you press, we're going to go right back out this way. East room.\n\nSpeaker 4 (16:03):\n\nGreat job.\n\nSpeaker 3 (16:03):\n\nThanks guys, you can go straight out the front.\n\n(16:03)Thank you. [inaudible 00:16:24] Thank you.",

    "transcript": "Speaker 1 (00:00):\n\n(silence)\n\nSpeaker 2 (17:00):\n\n(silence)\n\nPresident Trump (38:38):\n\nA smart, hard-working guy. So it's good to say hello to you. Congratulations. We've had a tremendous relationship, I have personally with Bahrain over the years and it has been a fantastic ally. And anything they needed we helped them and anything we needed they helped us. And we're going to be talking about a lot of different things, including the most perfect military maneuver that anybody's seen probably in 50 years, which took place a few weeks ago in Iran, knocked out their entire potential nuclear capacity and it was obliterated. I used that term. They said, well maybe that's too much. I said, no. It turned out it was more than obliterated. They can't go back. And we're just really going to talk about some things including trade. We're going to be discussing trade, we do a lot of trading with Bahrain. And we're going to have lunch after this, but we'll take some questions. First, I'd like to ask the Crown Prince to say a couple of words. And he also has a father who's living and well and doing fantastically as I understand it.\n\nCrown Prince (39:51):\n\nHe is.\n\nPresident Trump (39:52):\n\nAnd somebody who's respected all over the Middle East and all over the world. And thank you very much for being here.\n\nCrown Prince (39:57):\n\nThank you Mr. President. Thank you one and all. It is indeed a great honor to be here on this fine morning to put into action the relationship that exists between our two countries. We will be discussing security issues, we'll be discussing trade and investment, which is very important. We're very happy to be announcing $17 billion worth of deals that are coming to the United States. And this is real. This isn't-\n\nPresident Trump (40:26):\n\nIt's real money.\n\nCrown Prince (40:27):\n\nThese aren't fake deals. These are real deals.\n\nPresident Trump (40:28):\n\nThey don't have to borrow the money.\n\nCrown Prince (40:29):\n\nWe don't have to borrow it, it's coming in. And it only builds upon a legacy that we're very proud of. We have had a relationship in the civil side between our two countries since 1893 and formally since 1948. So may it long continue and we look forward to many, many more years of productive partnership. Thank you, Mr. President. You honor us.\n\nPresident Trump (40:53):\n\nWe will have that indeed, many good years. And I'd say right now is your top year and we appreciate the investment. It's a great… We left as you know, Saudi Arabia. We were just there, Saudi Arabia and Qatar was so great. Qatar was great. We had the UAE and we had a couple of other visits, but all great places and we left with $5.1 trillion of investment and they all want to be investing in the United States. I think we have over $16 trillion of investment coming in, which is a record, and we're only a little bit into the year. And let's say the first two months, I sort of took it easy because we had to fix up the Oval Office. I had to devote my time to fixing it up. But now we had to fix up our country. I think everyone is saying we have the hottest country now anywhere in the world. We were dead a year ago. We are a dead country and now we have the hottest country anywhere in the world.\n\nCrown Prince (41:55):\n\nThank you. Mr. President.\n\nSpeaker 3 (42:00):\n\n[inaudible 00:42:01] developments in Syria at the moment.\n\nPresident Trump (42:02):\n\nWell, I can't comment. I think I'll ask Marco to say a few words on Syria.\n\nMarco Rubio (42:06):\n\nYeah, it's complicated. Obviously these are historic long-time rivalries between different groups in the southwest of Syria, Bedouins, the Druze community, and it led to an unfortunate situation and a misunderstanding it looks like, between the Israeli side and the Syrian side. So we've been engaged with them all morning long and all night long with both sides. And we think we're on our way towards a real de-escalation and then hopefully get back on track in helping Syria build the country and arriving at a situation there in the Middle East that's far more stable. So in the next few hours we hope to see some real progress to end what you've been seeing over the last couple hours.\n\nSpeaker 4 (42:46):\n\nMr. President, Jerome Powell, do you have plans or have you're back considering firing Jerome Powell and what's your justification you're thinking about this to do this?\n\nPresident Trump (42:56):\n\nWell, he's too late. He's always been too late, hence his nickname too late. He should have cut interest rates a long time ago. Europe has cut them 10 times in the short period of time and we cut him none. The only time he cut them was just before the election to try and help Kamala or Biden, whoever the hell it was, because nobody really knew. Obviously that didn't work, but he tried to cut them for the Democrats, Kamala. How did that work out? You'll tell me it didn't work out too well, did it? I think he does a terrible job. He's costing us a lot of money and we fight through it.\n\n(43:36)The country's become so successful that it doesn't have a big impact, but it does hurt people wanting to get a mortgage. People want to buy a house. He's a terrible Fed chair. I was surprised he was appointed. I was surprised, frankly, that Biden put him in and extended him, but they did. So no, we're not planning on doing anything. We're very concerned. He's doing a little renovation for 2.5 billion of the Fed, building a renovation, and they have a close-to $900 million cost overrun. And it's a shame. But the biggest cost overrun is the cost overrun for interest rates because we should be paying three points lower and we would save a trillion dollars a year in interest if that were the case. And all it is the stroke of a pen.\n\n(44:29)And that goes for his board too, because his board is not doing the job because they should try and rein this guy in. So he is doing a lousy job. But no, I'm not talking about that. Fortunately we get to make a change in the next, what, eight months or so. And we'll pick somebody that's good and we'll pick somebody, I just want a fair job. We want to see lower interest rates. Our country deserves it. We're making a lot of money. We're doing great as a country. We have no inflation. Record stock market. Record business. Record everything. Everything's a record now. We had the worst inflation in history under Biden and now we have almost no inflation. We've done a great job and we should have the interest rates cut.\n\nSpeaker 4 (45:13):\n\nSo you're saying the other day that Scott Bessent, you're so happy with him at Treasury, that he's not your top option to replace Jerome Powell, whenever that may be, whenever you decide what you want to do with him?\n\nPresident Trump (45:24):\n\nScott's doing a very good job now. I'm very happy with Scott. [inaudible 00:45:27]-\n\nSpeaker 4 (45:27):\n\nIs Kevin Hassett on the top of your list?\n\nPresident Trump (45:29):\n\nKevin's somebody we'd consider, yeah. Kevin is fantastic too. We have a lot of good people for that job. It's not a tough job, to be honest. Assuming you're smart, it's not a tough job. If you're dummy, then I guess it's a tough job. But it might be one of the easiest jobs I've ever seen. And now on top of it, he's building a close to $3 billion little nest egg for himself. He's not doing the right job. We should be saving a trillion dollars a year on interest when he talks about cost. We should be saving, think of it, a trillion dollars a year. Add that with the tariffs and everything else. But he just doesn't want… He's a knucklehead. But we'll see how… He's listening to this and going, that's a strange conversation. But we like to say it like it is.\n\n(46:20)But we have a lot of people that want that job very badly. And I'm only interested in low-interest people, frankly. Because you don't need… So they had the 71 different economists and people that, the experts that they picked about a month ago, I was the only one along with one person from maybe the Wharton School of Finance, the two of us got it right. 69 people, including Powell got it wrong. And he wants to hire thousands of new people to help him decide where we're going in the future. It only takes one good mind. It doesn't take 5,000 good minds. So they're expanding the Fed. It's the dumbest thing I've heard of, but you know, it's very autonomous.\n\nSpeaker 5 (47:06):\n\nJust a follow up on that, sir. Is [inaudible 00:47:11] are you completely ruling out the idea of firing Jerome Powell?\n\nPresident Trump (47:15):\n\nI don't rule out anything, but I think it's highly unlikely unless he has to leave fraud. I mean, it's possible. There's fraud involved with the 2.5, $2.7 billion renovation. It's a renovation, how do you spend $2.7 billion and he didn't have proper clearance, et cetera, et cetera. So you know that's going on. So there could be something to that. But I think he's not doing a good job. He's got a very easy job to do. You know what he has to do? Lower interest rates.\n\nSpeaker 6 (47:48):\n\n[inaudible 00:47:49] have you drafted a letter, Mr. President, [inaudible 00:47:52] decide that you are going to fire him. Have you drafted a letter?\n\nPresident Trump (47:53):\n\nNo, I haven't drafted a letter.\n\nSpeaker 6 (47:54):\n\nSo you didn't show a letter to Republican lawmakers last night?\n\nPresident Trump (47:58):\n\nNo. I talked about the concept of firing him. I said, what do you think? Almost every one of them said I should. But I'm more conservative than they are. We talked about it. In fact, we had 11 of the 12 people here yesterday for a very big bill having to do with crypto, et cetera, and other things. And all of the votes are going with us, every single vote. But during the conversation when we were talking about it, I asked, what would you do about that? They all said would fire him.\n\nSpeaker 7 (48:36):\n\nThank you for taking the question, sir. You were in Pennsylvania yesterday. You unveiled $92 billion worth of investments. One of those jumped out though $15 billion in Homer City to build the largest national gas power plant ever. I was at the rally where you told Homer City residents that you would not forget them when the biggest coal plant in Pennsylvania closed down. You delivered for them yesterday. What message do you have for those residents?\n\nPresident Trump (48:58):\n\nWell, I'm happy. Homer City, I was there and I said, I'm going to produce something. I don't know what, because they had shut down this massive coal plant, one of the biggest in the country, and it was just purchased by the gentleman that you met yesterday. A very substantial man. I don't know if he's as… Maybe not as substantial as you, I'm not sure. But he's pretty substantial. You know who I'm talking about. And they're going to spend billions of dollars on rebuilding it and it's going to be the largest plant of its kind in the world, I believe actually in the world. And it's going to be great. So we really fulfilled that promise to Homer City, but it's to Pennsylvania, basically. I won Pennsylvania and very conclusively won Pennsylvania, so I owe them a big debt of gratitude. But thank you for bringing that up.\n\n(49:50)We raised it's actually going over 100, so it'll be over $100 billion to be invested in Pennsylvania. It was Pennsylvania energy project. Everybody was there, Larry Fink was there. I mean everybody was there. And done a great job. The Senator did a great job. We were very proud. That was a great meeting yesterday. Thank you very much.\n\nSpeaker 8 (50:17):\n\n[inaudible 00:50:17] for each of you. So for the Crown Prince, are you planning on taking any of the Patriot missiles that you're going to receive from the United States and divert those to help Ukraine?\n\nCrown Prince (50:32):\n\nWe have no current plans as we have an operational requirement inside Bahrain to keep them there for the present time.\n\nPresident Trump (50:37):\n\nHe's got plenty of them too.\n\nSpeaker 8 (50:39):\n\nAnd Mr. President, the Fentanyl bill-\n\nCrown Prince (50:42):\n\nThey're wonderful. They're wonderful pieces of kit.\n\nPresident Trump (50:44):\n\nThey work very well.\n\nCrown Prince (50:45):\n\nAmerican technology is the best.\n\nPresident Trump (50:46):\n\nYep.\n\nSpeaker 8 (50:47):\n\nOn the Fentanyl bill that you're signing-\n\nPresident Trump (50:49):\n\nThat's maybe the most important part of this. This choice of everything. And we make the best military equipment by far in the world.\n\nCrown Prince (50:57):\n\nBar none.\n\nPresident Trump (50:58):\n\nThere's nothing close, right?\n\nCrown Prince (50:59):\n\nBar none.\n\nPresident Trump (00:00):\n\nPresident Trump (51:00):\n\nYeah, thank you.\n\nSpeaker 9 (51:01):\n\nNow on the fentanyl bill that you're signing today, do you hope that that's going to restart law enforcement cooperation with China on getting the fentanyl?\n\nPresident Trump (51:08):\n\nYeah, I think China has been helping out. It's been a terrible situation for many years with fentanyl, but since I came here, we're talking to them and they're making big steps. They're also, as you know, being penalized. You know that, right? They're being penalized with tariffs because of the fentanyl, but they want to do something. We'll see what happens.\n\nSpeaker 10 (51:33):\n\nMr. President, Mr. President.\n\nSpeaker 11 (51:33):\n\nMr. President. I know you're-\n\nSpeaker 12 (51:37):\n\nThank you, Mr. President. An American from Tampa was beaten to death. He was killed by Israeli settlers in the West Bank. His family has been calling on you to help prosecute his killers. Are you going to do that? An American from Tampa?\n\nPresident Trump (51:52):\n\nYeah. Your first sentence is really … Go ahead.\n\nSpeaker 12 (51:55):\n\nAn American citizen from Tampa, Florida, has been killed in the West Bank. His family has been asking you to prosecute him. Are you going to help find this guy?\n\nMarco Rubio (52:06):\n\nYeah. Well, so first of all, if you've seen yesterday, Ambassador Huckabee has asked the Israelis to conduct an investigation. We want to get all the information about who was involved. We protect all American citizens anywhere in the world, especially if they're unjustly murdered or killed. So we're gathering more information, but I hope you saw yesterday, Ambassador Huckabee in Israel asked the Israelis authorities to produce an investigation and concrete information about who was responsible for his murder.\n\nPresident Trump (52:30):\n\nThey're reporting that tomorrow. We have a meeting on it. They're going to be reporting that to me.\n\nSpeaker 12 (52:34):\n\nCan [inaudible 00:52:34]?\n\nPresident Trump (52:34):\n\nYeah.\n\nSpeaker 12 (52:36):\n\nDo you think that the Gulf area now is more secure and do you believe that a negotiation with Iran is necessary at this stage?\n\nCrown Prince (52:44):\n\nWell, I definitely believe that the volatility of the situation has been reduced and we didn't know where it was going to go on the Sunday. We were very glad when we found out on the Monday. Let me put it that way. And should the Iranians want to negotiate, I believe the ball is in the court. That is the true reality of where we stand today. They are the ones that stand to benefit from a negotiation.\n\nPresident Trump (53:09):\n\nAnd they do. They want negotiate. They want to negotiate badly. We're in no rush because we said we could have made a deal. They should have made a deal, and then we bombed the hell out of there, various places. We're in no rush. But if they want to negotiate, we're here. Yeah?\n\nSpeaker 6 (53:31):\n\nMr. President, Mr. President. I know you want to move past all this intrigue over the Epstein files, but I do want to ask you to clarify something you said this morning. You said this was all a hoax. Has your attorney general-\n\nPresident Trump (53:40):\n\nIt's a big hoax.\n\nSpeaker 6 (53:40):\n\n… told you this was a hoax? What evidence have you seen of that?\n\nPresident Trump (53:42):\n\nIt's not the attorney general. No, I know it's a hoax. It started by Democrats. It's been run by the Democrats for four years. You had Christopher Wray and these characters and Comey before him. And it's a bad group. It started actually … Look at the Steele dossier that turned out to be a total hoax. The 51 agents, the so-called intelligence agents. It was a hoax. It's all been a big hoax. It's perpetrated by the Democrats and some stupid Republicans and foolish Republicans fall into the net, and so they try and do the Democrat's work. The Democrats are good for nothing other than these hoaxes. They're bad for policy, they're bad for picking candidates that can get elected. Like in New York, we have a communist running. He may get elected too, actually. But he'll destroy the city. No, no. I call it the Epstein hoax.\n\n(54:34)Takes a lot of time and effort. Instead of talking about the great achievements we've had. A great gentleman, yesterday, as you know, went on CNBC and he made the statement that Trump may go down as the greatest president of all in the United States. And instead of talking about the things we've achieved. We've had tremendous achievement. They're wasting their time with a guy who obviously had some very serious problems who died three, four years ago. I'd rather talk about the success we have with the economy, the best we've ever had, and all of the things we've done, including the Middle East. You see it. Instead, they want to talk about the Epstein hoax. And the sad part is it's people that are really doing the Democrat's work. They're stupid people. Yeah, go ahead.\n\nSpeaker 19 (55:26):\n\nMr. President. There's lots of reports coming into this meeting that you planned on firing Fed Chair Jerome Powell. Market's reaction?\n\nPresident Trump (55:33):\n\nRight. Those are reports, but they're not true.\n\nSpeaker 19 (55:35):\n\nSo what would be useful to know, are you committed to picking someone from the outside. Are you going to interview individuals that are on the board?\n\nPresident Trump (55:41):\n\nSo many people that want that job. I have people that I've known a long time, they're calling me begging for the job. You know what you need there? A smart person with common sense. But you need a very smart person for that job. I think it's one of the easiest jobs in government. You show up once a month and you make a statement about where the economy is going, and we're going to raise or lower interest rates.\n\nSpeaker 19 (56:03):\n\nYou have to deliver a job though.\n\nPresident Trump (56:03):\n\nIt's probably the easiest job I've ever seen. That's why I'm trying to figure why does he want to expand and add more people. He's going to add more economists to tell him what to do. But the economists … I was right. All the economists were wrong. They admitted it this morning. Quiet, quiet, quiet. Go ahead.\n\nSpeaker 13 (56:23):\n\nYou mentioned fraud in an earlier answer. Are you saying you want to investigate the Fed Chair for fraud related to this renovation?\n\nPresident Trump (56:29):\n\nWell, I think he's already under investigation. He spent far more money than he was supposed to on rebuilding. I didn't see him as being the kind of guy that would want to have parks, rooftop parks and everything else on top of buildings. But who wants to spend that money for the Fed? The Fed is supposed to sit there and say where interest rates are going and a couple of other very easy things to do. And he spent two and a half billion dollars. I think he's got some problems.\n\nSpeaker 10 (57:01):\n\nMr. President, Mr. President.\n\nSpeaker 11 (57:01):\n\nMr. President.\n\nSpeaker 14 (57:02):\n\nThank you, sir. You also recorded a monthly surplus in the month of June.\n\nPresident Trump (57:06):\n\n25 billion dollars, 40 billion.\n\nSpeaker 14 (57:08):\n\nA ton of money. With these new tariff rates coming into effect on August 1st, be bringing in even more tariff revenue. Specifically, how much revenue do you think we can consistently bring in from these tariffs and how big of a game changer is this, not only for the economy, but also fiscal responsibility?\n\nPresident Trump (57:23):\n\nWell, we're going to be bringing in … Already we've brought in over a hundred billion dollars. We'll be bringing in hundreds of billions of dollars. And the tariffs really haven't kicked in that much other than automobiles and steel. August 1st is a big day. August 1st is when very substantial money comes into our country. We've made deals with a lot of great places, but we had one yesterday that was announced. We have another one coming up maybe with India. I don't know. We're in negotiation. When I send out a letter, that's a deal. In other words, that's a deal. They don't want to ever say that, \"Oh, how many deals have you made?\" The best deal we can make is to send out a letter and the letter says that you'll pay 30%, 35 percent, 25 percent, 20%. In one case, 50%. Brazil.\n\n(58:15)And because what they're doing to their former president is disgraceful. I know the former president. He fought like hell for the people of Brazil. That I can tell you. And I believe he's an honest man. I think what they're doing to him is terrible. So yeah, we have some pretty good deals to announce, but every time we send out a letter, that's the deal. The big one really is going to be on the 150 countries that we're really not negotiating with. And they're smaller. We don't do much business with them. Because you have a lot of countries. You have over 200 countries and a lot of people don't know this. But we'll have well over 150 countries that we're just going to send a notice of payment out and the notice of payment is going to say what the tariff … And it's all going to be the same for everyone for that group.\n\n(59:10)They're not big countries and they don't do that much business. It's not like the ones that we've agreed with, like China, like Japan, where we're negotiating with them. But I think probably we'll live by the letter with Japan. We're very close to a deal with India when they open it up. Indonesia yesterday was … It wasn't an open country. Now it is. And they have tremendous copper, quality copper, and probably the most copper. And we made a deal with Indonesia. We pay no tariff, zero, and we have total access to trade. That's a phenomenal deal for our companies. And we've agreed with them as you know, on 19%. They pay 19%. And it's a good deal for them, it's a good deal for us in that case. But we have a number of them coming up. But overall, we're doing well and we're taking in a lot of money, a lot of money. We have the number one … We have the most oil of any country in the world, even more than them, which is hard to believe. But we have a little larger piece of land.\n\nCrown Prince (01:00:16):\n\nYou do sir.\n\nPresident Trump (01:00:17):\n\nBut we're number one in the world in oil and we're drilling. And today it hit $64 a barrel, which is great. And that will help stop wars actually if you want to know the truth. It's going to help stop wars and we hope to get it down a little bit more. But we have oil down to $2, $2.25, $2.50 in numerous states. We hit one at a dollar 98 a gallon. And that's a great thing. That's one of the reasons that inflation is in check.\n\n(01:00:49)When you can do that, you stop inflation. What Biden did is he ended our policies, went to his policies. He didn't have a policy. Some lunatic around the desk had a policy. Whoever operated the auto pen had a policy, which is by the way, I think the biggest scandal. That's the scandal they should be talking about, not Jeffrey Epstein. The scandal you should be talking about is the auto pen because I think it's the biggest scandal, one of them in American history.\n\nSpeaker 10 (01:01:20):\n\nMr. President, Mr. President.\n\nPresident Trump (01:01:22):\n\nSo the economy is doing really well and people are seeing it. Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 11 (01:01:28):\n\nMr. President, Mr. President.\n\nSpeaker 15 (01:01:30):\n\nWill you ask Attorney General Pam Bondi to release more documents to finally put this controversy to bed?\n\nPresident Trump (01:01:35):\n\nYeah, whatever is credible, she can release. If a document is credible, if a document's there that is credible, she can release. I think it's good.\n\nSpeaker 15 (01:01:45):\n\nHave you talked to her about it?\n\nPresident Trump (01:01:47):\n\nBut it's just a subject. He's dead. He's gone. And all it is the Republicans. Certain Republicans got duped by the Democrats and they're following a Democrat playbook and no different than Russia, Russia, Russia and all the other hoaxes. They're started by the Democrats and some Republicans. In this case I was surprised. But they got duped.\n\nSpeaker 15 (01:02:17):\n\nHave you talked about it with her the last few days?\n\nSpeaker 16 (01:02:19):\n\nFirst of all, a number of your high-ranking officials, whether there's been your FBI director or Pam Bondi, they have made some inconsistent statements in the past. You've had-\n\nPresident Trump (01:02:28):\n\nWell, I don't know. I can't speak about him, but I can say that Pam Bondi, I really think that she's done very good. She says I gave you all the credible information, and if she finds any more credible information, she'll give that too. What more can she do than that? Honestly, what more can she do?\n\nSpeaker 16 (01:02:46):\n\nHave you talked about it?\n\nPresident Trump (01:02:47):\n\nAnd we do have bigger problems. We have problems with millions of illegal people that came in here and their killers and murderers. We have 11,888 murderers that were allowed into our country by Biden, sleepy Joe Biden, stupid Joe Biden. He allowed him into our country. And you know what? We got to do something about it. She's got a lot of things she's working on and it's very sad that somebody can just get waylaid, just get waylaid. But I think she's doing a great job.\n\nSpeaker 10 (01:03:16):\n\nMr. President, Mr. President.\n\nSpeaker 17 (01:03:21):\n\nIn your two sessions this morning, you mentioned past supporters when you were talking about the Epstein issue. Does that mean that you are effectively disowning any supporters who are now [inaudible 01:03:31]?\n\nPresident Trump (01:03:30):\n\nI lost a lot of faith in certain people. Yeah. Because they got duped by the Democrats. The Democrats are good for nothing. They've done a terrible job. They almost destroyed our country. If I didn't get elected, all these numbers you're hearing about, they found $25 billion and another 25 is coming in and hundreds of billions of dollars is pouring into our country. And we just got the biggest tax cut in history. We just got the biggest regulation cuts in history. There'll be no tax on tips. There'll be no tax on social security. There'll be no tax on overtime. There'll be no tax on so many other things. You're allowed to deduct your interest from a car payment. That's never happened before. You borrow interest. You borrow money to buy a car if the car is made in America. And by the way, factories are being built all over America, car factories, AI factories.\n\n(01:04:21)But you get a deduction on your interest. Nobody ever thought of that before. It never happened before. And these are the things that they should be talking about. The Big Beautiful Bill is one of the greatest pieces of legislation ever in this country. And the Democrats have nothing to combat it. So they say, \"Oh, it's death, death.\" Oh, that's good. And then they give it to the fake news, which is you and a few others. And the fake news talks about the bill is death. The bill is actually life. The bill is life and it saves our country. This bill is incredible. Look at the results already. So we have $16 trillion being invested in our country. And this great gentleman and his family just came in with another billions of dollars. And if he didn't like the country, if he didn't like where we were going … He's very smart.\n\n(01:05:14)He'd come, maybe he'd come, maybe he wouldn't even come. I think maybe you wouldn't even come. You would save your time. But it's one of those things. But if he didn't like where this country was, he wouldn't be investing billions of dollars in this country. But think of it, $16 trillion more than has ever been even contemplated before. And we haven't even started yet. So that's what I want to talk about. I want to talk about the success. And the Democrats have nothing to show for what they do. They almost destroyed. They allowed 25 million people to come into our country. Gang members, jailbirds from all over the world, not South America, from all over the world. They allowed them to come into our country from mental institutions and insane asylums. Just walk right through. They couldn't come into your country. They couldn't come into any country in the world except our country.\n\n(01:06:07)And they came in from the worst places, gang members, drug dealers, they all came in … Turn it off, please. They all came in. And I'm doing something about it. We have it under check right now. We got rid of a lot of the murderers already. Some of them we put in our prisons because they are so bad we don't want to take a chance in putting them in a foreign prison and ave them come back. But we've done a great job. Our country is in great shape. We literally have the hottest country anywhere in the world right now. And it's true what the king said, what a lot of people said. We were a dead country. One year ago, we were a dead country. We were laughed at all over the world. We had Afghanistan. We've had horrible embarrassment, most embarrassing moment in the history of our country.\n\n(01:07:01)Look what happened with Russia and Ukraine. That should have never happened. Look what happened with Israel. That would've never happened. Hamas had no money. Iran had no money. There was no money to do an attack like that. All these things that happened that wouldn't have happened if you had good leadership. And that's what you should be talking about. Thank you very much.\n\n(01:07:19)Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 14 (01:07:29):\n\nLet's go. Let's go. Thank you. Thank you press. Thank you. Thank you. Roll on guys. Thank you press.\n\nPresident Trump (01:07:45):\n\nAnother day in paradise.\n\nSpeaker 18 (01:07:45):\n\nThank you, Mr. President.\n\nPresident Trump (01:07:45):\n\nThank you, Bernie.\n\nSpeaker 21 (01:07:45):\n\nThank you, sir.\n\nSpeaker 20 (01:07:45):\n\nThank you.",

    "title": "Trump Meets with NATO Secretary-General",
    "date": "",
    "transcript": "President Donald Trump (09:13):\n\nOkay. Thank you very much. It's a honor, great honor to have a friend of mine who have become very friendly over the last number of years. We knew each other before, but Mark is the head of NATO, Mark Rutte, Secretary General of NATO. Highly respected by everybody that knows him, but in particular the European countries have great reliance on him and he's done a fantastic job, and we had a tremendous meeting. I guess it's about a month now, a month ago, and I think Mark will tell you that it was really perhaps more important the date of November 5th. That was the election day. Maybe that was the most important because we've made tremendous progress together. And one of the reasons that you're here today is to hear that we are very unhappy, I am, with Russia, but we'll discuss that maybe a different day, but we're very, very unhappy with them, and we're going to be doing very severe tariffs if we don't have a deal in 50 days.\n\n(10:17)Tariffs at about a hundred percent. You'd call them secondary tariffs. You know what that means. But today we're going to talk about something else, and as you know we've spent $350 billion approximately on this war with Russia and Ukraine, and would like to see it end. It wasn't my war, it was Biden's war. It's not my war. I'm trying to get you out of it, and we want to see it end. And I'm disappointed in President Putin because I thought we would've had a deal two months ago, but it doesn't seem to get there. So based on that, we're going to be doing secondary tariffs if we don't have a deal in 50 days. It's very simple, and they'll be at a hundred percent. And that's the way it is. It can be more simple but it's just the way it is.\n\n(11:03)I hope we don't have to do it. But regardless, we are going to be… We make the greatest military equipment in the world, whether it's missiles. You saw that recently in Iran, the way those planes flew in, they had every single… 14 bombs hit every target. Then you had the helicopters shoot a total of 30 bombs, 30 missiles, and they hit every single marker. Is that right? Every single piece. Every single target. And it was, I guess on a scale of zero to 10, they say it was about a 15. That's how successful it was. That's how lethal it was. A word they like to use nowadays. But it was an amazing, well-organized attack that people in this country wanted to do for 24 years. When we had the pilots in last week, they were saying, \"Sir, we've been practicing this for\n\nPresident Donald Trump (12:00):\n\n… 24 years, meeting people, not them, but other people that are a little older now. But they too, and you were the one that let us do it. But we've been practicing it three to four times a year for 22, 24 years, because they always knew they had to stop Iran from doing what they were doing, which is trying to come up with a nuclear weapon, a nuclear bomb.\n\n(12:26)And we did it very successfully, and we make the best equipment, the best missiles, the best of everything. The European nations know that, and we've made a deal today, and I'm going to have Mark speak about it. But we've made a deal today, where we are going to be sending them weapons, and they're going to be paying for them. The United States will not be having any payment made. We are not buying it, but we will manufacture it, and they're going to be paying for it.\n\n(12:59)Our last meeting of a month ago was very successful, in that they agreed to five percent, which is more than a trillion dollars a year, so they have a lot of money, and these are wealthy nations. They have a lot of money, and they want to do it. They feel very strongly about it, and we feel strongly about it too. But we're in for a lot of money, and we don't want to do any more, and we can't.\n\n(13:19)But we make the best, and we're going to be sending the best to NATO, and in some cases, to maybe, at Mark's suggestion, if we go to Germany, where they're going to send early on missiles. And they'll be replaced, and NATO is going to take care of it. It's going to be coordinated by NATO, and they're going to work very much with Matt Whitaker, who's right here, who is a great ambassador. And Matt's going to be coordinating. You better do a good job, Matt.\n\nMatt Whitaker (13:44):\n\nI will.\n\nPresident Donald Trump (13:44):\n\nBut Matt's going to coordinate. He's a very talented guy. He's going to coordinate everything.\n\n(13:49)So in a nutshell, we're going to make top-of-the-line weapons, and they'll be sent to NATO. NATO may choose to have certain of them sent to other countries where we can get a little additional speed, where the country will release something, and it'll be mostly in the form of a replacement. And I'd like to have Mark, and again, just a highly respected, pretty young guy. Pretty young guy for having had the career that he's had, because he had an amazing career before going to NATO. And we spent a lot of time together over the last couple of months.\n\n(14:25)And if you could say a few words?\n\nMark Rutte (14:26):\n\nAbsolutely. No, no, Mr. President, dear Donald, this is really big. This is really big. You called me on Thursday, that you had taken a decision, and the decision is that you want Ukraine what it needs to have to maintain, to be able to defend itself against Russia. But you want Europeans to pay for it, which is totally logical. And this is building on the tremendous success of the NATO summit, the five percent, but also the decision to keep Ukraine strong and the decision to increase our defense industrial production.\n\n(15:02)So based on that, that was Europe stepping up. This is again, Europeans stepping up. So I've been in contact with many countries. I can tell you that this moment, Germany, massively, but also Finland and Denmark and Sweden and Norway, United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Canada, they all want to be part of this. And this is only the first wave; there will be more.\n\n(15:22)So what we will do is work through the NATO systems to make sure that we know what Ukrainians need, so if we can make packages. Of course, in a way, we discussed it this morning with Pete Hegseth at the Pentagon, in a way that of course, the US will keep on its stockpiles necessary to defend this country. That's absolutely clear. But it will mean that Ukraine can get its hands on really massive numbers of military equipment, both for air defense, but also missiles, ammunition, et cetera, et cetera.\n\n(15:54)So if I was Vladimir Putin today, and you're speaking about what you were planning to do in 50 days, and this announcement, I would reconsider whether I should not take negotiations about Ukraine more seriously than I was doing at the moment, if I was Vladimir Putin. But when on Ukraine, I think this is really great news for that, so I really want to thank you for that. That means Europeans paying for it, and again, I mentioned all these countries. We will deal with that. And exactly as you said, it might also mean that countries will move equipment fast into Ukraine, and then the US later backfilling it, because speed is of the essence here. So really, thank you.\n\n(16:33)This is important.\n\nPresident Donald Trump (16:35):\n\nThank you. You did a great job. It's a really great job. We've been very successful in settling wars. You have India, Pakistan. You have Rwanda and the Congo. That was going on for 30 years. India, by the way, and Pakistan would have been a nuclear war within another week, the way that was going. That was going very badly. And we did that through trade. I said, \"We're not going to talk to you about trade unless you get this thing settled,\" and they did. And they were both great, great leaders, and they were great. But Rwanda and the Congo, that was going on for 30 years, and at least seven million people killed and killed with a lot of pretty rough weapons like machetes, heads chopped off. Going on for many years. You couldn't even get near the countries. Nobody wanted to get near; it's so frightening. And we got that one solved.\n\n(17:25)Serbia, Kosovo, got that solved. That was going to be one that was going to happen. And again, that was something I used. I use trade for a lot of things, but it's great for settling wars. That was really very important. We're working. Marco is working very hard with everybody here.\n\n(17:42)And the Strip, the Gaza Strip. I call it the Gaza Strip, one of the worst real estate deals ever made. They gave up the oceanfront property, one of the worst deals ever made. But it was supposed to bring peace, and it didn't bring peace; it brought the opposite. But we're doing pretty well on Gaza. Steve Witkoff is here, and I think we could have something fairly soon to talk about.\n\n(18:08)And we solved other one, one that we just seemed to have: Armenia and Azerbaijan. It looks like that's going to come to a conclusion, a successful conclusion. We worked on Egypt with a next-door neighbor who is a good neighbor. They're friends of mine, but they happened to build a dam, which closed up water going into a thing called the Nile. I think if I'm Egypt, I want to have water in the Nile, and we're working on that one. It's a problem, but it's going to get solved. They built one of the biggest dams in the world, a little bit outside of Egypt. You know about that; you've been hearing about that one.\n\nMark Rutte (18:51):\n\nYes.\n\nPresident Donald Trump (18:51):\n\nAnd that turned out to be a big problem. I don't know. I think The United States funded the dam. I don't know why they didn't solve the problem before they built the dam, but it's nice when the Nile River has water. It's a very important source of income and life. It's the life of Egypt, and to take that away is pretty incredible, but we think we're going to have that solved very quickly. So we do good.\n\n(19:15)The only one we haven't been able to get to yet is Russia, and I'm not happy, and I will tell you that Ukraine wants to do something. Again, it's a war that should have never started. If I were president, it never would have happened. I used to speak to President Putin about it a lot. It was the apple of his eye. But once I saw what was going on, I said, \"You know, they're going to have a war here.\" I was outside. Election was rigged, and I was outside looking in, and I said, \"You know, that thing's going to be a war.\" Couldn't believe it, because what Biden said was the exact opposite of what should have been said. And it started, and it's a real mess. We're losing. I guess they're losing 5,000 or 6,000 people a day. It's actually now more. I was saying 5, 000 a day; it's actually more now, mostly soldiers, but a lot of people in cities and towns that are getting blown up too. It's a horrible war, and it should be stopped.\n\n(20:09)And so if it's not done, if we don't have an agreement in 50 days, that's what we're doing: secondary tariffs. And they're biting, and I hope we don't get to the point where we do, but I've been hearing so much talk. It's all talk. It's all talk, and then missiles go into Kiev and kill 60 people. It's got to stop. It's got to stop.\n\n(20:33)But the purpose of this is to say that this is a very big deal we've made. This is billions of dollars worth of military equipment is going to be purchased from The United States, going to NATO, et cetera. And that's going to be quickly distributed to the battlefield. Ukraine will take it up. And say what you want about Ukraine. When the war started, they had no chance, and they still would have had no chance if the equipment they used. They had the best equipment because we do make the best planes and missiles, and we make the best military equipment in the world by far. We have new things coming out that are beyond belief, and I'm very excited about the Golden Dome. It's going to give us very strong protection where we've already started that.\n\n(21:22)But they had courage because somebody has to use that equipment, and they fought with tremendous courage, and they continue to fight with tremendous courage. But they don't have … They're losing on equipment, and Russia has really taken a very positive, very, very strong … I mean, what they've done the last couple of weeks …\n\nMark Rutte (21:43):\n\nWithout military reasons. So what they are doing, several hundred drones a day, missiles, bombing cities, this is not because of military goals. It is just creating panic.\n\nPresident Donald Trump (21:53):\n\nThey're hitting towns.\n\nMark Rutte (21:53):\n\nHitting people out of their sleep, hitting towns. It's really terrible, and it is meaning a lot of people lose their lives, but also the infrastructure, the whole cities being destroyed.\n\nPresident Donald Trump (22:04):\n\nThey're wiping out the electric; it's going to take years to rebuild it. That's going to be the next problem, but that's going to take a long time. Cities, many of the cities are knocked down to the ground. Many of the people have left, but many have stayed. I don't know. They actually stay. Most have stayed, actually. It's incredible that they stay, knowing that a missile could be hitting your apartment house, and your apartment house that you're sitting in could collapse on top of you. And they do very heavy construction. They don't use rebar; they do very thick concrete construction. Those are heavy buildings, big buildings and heavy buildings, and they collapse like they're made out of paper. It's unbelievable to see this happening with people, so many people being killed.\n\n(22:47)So we think we're going to make progress, and we hope we're going to make progress. In the meantime, we're going to get you good service on what you need. And then we really became friendly with NATO this last meeting. We went from two percent to five percent, which everyone said was not even a possibility. They weren't paying two percent. Many of them were paying much less than two percent.\n\nMark Rutte (23:07):\n\nBut even those, since you became president, all committed to the two percent before the summit, and now collectively, we committed to the five percent.\n\nPresident Donald Trump (23:13):\n\nThat's right; they did. And they've been very good, and I think they made a lot of friends over there. We had a couple of days of very intensive talks, and they're great people. They're leaders of countries, leaders of countries, many of them great countries, some of them smaller countries. But for the most part, that's some very solid, strong countries, and very successful. Some of them are among the most successful countries in the world.\n\n(23:38)So that's the story. We hope that's going to have an impact on Vladimir Putin, and we hope it's going to have an impact on Ukraine also. We want to make sure that Ukraine does what they have to do. All of a sudden, they may feel emboldened, and maybe they don't want … This is a very difficult situation.\n\nMark Rutte (23:58):\n\nUkraine wants a peace deal.\n\nPresident Donald Trump (00:00):\n\nPresident Donald Trump (24:00):\n\nI think so.\n\nMark Rutte (24:00):\n\nThey will stay committed to that. There's no doubt they want it to, but the Russians have to become-\n\nPresident Donald Trump (24:04):\n\nThey have to continue to want it though.\n\nMark Rutte (24:05):\n\nYeah, I agree. You and I'll make sure of that.\n\nPresident Donald Trump (24:08):\n\nAll of a sudden they get you-\n\nMark Rutte (24:09):\n\nYou and I'll make sure of that.\n\nPresident Donald Trump (24:10):\n\nWe'll make sure. I feel confident that they will do what has to be done. Plus we have certain parameters that both sides know, and we already know what should be done. So I think that's going to be very strong. We want everlasting piece. Any questions, france? Yes.\n\nSpeaker 1 (24:27):\n\nThank you Mr. President, what was the tipping point for you in making this decision? Was it a conversation with President Putin? Was it a piece of intelligence and why are you giving 50 more days?\n\nPresident Donald Trump (24:36):\n\nI think the… Well, I think it's a very short period of time. I think, don't forget, I've just really been involved in this for not very long and it wasn't initial focus. This is, again, this is a Biden war. This is a Democrat war, not a Republican or Trump war. This is a war that would've never happened. It shouldn't have happened. A lot of people being killed.\n\n(24:56)When the final numbers come in, you're going to see a lot more people are being killed in this war than you think, than you've been writing about. It's a very deadly war. Very. They're all bad, but this is a very deadly war. Very. The numbers are going to be far greater.\n\n(25:12)An apartment house comes down and they say two people were slightly injured. No. Many people were killed. And those numbers will be at some point accurately reported. So far they're not. It's a deadly war. I think that you're just going to see, I think you're going to see strong movement. I hope so. I hope so.\n\nSpeaker 1 (25:31):\n\nWhat about-\n\nPresident Donald Trump (25:33):\n\nYou know, the secondary tariffs are very, very powerful.\n\nSpeaker 1 (25:36):\n\nWhat about the tariffs that the Republicans in the House and the Senate have ready? Those were 500%. Why are you doing 100%?\n\nPresident Donald Trump (25:43):\n\nWell, the Republicans are moving very strongly in the Senate giving us total control of it, but I'm not sure we need it. But it's certainly good that they're doing it. And Lindsey Graham is working hard. The whole… John Thune, all of them, all working hard and they're in coordination with Mike Johnson, Speaker in the House.\n\n(26:06)And I think they are… They've actually crafted a pretty good piece of legislation is probably going to pass very easily. And that includes Democrats and there's some little tweaks. But I don't want to say I don't need it because I don't want them to waste their time. It could be very useful. We'll have to see. But we can do secondary, we're probably talking about a hundred percent or something like that.\n\nSpeaker 1 (26:30):\n\nCan you do [inaudible 00:26:30]-\n\nPresident Donald Trump (26:30):\n\nWe can do secondary… We can do secondary tariffs without the Senate, without the House. But what they're crafting also could be very good.\n\nSpeaker 1 (26:39):\n\nSo are you suggesting then that the Congress should move forward with those sanctions? The 500% and that your 100 would be a separate additional package?\n\nPresident Donald Trump (26:47):\n\nYeah, I mean the 500 is sort of meaningless after a while, because at a certain point it doesn't matter. It's not going to be, a hundred is going to serve the same function. But yeah, I have it at a hundred percent. They may have it. I don't know what they're going to end up with. They may have it at 102, they may have it at 500.\n\n(27:08)But they're doing some good work in the House and I think in the House and the Senate. And as you know, they're coordinated and they can have it done quickly. They said they'll have it as quickly as I need it. So we'll see. We're talking to him. In fact, John Thune is coming over later on to talk. Yeah, he's going to come over talk.\n\nSpeaker 2 (27:26):\n\nThank you. Mr. President. Is it your view that Vladimir Putin mischaracterized his dedication to-\n\nPresident Donald Trump (27:31):\n\nWhat?\n\nSpeaker 2 (27:32):\n\nIs it your view that Vladimir Putin misguided… Did not clarify his intention to a peace deal? And what happens now in the next phase? Is there-\n\nPresident Donald Trump (27:47):\n\nWe're going to see, we're going to go for a period of time. Maybe you'll start negotiating. I think we felt, I felt, I don't know about you, Mark, but I felt that we had a deal about four times. And here we are still talking about…\n\nMark Rutte (28:01):\n\nHe didn't send serious people to the negotiations. So I remember that you were able, with Marco Rubio and with Steve Witkoff to get his stores going in Istanbul. I remember I was myself in Turkey for NATO business in May, and we really put pressure on the Ukrainians to send a senior team to Istanbul and they did. But then, the Russians came up with this historian explaining history of Russia since 1250.\n\nPresident Donald Trump (28:28):\n\nWe thought, and I thought we should have had a deal done a long time ago. But it just keeps going on and on and on. And every night people are dying. A lot of people, a lot of Russian soldiers are dying, by the way. And a lot of Ukrainian soldiers too. But a Russian soldiers are dying.\n\nMark Rutte (28:47):\n\nA hundred thousand Russian soldiers since first or January. Since January. A hundred thousand Russian soldiers dead since January. So if anybody in Moscow listening to this, again, a hundred thousand dead Russians since January, this is what President Putin is doing at the moment.\n\nPresident Donald Trump (29:04):\n\nYeah, please.\n\nSpeaker 1 (29:06):\n\nWill these be Patriot missiles specifically or Patriot batteries that you're planning? When do you-\n\nPresident Donald Trump (29:10):\n\nIt's everything. It's Patriots. It's all of them. It's a full complement with the batteries.\n\nSpeaker 1 (29:15):\n\nAnd when do you expect them to arrive in Ukraine, sir?\n\nPresident Donald Trump (29:18):\n\nWell, we're going to have some come very soon. Within days, actually. A couple of the countries that have Patriots are going to swap over and we'll replace the Patriots with the ones they have. And Matt will coordinate with NATO. But so it's going to be, they're start arriving very soon.\n\nMark Rutte (29:35):\n\nAnd this afternoon Boris Pistorius, the German defense minister is visiting Pete Hegseth, the Secretary of Defense. And we'll discuss also, I think on this whole Patriot thing. Norway is involved. So that's on the Patriots. But this whole deal is also about missiles or ammunition. So it's a broader than Patriots.\n\nPresident Donald Trump (29:52):\n\nWe have one country that has 17 Patriots getting ready to be shipped. They're not going to need them for them for that. So we're going to work a deal where the 17 will go or a big portion of the 17 will go to the war site.\n\nAudience (30:05):\n\nMr. President, Mr. President.\n\nPresident Donald Trump (30:06):\n\nThat could be done very quickly.\n\nSpeaker 3 (30:07):\n\nMr. President.\n\nPresident Donald Trump (30:09):\n\nYeah. Please.\n\nSpeaker 3 (30:10):\n\nCould this transaction with NATO be viewed as a step towards achieving peace, letting Putin know that now Zelensky has a little bit more powerful tools in his tool chest and maybe that brings him to the table to achieve peace. I know that you wanted to do that.\n\nPresident Donald Trump (30:26):\n\nBrian, that's what we've been saying. I think you might've expressed it better if you want.\n\nSpeaker 3 (30:31):\n\nI just want exactly a summary. That was a nice summary.\n\nPresident Donald Trump (30:34):\n\nI think he said better than us. He's a very good guy. I can tell you that. But no, it's well said. Yeah. I think this is a chance at getting peace or it's just going to be the same thing.\n\n(30:48)I have to tell you, Europe has a lot of spirit for this war. A lot of people, when I first got involved, I really didn't think they did, but they do. And I saw that a month ago. And then you were there. Most of you, many of you were there. The level of esprit de corps, spirit that they have is amazing. They really think it's a very, very important thing to do or they wouldn't be doing.\n\n(31:15)Look, they're agreeing to just so they're paying for everything. We're not paying anymore. We have an ocean separating us. I said, we have a problem. We make the best stuff, but we can't keep doing this. And Biden should have done this years ago. He should have done it from the beginning, but he didn't. He didn't know he was there. This guy, what a horrible job they did for this country. And I just hope between the border and this and so many other… Inflation, what a horrible administration. The worst administration in history. In my opinion. That's not my opinion. I think it's everybody's opinion.\n\n(31:49)But this is something that shouldn't have happened. And we're going to see if we can end it.\n\nSpeaker 3 (31:54):\n\nIf I just follow up.\n\nPresident Donald Trump (31:55):\n\nI do want to make one statement again. I said it before, this is not Trump's war. We are here to try and get it finished and settled and whatever, because nobody wins with this. This is a loser from every standpoint\n\nMark Rutte (32:09):\n\nFrom day one.\n\nPresident Donald Trump (32:10):\n\nThis was Biden and this was other people. And it's very sad. It's a very sad situation. This gentleman's doing a great job. He's going to… I think he's going to get it. And Matt and everybody else that's working on it, I think you'll get this thing over with.\n\nSpeaker 4 (32:27):\n\nYou've praised European countries today as standing up for Ukraine as being strong. Will you allow them to continue to negotiate tariffs lower than 30% before August 1st? Or is the deal set at this point?\n\nPresident Donald Trump (32:38):\n\nWhat does that mean? You mean you're talking about the tariffs?\n\nSpeaker 4 (32:39):\n\nOn trade, on tariffs.\n\nPresident Donald Trump (32:42):\n\nYou're back on tariffs. They're more friendly tariff, right? A little bit more friendly tariff. No, we're going to be talking to people. We have, I want you to show this one, they were talking about, well, when's he going to make the deal? The deals are already made. The letters are the deals. The deals are made. There are no deals to make. They would like to do a different kind of a deal. And we're always open to talk. We are open to talk, including to Europe. In fact, they're coming over. They'd like to talk.\n\nSpeaker 1 (33:10):\n\nMr. President. Is there any concern about the U.S. stockpiles? There was a pause in delivery of weaponry to Ukraine in order to evaluate apparently the U.S. stockpiles. What came out of that?\n\nPresident Donald Trump (33:22):\n\nEvaluation. I mean, this was a very big, what we're talking about today is a very, very big day. And what Pete was doing, and me too. I knew what Pete was doing, was evaluation because we knew this was going to happen and now we actually announced it. They voted on it's all been done.\n\n(33:43)So obviously that has a big impact on, when you say pause, obviously you're not going to be doing things if you don't know what's going to happen here. But we were pretty sure this was going to happen. So we did a little bit of a pause. But this is a very big, is a very big event today. This is something great.\n\nSpeaker 5 (33:59):\n\nMr. President, if Putin Escalates further, how far are you willing to go in response?\n\nPresident Donald Trump (34:04):\n\nIn what?\n\nSpeaker 5 (34:05):\n\nHow far are you willing to go if Putin were to escalate, send more bombs in the coming days?\n\nPresident Donald Trump (34:10):\n\nDon't ask me a question like that. How far I want to get the war settled. They're not Americans that are dying in it. And I have a problem and JD has a problem. It's a stance that he's had for a long time. They're not Americans dying, but there are a lot of people dying and on something that should be able to be settled. And we all agree with that, this group of people that we want to defend our country. But ultimately, having a strong Europe is a very good thing. It's a very good thing. So I'm okay with that. Yeah, please. In the back.\n\nSpeaker 6 (34:42):\n\nYeah. Is there a ceiling on what the Europeans are willing to pay for? And it sounds like, are you ruling out the U.S. some additional weapons through draw down authority?\n\nMark Rutte (34:50):\n\nShall I try to answer that please? Because basically what the President is saying that he's willing -- of course taking consideration what the U.S. needs itself. So it's not that you can have a shopping list, you can order whatever you want because the U.S. has to make sure that the U.S. keeps his hands on what the U.S. needs also, to keep the whole world safe because in the end, you are the police agent of the whole world. You're the most powerful nation on earth, most powerful military on earth.\n\n(35:14)But given that, the U.S. has decided to indeed supply Ukraine with what is necessary through NATO, Europeans a hundred percent paying for that. And what we have been doing over the last couple of days is talking with countries and I just mentioned to ones, who in the first wave immediately said, we want to chip in. And then you are really talking about big numbers. Take Germany, visiting today, they're really talking about big numbers.\n\nSpeaker 7 (35:41):\n\nCan we get some clarity-\n\nPresident Donald Trump (35:41):\n\nI'll say that I spoke with Germany, spoke with most of the larger countries and they are really enthusiastic about this. They want to… And they're willing to go very far. I will tell you as per your question, how far would I go? They want to go very far. They don't want this to happen.\n\nPresident Donald Trump (36:00):\n\nThat's why I think from Putin's standpoint, it would really be good. He gets, the country's economy is doing very poorly and he's got to get his economy back. He's got to save his economy. He could save his country in a sense, but the economy can destroy. Destroyed a lot of countries over the years. He wants to get that economy back. And yeah, he is got a great country for trading and other things, if they could use the assets instead of war. He's got some tremendous potential. That's what I would say.\n\nSpeaker 8 (36:28):\n\nHow did you deliver this news to Putin, sir?\n\nPresident Donald Trump (36:29):\n\nSay it?\n\nSpeaker 8 (36:29):\n\nHow did you tell Putin this was coming?\n\nPresident Donald Trump (36:32):\n\nI speak to him a lot about getting this thing done. And I always hang up and say, \"Well, that was a nice phone call.\" And then missiles launched into Kiev or some other city. And I said, \"It's strange.\" And after that happens three or four times, you say the talk doesn't mean anything. My conversations with him are always very pleasant. And I say, \"Isn't that very lovely conversation?\" And then the missiles go off that night.\n\n(36:59)I go home, I tell the first lady, \"You know, I spoke to Vladimir today, we had a wonderful conversation.\" She said, \"Oh, really? Another city was just hit.\" So it's like, look he's, I don't want to say he's an assassin, but he's a tough guy. It's been proven over the years. He's fooled a lot of people. He fooled Bush, he fooled a lot of people. He fooled Clinton, Bush, Obama, Biden. He didn't fool me. But what I do say is that at a certain point, ultimately talk doesn't talk, it's got to be action. There's got to be results. And I hope he does it. It's potentially such a great country to be wasting so many people on this, and the money. And look at what's happened to his economy, look at what's happened.\n\nMark Rutte (37:51):\n\nAnd was a threat in 50 days.\n\nPresident Donald Trump (37:52):\n\nYeah.\n\nMark Rutte (37:52):\n\nAnd we will be hit very hard.\n\nSpeaker 10 (37:53):\n\nThe first lady told you-\n\nPresident Donald Trump (37:56):\n\nI mean, look, I hope he's going to do it. He knows the deal. He knows what a fair deal is. If there is such a thing as a fair deal. There's no winners here. This is a loser. There's a loser. And I dealt with him from the beginning and it wouldn't have happened. But I will say, Ukraine was the apple of his eye. We talk about it. It was the apple of his eye. But it wasn't going to happen. And he understood that. It wasn't going to happen.\n\n(38:23)And then I noticed after I was out, I noticed soldiers forming at the border.\n\nMark Rutte (38:28):\n\nYeah.\n\nPresident Donald Trump (38:28):\n\nAnd then I heard horrible stupid things being said from the other side. And I said, \"They're really handling it very, very wrong.\" It's a shame. Yeah.\n\nMark Rutte (38:39):\n\nCan I say-\n\nSpeaker 8 (38:39):\n\nWhy did you-\n\nMark Rutte (38:40):\n\n… one thing? And it is about President Trump, because you came to office in January, the 12th of February, you had your first phone call with Putin. I think you did exactly what I hoped you would do, that is breaking the deadlock. Started the conversation because you have to test him. I know Putin very well from the days when I was Prime Minister and learned once you have to test it. And you did this. And you really gave him a chance to be serious, to get to the table to start negotiations, Steve Witkoff, Marco Rubio, we're all try to help you. But you've now come to a point where you're saying, \"Well, hey.\"\n\nPresident Donald Trump (39:08):\n\nWe actually thought we had probably four times the deal.\n\nMark Rutte (39:12):\n\nYeah.\n\nPresident Donald Trump (39:12):\n\nI mean, you would've called and would have said-\n\nMark Rutte (39:13):\n\nYeah.\n\nPresident Donald Trump (39:14):\n\n… \"This looks good.\"\n\nMark Rutte (39:15):\n\nYeah.\n\nPresident Donald Trump (39:15):\n\nAnd then the deal wouldn't happen because bombs would be thrown out that night, and you'd say, \"We're not making any deals.\" It was like, strange.\n\nMark Rutte (39:22):\n\nBut you waiting the [inaudible 00:39:23] was crucial, because you had to start that process, and you were the only one who was able to do that.\n\nPresident Donald Trump (39:28):\n\nI think we'll get it done.\n\nSpeaker 8 (39:29):\n\nDo you think he's reasonable enough to negotiate an end to this?\n\nPresident Donald Trump (39:33):\n\nI think we're going to get it done. I think, look, this is a very powerful situation. You have very wealthy countries buying the best equipment in the world, and we have the best equipment in the world. We make equipment like no other. Our submarines, nuclear submarines are so powerful. They're the most powerful weapon ever built. And we have the best in the world by, they're 20 years behind, 25 years behind us. We have the greatest equipment anywhere in the world. I just hope we don't have to use it. Yeah, please.\n\nSpeaker 9 (40:07):\n\nThank you, Mr. President. On a separate topic here, President Biden, of all people, spoke to the New York Times over the weekend. He did not speak to them on the record during his time in office at all, but he spoke to them recently. And he defended his use of the autopen and said that he signed off on every decision. But at the same time, the Times reports that he did not individually approve each name for the categorical part of this that applied to large numbers of people. What is your take on that? Any new revelations from that?\n\nPresident Donald Trump (40:37):\n\nWell, I mean, you're talking about the autopen. Look, the autopen, I think, is maybe one of the biggest scandals that we've had in 50 to 100 years. This is a tremendous scandal. And I know the people on the other side of the… Oh, see that desk, that Resolute desk, unfortunately he used it before me. But you know we have our choice of seven desks. They're all beautiful. But I chose the Resolute and so did he, unfortunately. But the people on the other side of the Resolute desk, I know them. Lisa, the whole group, and they're no good. They're sick people. And I guarantee you he knew nothing about what he was signing. I guarantee it.\n\n(41:23)So they're going to figure it out and we'll see what happens. But to me, the autopen, you elect a president, you know what the autopen is supposed to do? Sign thousands of letters from young people that write. I get, we get thousands of letters a week, Susie, right? Thousands. I mean, tens of thousands sometimes. I look at a room. There's a room where we have many, many people working, responding and sending letters back. That's what an autopen supposed to be, to write to a young seven-year-old boy that writes to the president and he wants to be president someday. And he loves America. That's what the autopen is supposed to be. It's not supposed to be for signing major legislation and all other things. No, the autopen…\n\n(42:08)And I doubt he knew. I doubt they even spoke to him about it. I think they had, it's called the freewheeling autopen. Like Biden was never for open borders. Biden was never for transgender for everyone. So I don't think he, I think the radical left people that took, they took over the White House, and if I didn't win, our country was finished.\n\n(42:32)You know, when I was in, and I said this a couple of times, I hope I don't bore you with it. But when I was in Saudi Arabia, I was in Qatar, I was in UAE. And then I met with all of your leaders.\n\nMark Rutte (42:42):\n\nYes, sir.\n\nPresident Donald Trump (42:43):\n\nIncluding you, a great leader. He's now the leader of many countries, not just-\n\nMark Rutte (42:47):\n\nNo, no, no, no.\n\nPresident Donald Trump (42:49):\n\nBut I met with a lot of leaders over the last two months in the Middle East and all of the NATO, all of the NATO countries.\n\nMark Rutte (42:59):\n\nYes.\n\nPresident Donald Trump (42:59):\n\nAnd I will tell you, they had one common phrase. They thought America was dead one year ago. And today they say, and they all say it, and I hope you'll back me up at this. But they say, now it's the hottest country anywhere in the world. It is. Look at our numbers. Look at the numbers we made. You see, we made 25 billion last month. We didn't make that for years.\n\n(43:22)The tariffs are kicking in. The economy's very strong. Even though we have a Fed person who's terrible. He doesn't know what the hell he's doing, but that's all right. We blow through interest rates. We're doing so well, we blow through it. It'd be nice, because people would be able to buy housing a lot easier.\n\n(43:37)But think of it, \"We thought your country was dead.\" And they were dealing with China, because they were really going to China, but not anymore. But, \"We thought your country was dead and now you have the hottest country anywhere in the world.\" So we've done a really good job. And it's an honor to have this man. This man is a star. And he's going to be dealing with another one of my stars, Matt. And you're going to do a great job, Matt Whitaker. Okay?\n\nMatt Whitaker (44:04):\n\nI will.\n\nPresident Donald Trump (44:05):\n\nYou very much, everybody.\n\nSpeaker 11 (44:10):\n\nThank you, press. Press, I think you got, you're good.\n\nPresident Donald Trump (44:10):\n\nThank you.\n\nSpeaker 11 (44:10):\n\nThank you.",

    "date": "",
    "transcript": "Donald Trump (00:08):\n\nWell, thank you very much, everybody, for being with us today. And I want to thank you, all of these great leaders, for joining us as we welcome, to the White House, the presidents and prime ministers and various other forms of dignitary to this wonderful place. There's nothing like the White House to me. We're represented today and your continent is represented by Gabon, Guinea Bissau, Liberia, Mauritania, and Senegal, all very vibrant places with very valuable land, great minerals, great oil deposits, and wonderful people. Last month, the U.S.-Africa Business Summit had recorded an attendance, an attendance record, actually, and generated 2.5 billion in new economic deals for the United States. On June 27th, the foreign ministers of the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Rwanda visited the White House to sign a historic peace agreement that we worked out. They've been fighting for 30 years. 7 million are dead, and they think the number's actually quite a bit higher than that.\n\n(01:31)It's been a long and vicious fight, and I just wanted to say that the countries represented were very happy that we were able to solve that problem. I think over the next couple of weeks, the leaders of both country will come to sign the final agreement. As you know, we had foreign ministers last week, but we're going to be signing an end to the horrible 30-year war. It's been going on for a long time. I've been reading about it, hearing about it, and it was a vicious war. It was a terrible war. I want to thank our outstanding senior advisor for Africa, Massad Boulos, for helping to mediate this breakthrough. He was very much involved in that settlement. Most people thought it couldn't be done. But there's still much more to be done, and we're going to be facilitating peace, also in places like Sudan where they have a lot of problems. Libya and others, we have… There's a lot of anger on your continent, and we've been able to solve a lot of it.\n\n(02:38)My administration is committed to strengthening our friendships in Africa through economic development efforts that benefit both the United States and our partners. And we're shifting from AID to trade. We had AID, or AID, as we sometimes call it, right to trade. And trade seems to be a foundation that I've been able to settle a lot of these disputes. As an example, India and Pakistan, Kosovo, Serbia, I said, you guys are going to fight, we're not going to trade. And we seem to be quite successful in doing that. To that end, we have closed the USAID group to eliminate waste, fraud, and abuse, which was tremendous waste, fraud, and abuse, and we're working tirelessly to forge new economic opportunities involving both the United States and many African nations. There's great economic potential in Africa, like few other places. In many ways, in the long run, this will be far more effective and sustainable and beneficial than anything else that we can be doing together.\n\n(03:47)I'm eager to work with each of you on your vital issues, and also to discuss security. We've encouraged our staff at the White House to work along with these nations. There's such tremendous wealth there and potential there. We encourage the countries here today to make greater investments in defense, hopefully, of course, buying our equipment because we do make the best defense equipment. I guess we proved that about two weeks ago in Iran, but we make the best equipment, best military equipment anywhere in the world by far. There's nobody close. And keep pursuing the fight against terrorism, which is a big problem in Africa.\n\n(04:29)Immigration will also be on the agenda, and I hope we can bring down the high rates of people overstaying visas, and also make progress on the Safe Third Country Agreements. And once again, I want to thank you all for being here, and it's an honor for me. Some of you, I've met, and some of you, I just got to meet. And I think it would be nice if you said a few words to the press, which is right back here. Do we have a camera over here? It'd be nice if you could… Oh, there it is. You could speak to the… You don't want to turn your head so much. I do it a lot. It's not pleasant, but perhaps we could start with you, please. Thank you very much. Great gentleman, by the way.\n\nMohamed Ould Ghazouani (05:21):\n\nThank you for giving me the floor, Mr. President. First of all, I would like to thank you. Thank you, Mr. President Trump, for inviting us to come here today. I'm President Ghazouani, president of the Islamic Republic of Mauritania. Thank you, Mr. President, for this invitation and the invitation you sent to the other colleagues present here today. This is a very strong message from you, and we are receiving this message very well. This is a message of interest that you're sending to us, and it's a message that you're sending to the whole of Africa. All of this is generous on your part. We are receiving this, and we accept this message from you. Before I talk about my country, I would like to let you know that we are delighted to see President Trump's commitment to our continent. Mr. President, in the short time you've been back in office, the last few months, you came to the rescue for peace. You did it in Asia with Pakistan in India. The war sort of started. And if it had gone on, the consequences could have been a real disaster. Since the beginning, you've been doing a great deal of work on the war in Europe. That is the conflict between Russia and Ukraine. You rushed to Africa to resolve a long-standing problem. Lots of efforts had been made by many heads of states, but your will made it possible for this agreement to be signed. And now, this conflict is behind us.\n\n(08:09)You are currently working with a great deal of enthusiasm, and you're also working on the Middle East. You're paying a great deal of attention to the Middle East. We all know how far back this conflict goes. It is a conflict that is about 80 years old. 70 years? But it is also a war that has been raging for a year and a half. And you've also talked about the human toll. Many people have died in this conflict. Of course, you also stopped the war between Iran and Israel. That could have been a real disaster for the region. It's a sensitive region to start with. Your work in favor of peace has been tremendous, and we are also very interested in supporting peace in the same way.\n\n(09:26)When there's no peace, like you said earlier today, when there is no peace, a lot of other things are lacking. When there is no peace, it is difficult to have prosperity. It is difficult to have calm, to have a sense of quietness. It's hard to sleep. It's hard to go about your business every day. You understand that well, Mr. President, and you're working on this, so thank you. I am the president of Mauritania. Mauritania is a small country, depending on the criteria you apply. If you look at the number of people who live in Mauritania, it's a small country because we have about 5 million people in Mauritania. We might just be a little bit over 5 million. It's a small country also in the sense that what influence it has throughout the world. It's not like the U.S., Mr. President.\n\n(10:50)Internationally, we understand that our weight, our influence is not that great, and we have no complex about this. It's also a small country because of our level of prosperity. We're not a very prosperous country. We have many problems related to the well-being of our population, but it is also a great country, a big country in other ways. Mauritania is a great country in the sense of its strategic position. It is on the Atlantic coast, which makes it a neighbor to the U.S. It is what unites North Africa and Sub-Saharan Africa, or what links the two. That is its strategic position. But also in terms of resources, we have a great deal of resources, many, many resources. And we have a lot of opportunities to offer in terms of investment.\n\n(12:03)We have minerals, rare earths, rare minerals. We have manganese, we have uranium, and we have a good inclination that we have lithium and other minerals. We're the second largest producer, for the last 60 years in Africa, of iron, iron ore. We produce a lot. And we have a lot of resources in our sea waters, so lots of fishing and whatnot. I don't want to spend too much time on this.\n\nDonald Trump (12:46):\n\nBut I appreciate it very much. I appreciate it. Maybe we're going to have to go a little bit quicker than this because we have a whole schedule. If I could just ask your name and your country would be great. Thank you. Please.\n\nSpeaker 1 (13:07):\n\nThank you, Mr. President, and for welcome everything. For us, the second time here to come as a guest. The first time, we had that meeting in Guinea-Bissau. But I will not talk so much, but Guinea-Bissau is a peaceful country. And we are a small country, but we are a great state, not a great state like the United States, but we are a great country as well. And to end, we are be following your dynamics and the war\n\nUmaro Sissoco Embaló (14:00):\n\n… With Russia and Ukraine and you can count on Guinea-Bissau. Thank you very much.\n\nDonald Trump (14:07):\n\nThank you very much. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. Please [inaudible 00:14:16]. Thank you.\n\nJoseph Boakai (14:21):\n\nThank you Mr. President. [inaudible 00:14:19] to the recent celebration of your 249 Anniversary. We did in Liberia at your embassy. Mr. President, we thank you for this opportunity to be here. Liberia is a long-time friend of the United States and we believe in your policy of making America great again and we also go a long way with you in your diplomacy that has to do with economic development and commercial friendship. Liberia has a lot of minerals and one of the things we ask as good friends for a long time is, the opportunity to do a survey of our minerals and also, we are committed to peace and we've been very lucky within our region. We had a country that have had series of democratic elections and our country had been cooling down and also we want to encourage American involvement in the investment in Liberia. I would like to see that happen, we want to work with the United States in peace and security within the region because we are committed to that and we just want to thank you so much for this opportunity.\n\nDonald Trump (15:54):\n\nWell, thank you and such good English. Such beautiful…\n\nJoseph Boakai (15:57):\n\nYes, I know.\n\nDonald Trump (15:58):\n\nWhere did you learn to speak so beautifully? Where were you educated, where?\n\nJoseph Boakai (16:03):\n\nYes sir.\n\nDonald Trump (16:04):\n\nIn Liberia?\n\nJoseph Boakai (16:05):\n\nYes sir.\n\nDonald Trump (16:06):\n\nWell, that's very interesting. That's beautiful English. I have people at this table can't speak nearly as well. They come from…\n\nBrice Clotaire Oligui Nguema (16:13):\n\n[foreign language 00:17:15].\n\nMohamed Ould Ghazouani (16:13):\n\nNo microphone for this speaker.\n\nBrice Clotaire Oligui Nguema (16:13):\n\n[foreign language 00:17:17].\n\nMohamed Ould Ghazouani (17:23):\n\nNo interpretation. There's no microphone for this speaker.\n\nBrice Clotaire Oligui Nguema (17:23):\n\n[foreign language 00:17:32].\n\nMohamed Ould Ghazouani (17:34):\n\nStill no microphone for the speaker.\n\nDonald Trump (17:42):\n\nCould you turn that on? Yeah, this person, there you go.\n\nBrice Clotaire Oligui Nguema (17:46):\n\nYes. [foreign language 00:17:50].\n\nMohamed Ould Ghazouani (17:51):\n\nI would like to commend you Mr. President for the success you had in reaching a peace agreement between Rwanda and the DRC. Africa is a vast continent that has many problems and we truly count on you for your assistance in Sudan and in the Sahel because no investment can be made when there is a war. For investment, you need peace. The other heads of state who are here with me represent countries that are at peace and that has been the case for some time. We also have raw materials, minerals, rare earths, we are not poor countries. We are rich countries when it comes to raw materials, but we need partners to support us and help us develop those resources with win-win partnerships.\n\n(18:51)That is our wish. I often listen to your remarks and speeches Mr. President. We also want our raw materials to be processed locally in our country so that we can create value and to create jobs for youth so that they stop dying. They are crossing the sea, the ocean to go to other countries. That is what we want to have, local processing of raw materials. Gabon is a rich country, we have over 2 million inhabitants and a great deal of diversity, raw materials, oil and gas reserves, and we would like those resources to be tapped using an economic model that fits. Since our liberation, we have changed how we do trade.\n\n(19:54)We have focused on transparency and bids for anyone who wants to come invest in our country. If you follow the news, we have also worked on agreements with the European Union and we wanted to review those because we didn't think that those were win-win opportunities so, our market is open. We want to process manganese locally, which you purchase through a company called Eramet and I'm sure that it's more expensive compared to when you can come and buy it directly from us.\n\n(20:39)In order to do this local processing, we need eight to 10 gigawatts of electricity. Again, this is an open bid. Any American company that wants to invest in electricity in Gabon is welcome to take advantage of that opportunity. Now looking at defense, the Gulf of Guinea is an issue. There is maritime piracy in that area and we want to work together to stabilize it. You said you had the best equipment, the best military equipment and that's what we'd like to have so that we can stop maritime piracy in the Gulf of Guinea.\n\n(21:17)We can't do it alone. We need a reliable and strong partner that is committed and that takes real steps, real action. We also need to be pragmatic and that's what you are, and I'm a general and I am too, I'm pragmatic. I like it when things move quickly. Our country is free, open to one and all, you are welcome to come and invest, otherwise other countries might come instead of you. Thank you.\n\nDonald Trump (21:53):\n\nGood job. Thank you very much, appreciate it. Okay.\n\nMohamed Ould Ghazouani (22:00):\n\nThank you so much, Mr. President. I would like to thank you for this invitation. It is an honor for us to be here at the White House and to have this opportunity to speak with you about the new partnership that you are putting in place with Africa, particularly for investment. I also wanted to commend you for your commitment to peace throughout the world and the incredible diplomatic success that you had with the DRC. As my colleagues mentioned, you said that this put an end to a long war that claimed many lives and thankfully you were here to put an end to this 30-year war. I also wanted to express that Africa supports all efforts to bring back peace to Sudan, Libya, and in the Sahel. Mr. President, as you've seen, you can only do business when there is peace and security and you build peace everywhere in the world so that there can be better investments.\n\n(23:22)The entire world is grateful to you for this. Now with respect to my country, Senegal, I have been president for some 15, 16 months now and I want to reassure all American investors about our country's political stability and our favorable regulatory environment, which we are continuously improving upon in order to attract more investment. I wanted to speak about two projects that I think are an exceptional opportunity. I will speak about the US ecological survey, which can help assess the potential of the minerals in our country and thanks to American companies, we've been able to discover oil and gas. Some 950 billion cubic meters of gas that we can tap into in order to support our economy.\n\n(24:40)And again, here we were able to do this with an American company. Another project I'd like to mention, and again, I would like to invite American investors to take part in this, it's for a digital city. We identified a space within the City of Dakar, it has a view of the sea, it's on some 40 hectares, and this is a great opportunity for American tech companies to come in and make Dakar a tech city open to Africa. I was wondering what your secret was for resolving all these complex crises, and I know you are a tremendous golf player.\n\n(25:36)Golf requires concentration and precision. Qualities that also make for a great leader. Senegal has exceptional opportunities to offer, including in the area of tourism. So, perhaps an investment could be made in a golf course in Senegal. It would just be six hours by flight from New York, from Miami, from Europe, or from the Gulf, and that would be an opportunity for you to show off your skills on the golf course too. Thank you for your attention, sir.\n\nDonald Trump (26:14):\n\nNice. Somewhere to show off my skills, it's a long trip to show off my skill, but that's really nice and he's led a very interesting life. He looks like a very young person, he's a little older than he looks, but a fantastic job. He was treated very unfairly by his government and he prevailed and so congratulations on that, really. Congrats, it was a great job and you've all done a fantastic job and so we'll be talking to you as we have the meal. Do you want to ask any questions, please? Where's my reporter from Africa? There you are, how are you?\n\nSpeaker 2 (26:50):\n\nThank you. I'm fine, thank you Mr. President.\n\nDonald Trump (26:53):\n\nShe's very famous in Africa.\n\nSpeaker 2 (26:58):\n\nThank you, thank you. [inaudible 00:27:01] yeah, thank you. I have one question for the African presidents and one question for President Trump. As you can see, Mr. President Trump, all the African presidents are very happy with your efforts to bring peace in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. My question to you is, today you are making history by receiving five African presidents and showing the interest of the United States to collaborate and to work close with the African nations.\n\n(27:32)African continent is watching, African youth is watching, and this new approach that your administration is taking to deal with African nation, not only based on help but in doing business that everybody can win, is really much appreciated for all the Africans. My question is, are you planning, Mr. President in the future to travel to Africa to see firsthand all those\n\nSpeaker 2 (28:00):\n\n… those countries in Africa, all those potential that those countries have. And for the African leaders, my question is, as you can see, President Trump is working to bring peace, not only in Africa, but also in the world. Are you all considering to nominate President Trump for a Nobel Prize Peace?\n\nDonald Trump (28:23):\n\nThat's a very nice reporter. I got to meet her two weeks ago when we had the Congo and Rwanda and we had some other people up from Africa and I was the first time. But that's very nice. I appreciate the question. It's very nice actually. Would you like to … At some point, I would like to go to Africa. Absolutely. We're going to see what the schedule is, but at some point I would like to do that very much. Would you like to give a fast answer please?\n\nSpeaker 6 (28:59):\n\nThank you very much. Of course, we are supporting this-\n\nMohamed Ould Ghazouani (29:02):\n\nMicrophone please.\n\nDonald Trump (29:04):\n\nMicrophone, please.\n\nMohamed Ould Ghazouani (29:14):\n\nWe are in favor of this dynamic for peace. We are very committed on peace. I am the first head of state who went to Russia and who went to Ukraine, both since the start of the war. I was held the presidency of ECOWAS and I went to see Mr. Putin. We spoke for four hours and then I went to Ukraine. I spent 12 hours on a train to speak to President Zelenskyy. But now the weight of President Trump is something else altogether. We are with you. We are behind you to see what we can do to help bring peace back. No one wins when there's war. So you have our support so that we can bring peace back. Thank you.\n\nDonald Trump (30:08):\n\nThank you very much. Appreciate it. Go ahead, please.\n\nMohamed Ould Ghazouani (30:16):\n\nThank you, Mr. President Trump, thank you for your questions. A Nobel Peace Prize, well, I don't see any problem with it. I think that President Trump deserves it for all the efforts that he's worked on and he brought peace back in the SIAC region. That is my region, the region where DRC and Rwanda signed a deal. And so he is now bringing peace back into a region where that was never possible. So I believe that he does deserve a Nobel Peace Prize. That is my opinion on this.\n\nDonald Trump (31:03):\n\nWell, thank you very much. Very nice. Thank you. I didn't know I'd be treated this nicely. This is great. We could do this all day long. Thank you very much. Please go ahead.\n\nJoseph Boakai (31:17):\n\nMr. President. I believe that we have to continue to support America's in the strength to be able to bring about peace in the world. America is a melting point and also a country that we all look forward to. And I want to encourage you because without peace, we can't have [inaudible 00:31:44] living and we stand with you on that.\n\nDonald Trump (31:49):\n\nThank you. Well said. Please.\n\nMohamed Ould Ghazouani (31:55):\n\nThank you, Mr. President, and thank you for your question. Very important question indeed. Forgive me for saying this, but unfortunately I don't really understand, I don't know how things work when it comes to Nobel Prizes, but I can guarantee you that Mauritania would never be opposed to President Trump receiving a Nobel Peace Prize because he's already working very hard in favor of peace throughout the world with no distinction, no regard to what continent and so on. And he's working on areas where there are tensions everywhere and he's committed towards peace and our world needs more peace. Thank you.\n\nDonald Trump (32:47):\n\nVery much. Thank you.\n\nMohamed Ould Ghazouani (32:53):\n\nThank you very much. The jury will decide, it's not a matter of voting amongst our countries, but what is for sure is that the results and the work has been done in such a short amount of time show that you would be a good recipient. And I'm sure that the jury sees that and the rest of the world sees it as well and understands it. When the time comes, I think everyone will see that it is a deserved prize. Congratulations on what you've done so far. If we took a poll, I think you would be very far ahead in those polls.\n\nDonald Trump (33:42):\n\nVery nice. All of you. Thank you very much. I appreciate it. Peter.\n\nPeter (33:46):\n\nThank you, President Trump. James Comey and John Brennan, now, under criminal investigation related to the Trump Russia probe, do you want to see these two guys behind bars?\n\nDonald Trump (33:57):\n\nWell, I know nothing about it other than what I read today, but I will tell you, I think they're very dishonest people. I think they're crooked as hell and maybe they have to pay a price for that. I believe they are truly bad people and dishonest people. So whatever happens, happens.\n\nPeter (34:18):\n\nAnd now a few weeks after the strikes that you ordered on the nuclear facilities in Iran, there is an Iranian official who says you, President Trump, have done something that he can no longer sunbathe in Mar-a-Lago. As you lie there with your stomach to the sun, a small drone might hit you in the navel. It's very simple. Do you think that's a real threat? And when is the last time you went sunbathing anyway?\n\nDonald Trump (34:45):\n\nIt's been a long time. It's been a long time. I don't know. Maybe I was around seven or so. I'm not too big into it. Yeah, I guess it's a threat. I'm not sure it's a threat actually, but perhaps it is.\n\nPeter (35:02):\n\nAnd on one other subject, two Democratic senators now, Cory Booker and Alex Padilla have a new bill out. They want to require CBP and ICE officers to have legible IDs and they don't want CBP or ICE officers covering their faces. Would you ever sign that?\n\nDonald Trump (35:18):\n\nWell, they wouldn't be saying that if they didn't hate our country. And they obviously do. I'm surprised that they would do it. Knowing a little bit about them, I don't know them well. But these officers are doing a tremendous job, they're great patriots. If you expose them because of statements like have been made by Democrats and others on the left, usually mostly, I think probably exclusively. You put them in great danger, tremendous danger. And it's sort of funny when people picket in front of Columbia, in front of Harvard and they have masks on, more than masks. I mean, you can't see anything. Nobody complains about that.\n\n(36:01)But when a patriot who works for ICE or border patrol puts a mask on so that they won't recognize him and his family, so they can lead a little bit of a normal life after having worked so hard and so dangerously, there's a problem with that. So this is why this is the problem with the Democrats to have, they have a lot of bad things going on in their heads. They've lost their confidence, number one, and they really, they've become somewhat deranged. I want to do whatever's necessary to protect our great law enforcement people. And they are right at the top of the list.\n\nPeter (36:45):\n\nAnd your agriculture department also announced this week that they're going to start limiting Chinese ownership of American farmland. Why do you think that the Chinese been buying up all this farmland in our country, so close to military installations?\n\nDonald Trump (37:00):\n\nWell, I don't want to get into that. I have a very good relationship with President Xi. We're going to see, and they're going to be making a recommendation to me, but we have a very good relationship. As you know, they're paying a lot of tariffs to the United States now. And so I'm not going to get into that right now. Yeah, please.\n\nSpeaker 3 (37:21):\n\nThank you. Yesterday, the Wall Street Journal reported that the White House was weighing whether to send another Patriot air defense system to Ukraine. Can you confirm that reporting?\n\nDonald Trump (37:32):\n\nThey would like it. They've asked for it. They're very rare indeed, because a lot of systems have been sent to Ukraine. But they would like to. I know they made the request. We're going to have to take a look at it. It's very expensive, very expensive system. It's a shame that we have to spend so much money on a war that would've never happened if I were president. That's a terrible, terrible war over there and feel shame. It's very sad, when you talk about a system like that, highly sophisticated, tremendous amount of money, and they're doing it because they want to prevent death. They're getting hit hard, very hard. So we're looking at it.\n\nSpeaker 7 (38:12):\n\nAlso on Russia-\n\nSpeaker 3 (38:13):\n\n[inaudible 00:38:13] as well. Ukraine was hit by over 700 drones sent by Russia last night. What's your response to that attack?\n\nDonald Trump (38:19):\n\nWell, I've been sort of letting people know I'm not happy about what's going on. It's a war that should have never happened. It should not happen. Now they're losing. Now it's up, I've been saying 5,000, now it's up to 7,000. Think of it, 7,000 people a week on both sides. 7,000 people, young, mostly military people. Young souls are dead and dying. And it should be stopped. It should be stopped. Very sad to see what's happening. Yes, please.\n\nSpeaker 4 (38:49):\n\nSir. Can you explain how you calculated your latest round of tariffs? Was there a formula that was used and do you expect any of these countries to face tariffs as well?\n\nDonald Trump (38:59):\n\nThe formula was a formula based on common sense, based on deficits, based on how we've been treated over the years and based on raw numbers. And we're going to have a couple of more coming out today, Brazil as an example, has been not good to us, not good at all. We're going to be releasing a Brazil number I think later on this afternoon or tomorrow morning. But they're based on very substantial facts and also past history. You look at the past history, we never had anybody in the White House that understood the numbers or were into it like I have. We've taken in hundreds of billions of dollars in tariffs, hundreds of billions, and we haven't even started yet. And it's going to be a great thing for our country. I think it's going to be a fair thing for the world. And we really haven't had too many complaints because I'm keeping them at a very low number. Very conservative, as you would say, number.\n\n(40:03)And we haven't had … Sure, they will be complaining at certain points, but we haven't had complaints. We've been treated very unfairly by both friend and foe and friend has treated us very badly. It's not even believable that for so many years I was using tariffs in my first administration. We had the most successful financially administration that there's ever been. This is going to be much better. But we got cut short with the COVID because I didn't think it was appropriate when Italy, Spain. So the horror showed that a lot of the countries went through. So I cut it a little bit short, but we took in hundreds of billions of dollars and we had the most successful term ever from a president financially. But this is going to be much more successful. Yes, please.\n\nSpeaker 4 (40:55):\n\nDo you expect any of the countries here to face tariffs as well?\n\nDonald Trump (41:00):\n\nI haven't thought of it, but maybe. I don't know. Let's see. I like him, him, him, him and him. No, I don't think so. Not too much. It's very good. These are friends of mine now.\n\nSpeaker 5 (41:11):\n\nThank you for taking our questions. Mr. President. You talked about the amount of external revenue the country has brought in thanks to your tariffs. Can you talk about how these hundreds of billions of dollars that are getting brought in will help grow the country and what do you hope to put it towards?\n\nDonald Trump (41:24):\n\nWell, bigger than the tariffs actually are the fact that when you charge the tariffs at a certain point they say, well, we can't pay those tariffs. It doesn't make economic sense. These are wealthy countries and they or their companies will come into our country and build. And that's actually happening. If you had a very low tariff, there'd be no incentive to do that. If you have no tariff like we used to have, which is so stupid, it's not even believable. But then obviously they make their product, the product in their country. They have the jobs, they have the income, they have the taxes, they have everything, and they just send it into us. And it's jobs\n\nDonald Trump (42:00):\n\n… jobs that we wouldn't get. Now the wheel has turned and what we're doing is we're… I mean more important, we're taking in hundreds of billions of dollars, money that we've never seen before. But more important than that, we have a lot of people that would rather not have to pay that. So they're coming in and they're building plants.\n\n(42:20)AI, we're leading everybody, including China, by a lot with AI. They're building their own plant. You heard me say yesterday they're building their own electric-generating plants to go along with the factories or plants that they're building. If they want to do that, we're getting them fast approvals, very fast turnarounds. They're using mostly natural gas to start off, but they're using coal. They have the right to use coal. They have the right to use nuclear. Nuclear has come a long way in the last five years. So we're getting them very fast approvals. We have factories and plants building at a level that we've never had in this country before. Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 5 (42:58):\n\nAnd secondly, a study from the Council of Economic Advisers, you put it on Truth Social yesterday, it showed that your assessment that tariffs would slow inflation was accurate, and that the prices of imported goods since February has fallen. That your assessment was right, that critics were wrong. Why do so-called experts continually misread your economic policy, sir?\n\nDonald Trump (43:17):\n\nWell, it's not the experts. It's the fake news and a combination of that and the Democrats. I saw an ad on television today on Fox, and it was some ad about, \"Oh, Trump has raised costs.\" It's the opposite. I actually put out a statement. I brought down costs. I brought down the cost of groceries. I brought down the cost of energy. Tremendously energy, tremendously groceries. If you remember my first week in office, the press was screaming at me about the cost of eggs. They were four times higher than they were just a short time ago. That was caused by Biden and stupid policies, and we got that down. And by Easter it was normalized, and now it's actually even at a lower price.\n\n(44:01)So when I see an ad like that, it's always good to respond I feel. I feel you have to respond. It was an ad that things are more costly. No, they're much less costly. Yesterday, $1.99 a gallon is two states. Three states were selling gasoline at $1.99. You haven't seen that for a long time and I brought costs way down. Just about every cost. I can't think of a cost that went up, but just about every cost.\n\n(44:27)So what they do is they lie. I mean, they take ads. You'd almost think that the advertising station would stop it because they know it's wrong. It's such a lie. All you can do is say it's a lie and explain it. I guess I have the ability to explain it at conferences like this. So I like to take advantage of it and do it, but costs are substantially down under the Trump Administration.\n\n(44:54)And as you know, Biden had the highest inflation, I believe, in the history of our country. They say 48 years, but regardless, I think it was really the highest in the history of our country. And they were up to numbers that nobody ever saw before and we have inflation now totally under control. We have a Fed chairman that, if he was doing his job properly, would lower interest rates, but we're bullying through even that. We're doing so well it's not having that kind of an impact on us.\n\n(45:23)But you want to see a rocket ship? We should have the lowest interest rates, because without us there's nothing. And we have a strong country now and we're taking in a lot of money, and other countries aren't even complaining. They got away with murder. They took advantage of a lot of very stupid people that sat in this seat, very stupid people or people that didn't understand business, or something or something was going on. But hard to believe that they got away with it for so many years.\n\n(45:55)And I'm treating them very fairly. Again, we have countries with tremendous deficits with us, where we essentially lose a lot of money, and we are changing that around very rapidly. And I think it's about time somebody did it.\n\nSpeaker 8 (46:12):\n\nSir? President?\n\nDonald Trump (46:13):\n\nYeah, please.\n\nSpeaker 8 (46:14):\n\nSir, yesterday you said that you were not sure who ordered the munitions halted to Ukraine. Have you since been able to figure that out?\n\nDonald Trump (46:23):\n\nWell, I haven't thought about it, because we're looking at Ukraine right now and munitions. But no, I have not gone into it.\n\nSpeaker 8 (46:30):\n\nWhat does it say that such a big decision could be made inside your government without you knowing?\n\nDonald Trump (46:35):\n\nI would know. If a decision was made, I will know. I'll be the first to know. In fact, most likely I'd give the order. But I haven't done that yet. Yeah, please.\n\nSpeaker 3 (46:44):\n\nCan I ask how your meeting with Netanyahu went over the last couple of days, and how realistic do you think a ceasefire is this week?\n\nDonald Trump (46:51):\n\nWell, we're talking about Gaza for the most part. I think we have a chance this week or next week. Not definitely. There's nothing definite about war, and Gaza and all of the other places that we all deal with so much. But there's a very good chance that we'll have a settlement, an agreement of some kind this week, and maybe next week if not.\n\nSpeaker 3 (47:13):\n\n[inaudible 00:47:13] Africa as well. So the African Growth and Opportunity Act, which has been central to many sub-Saharan countries having access to the US market, that's due to expire in September. Are you hoping to extend that beyond it?\n\nDonald Trump (47:26):\n\nWell, we'll take a look at that. Yes, please.\n\nSpeaker 9 (47:29):\n\nThank you. That's up to Congress to take a first crack at. We know that program has been in place for about 20 years, and at the end result of that, we see a lot of other countries operating in Africa. We still see a lot of tariff and non-tariff barriers in Africa. So I think any discussion about that act would also have to think about how we address those kinds of barriers.\n\nSpeaker 10 (47:49):\n\nThank you.\n\nDonald Trump (47:49):\n\nYeah, Peter.\n\nPeter (47:51):\n\nPresident Trump, in Alvarado, Texas a few days ago, 10 people wearing all black allegedly set off fireworks outside an ICE office to lure the officers out so they could ambush them, shoot at them. They had guns and vests and two-way radios. Do you think that this was an isolated incident or do you think there's a national threat of a left-wing militia that is targeting ICE and CBP?\n\nDonald Trump (48:18):\n\nWell, I think you have some very stupid people in the left who have some money that are making it available to these people. Because you look at the guns they had, they were brand new. You look at even the clothing they were wearing, it looked like it just came out of some military shop. So you have some very stupid people that if anything ever happened, they'd be the first to go. They don't understand that they'd be the first to go. They'd be the first ones hit. But there is money being put behind people when you look at the weapons they have, the newness of the weapons, rifles that just came out and they have the latest model. So there's something going on and we'll get to the bottom of it.\n\nPeter (48:57):\n\nAnd what do you think the penalty should be for these people if they are found guilty for people who-\n\nDonald Trump (49:03):\n\nVery stiff.\n\nPeter (49:04):\n\nShoot at ICE officers.\n\nDonald Trump (49:06):\n\nVery, very stiff. Very stiff. A long time in jail. A long time. And one got hit yesterday in the neck and he fortunately is going to be okay, but he got hit yesterday in the neck. No good.\n\nPeter (49:23):\n\nAnd what would you think if I read you a quote from a lawmaker who says, about ICE, \"To abolish it, to treat them as criminals or anything that is inappropriate and outrageous.\" I told you that that was Democrat John Fetterman.\n\nDonald Trump (49:37):\n\nWow. By the way, I assume when you read that because you paused in the middle… You're going to have to read that again without the pause. Could you read that again, please?\n\nPeter (49:48):\n\n\"To abolish it, to treat them as criminals or anything, that's inappropriate and outrageous.\"\n\nDonald Trump (49:53):\n\nSo he's saying that to treat the people that did the shooting is-\n\nPeter (49:57):\n\nTo treat ICE officers.\n\nDonald Trump (49:58):\n\nOh, okay, good. Because the way you read it, it really was the opposite. That's okay. That's all right. I think that's what he meant. No, the new John Fetterman is exactly what you said. He's right. He's right. And we have to protect our police officers and we will and we have been. If you saw the stats released by the FBI the other day, the murder rate's way down. The lowest it's been in a long time and that took place over the last six months. For the last six months, murder, it's a hell of a subject to have to talk about, but murder is way down at almost getting to be modern day records. So despite the fact that we have a lot of people that came into the country that shouldn't be here.\n\nSpeaker 11 (50:41):\n\nMr. President?\n\nDonald Trump (50:41):\n\nYes, please.\n\nSpeaker 11 (50:42):\n\nSo two questions. One on tariffs, the other on IRS. On tariffs, China is reportedly softening their impact on US tariffs in Africa, announcing last month that they would halt charges on imports for nearly all of its African partners.\n\nDonald Trump (50:58):\n\nGood.\n\nSpeaker 11 (50:58):\n\nDoes this move by China influence your thinking, your approach to tariffs on the continent?\n\nDonald Trump (51:04):\n\nWell, we treat Africa great in many different ways, including with tariffs. But parts of Africa charge us tremendous tariffs, as you know, and they're going to be dropping those tariffs. They've already informed me they're going to be dropping those tariffs, but we treat Africa far better than China or anybody else. Anyplace else.\n\nSpeaker 11 (51:23):\n\nAnd on the IRS, the IRS says that churches can now endorse political candidates. What's your reaction to this and how do you expect this to influence some of the work that's afoot on the continent? There's a lot of American churches that are doing missionary work on the continent. Do you support that?\n\nDonald Trump (51:42):\n\nI love the fact that churches can endorse a political candidate. I think so, because we have a lot of respect for the people that lead the church, for the pastors and the ministers and the rabbis. And all different leaders, all different religions and people respect those people. And I think there's nothing wrong. It was a very big penalty if that took place just a little while ago. They had a thing called the Johnson Act and it was a very big penalty. I think it's great if a pastor, minister, priest, rabbi, and we could very much go into your religion, by the way, which is something that people have a great respect for throughout the world. If somebody of faith wants to endorse, I think it's something that I'd like to hear.\n\n(52:32)And I can guarantee you the people that they're with every Saturday or Sunday or whenever it is they're with, they want to hear from these people. And it was a very severe penalty. Those people were not allowed to speak up. Now they're allowed to speak up. No, I think it's terrific.\n\nSpeaker 12 (52:48):\n\nMr. President, your administration took new actions against Harvard University today. Are you still optimistic about reaching a deal with the university?\n\nDonald Trump (52:56):\n\nOh yeah, I think so. Harvard's been very bad. Totally anti-Semitic. Yeah, they'll absolutely reach a deal. Peter?\n\nPeter (53:05):\n\nI just got a text from our colleague, John Roberts. He says that we are now reporting the guy who was arrested in the Alvarado, Texas incident for tampering with the evidence was a green card recipient under the Biden administration and a prior DACA recipient. What do you think of that?\n\nDonald Trump (53:22):\n\nIt's very sad. It's very bad. A lot of them are here. 21 million, I think it's higher than that, by the way, but they say 21 million people came in. Many of them are criminals. Many of them are murderers. 11,888 is what they say are murderers and they came in through open border policies. No checking, no vetting, no nothing. And we have a lot of that. And despite that, we have crime down, which is pretty amazing.\n\nPeter (53:54):\n\n[inaudible 00:53:55] this is a long meeting so-\n\nDonald Trump (53:54):\n\nAnd say hello to John. Say hello to John Robertson.\n\nPeter (53:56):\n\nI will. I'm sure he is watching this right now. A lot of news has broken since we've been in here. Axios says, \"A secret White House meeting between Steve Witkoff, Ron Dermer and a Qatari envoy on Tuesday led to significant progress in the negotiations over the Gaza hostage and ceasefire deal. What can you tell us about this secret meeting?\n\nDonald Trump (54:12):\n\nIt's very possible. I will tell you, we're getting very close to a deal. I don't know if it's secret or not secret, but it doesn't matter to me. Secret's fine if it gets us to where we want to be. We want to have a ceasefire, we want to have peace. We want to get the hostages back, and I think we're close to doing it. Okay. Thank you all very much. Thank you very much. Thank you. Good job everybody. That was really a good job.",

    "transcript": "President Trump (00:01):\n\nThank you very much everybody. It's an honor to have Mimi and Sarah with us, friends of mine for a long time, and we had a tremendous success together and I think it will only go on to be even greater success in the future. So it's really nice to have you at the White House. It's nothing like the White House and it's great to have you both and all of your wonderful people. Ron, we've worked together for a long time and we've done well together. We had a great time. We say's a lot of work, but we had a great result recently and we're going to have a lot of great results, so it's great to have you. Thank you very much.\n\nBibi (00:37):\n\nThank you. I want to express the appreciation and admiration not only of all Israelis, but of the Jewish people and many, many admirers around the world for your leadership. Your leadership of the free world, your leadership of a just cause, and the pursuit of peace and security in which you are leading in many lands. But now, especially in the Middle East, we have great opportunities.\n\n(01:07)President has an extraordinary team, and I think our teams together make an extraordinary combination to meet challenges and seize opportunities. But the President has already realized great opportunities. He forged the Abraham Accords. He's forging peace as we speak in one country, in one region after the other. So I want to present to you, Mr. President, the letter I sent to the Nobel Prize Committee. It's nominating you for the peace Prize, which is well-deserved and you should get it.\n\nPresident Trump (01:44):\n\nThank you very much. This I didn't know. Well, thank you very much.\n\nBibi (01:50):\n\nThank you.\n\nPresident Trump (01:50):\n\nComing from you in particular, this is very meaningful. Thank you very much, Bibi.\n\nBibi (01:55):\n\nThank you for everything you're doing.\n\nPresident Trump (01:56):\n\nThank you. It's a great honor. Thank you very much everybody. Appreciate it.\n\nSpeaker 5 (02:02):\n\nMr. President, have you spoken with any of the families of the victims of the Texas flood, and can you talk about what you would like to do when you travel there on Friday?\n\nPresident Trump (02:09):\n\nWell, we're going to just make it as comfortable as possible for the State of Texas. They have a great governor. They have wonderful senators, they have wonderful representatives, and we're going to work together with them. And we have been working really very hard. This whole table has been working. That was a terrible event. Terrible event. You saw that Bibi, where Texas was just absolutely so badly hurt by something that was a big surprise late in the evening. So we'll be working with the governor and all of the people of Texas. We'll be going on Friday.\n\nSpeaker 1 (02:43):\n\nMr. President, there was a security incident in Northern Gaza today, quite around the time that the Prime Minister was meeting the Secretary of State, Mr. Steve Woodcock. And a number of IDF soldiers reportedly [inaudible 00:02:56] possibly killed. Does that in any way put a wrinkle in ceasefire negotiations with the [inaudible 00:03:01]?\n\nPresident Trump (03:01):\n\nI don't think so. They want to meet and they want to have that ceasefire, so I don't think so. Steve, could you respond to this? You know about it?\n\nSteve (03:11):\n\nWell, I think it's terribly unfortunate. Terribly unfortunate. We were just talking about it, how tragic it is, but we have an opportunity to finally get a peace deal, Mr. Prime Minister, as we discussed, and I'm hopeful for it very quickly.\n\nSpeaker 2 (03:26):\n\nMr. president, are the tariff letters that you sent today final offers, or are they negotiated?\n\nPresident Trump (03:34):\n\nMore or less final offer.\n\nSpeaker 2 (03:35):\n\nSo South Korea, Japan should take it or leave it?\n\nPresident Trump (03:37):\n\nWe're always subject to negotiate something that's fair. But we've talked to most of the countries and pretty much they've had their way for many, many decades, as you know. And it was time that we just wanted fairness. This is not really equitable from our standpoint because it's just a small token by comparison to the damage that's been done over the years. But we had no other president that was willing to do this.\n\n(04:02)I did it in my first term with China and others. We took in hundreds of billions of dollars of tariffs. No inflation. The most successful period of time that we've ever had financially in the country the first term. I think this term's going to be much better, even much better than that. That was the best ever, and this is going to be, I think, substantially better. And we're on the way to doing that.\n\n(04:23)We've already taken in over a hundred million dollars worth of tariffs and we haven't even started. And all I say to the other countries is some of them wanted to make a deal and want to be fair. Others perhaps got a little bit spoiled. They were a little bit spoiled because for 30, 40 years, 50 years, they were taking advantage of the country. So we're going to, I would say final. But if they call with a different offer, and if I like it, we'll do it.\n\nSpeaker 2 (04:50):\n\nIs the August one deadline firm now? Is that it?\n\nPresident Trump (04:57):\n\nNo, I would say firm, but not 100% firm. If they call up and they say, \"We'd like to do something a different way,\" we're going to be open to that. But essentially that's the way it is right now.\n\nSpeaker 1 (05:08):\n\nMr. president, is your Palestinian relocation plan still on the table? Is there a plan? Any progress in finding [inaudible 00:05:16]?\n\nPresident Trump (05:16):\n\nYeah, Bibi, why don't I let you answer that question? Wait a minute. Wait, he's got to answer that question.\n\nSpeaker 3 (05:21):\n\nOh, I'm sorry.\n\nBibi (05:22):\n\nI think President Trump had a brilliant vision. It's called free choice. If people want to stay, they can stay, but if they want to leave, they should be able to leave. It shouldn't be a prison. It should be an open place and give people a free choice. We're working with the United States very closely about finding countries that will seek to realize what they always say, that they want to give the Palestinians a better future. And I think we're getting close to finding several countries, and I think this will give again, the freedom to choose. Palestinians should have it, and I hope that we can secure it close by.\n\nPresident Trump (06:07):\n\nAnd we've had great cooperation from surrounding, meaning surrounding Israel, surrounding countries, great cooperation from every single one of them. So something good will happen. Brian, did you have something.\n\nBrian (06:18):\n\nMr. President, you've mentioned before, you want to go down as your legacy as the peacemaker. Are we in the last chapter of closing out peace amongst this conflict now and all the other ones that are going on?\n\nPresident Trump (06:31):\n\nWell, I hope so. Look, we did a job with India and Pakistan and Serbia, Kosovo, Rwanda and the Congo. And this was all over the last three weeks or so, Marco, right? And others that were ready to fight, and we stopped a lot of fights. I think a very big one, frankly, a very, very big one was Indian Pakistan, and we stopped that over trade. We're dealing with India, we're dealing with Pakistan, and we say, \"We're not going to be dealing with you at all if you're going to fight.\" And they were maybe at a nuclear stage. They're both nuclear powers. And I think stopping that was very important. We're trying to help out with a Biden-created monster, this whole thing that's happening with Russia and Ukraine. It's a horrible thing. And I'm not happy with President Putin at all. But this is something that would've never happened if I were president. This was a war that was never going to happen. Go ahead, Brian.\n\nBrian (07:27):\n\nI was going to say, how would you address your critics that in the election they said that you would cause the next World War III, when in fact you're solving all the problems.\n\nPresident Trump (07:38):\n\nI'm stopping wars. I'm stopping wars, and I hate to see people killed. As an example, Ukraine and Russia, they're not Americans there being killed. They're not Israeli that are being killed. These are all Russians and all Ukrainians. But it's 5,000, maybe 7,000 last week, 7,500 last week. Mostly soldiers, but people in towns and cities that are getting hit. But death is mostly soldiers. They don't come from here, but it's 7,000 last week souls, and if I can stop that. They have parents and they have sisters and brothers and getting married and who knows? They're just people, but they're souls. And if I can stop a war because I have an ability to do so… I'm disappointed, frankly, that President Putin hasn't stopped. I'm not happy about it either.\n\nSpeaker 4 (08:35):\n\nMr. President, on the Iran talks, can you say if you've scheduled the next round of Iran talks? And then also on strikes.\n\nPresident Trump (08:41):\n\nWe have scheduled Iran talks and they want to talk. They took a big drubbing I think when we hit the three sites, really I would say the three sites, not just the one. The one was a big one and it was deep in granite, and it was obliterated. It turned out the Atomic\n\nPresident Trump (09:00):\n\nMy Energy Commission said it is obliterated. I would just want to take our hats off to those incredible flyers, the people that flew that big machine, and frankly, the mechanics and everybody else. They had zero. They flew for 37 hours with zero problem mechanically. When you're thinking, carrying the biggest bombs ever, the biggest bombs that we've ever dropped on anybody when you think non-nuclear, and we want to keep it non-nuclear, by the way. But they did a phenomenal job. It was an amazing job, and I think that was… I was talking to Bibi about it before. That was the very beginning of the end. It ended very quickly after that. I don't want to say what it reminded me of, but if you go back a long time ago, it reminded people of a certain other event, and Harry Truman's picture is now in the lobby in a nice location in the lobby where it should have been. But that stopped a lot of fighting and this stopped a lot of fighting. When that happened, it was a whole different ball game.\n\nSpeaker 6 (10:05):\n\nOn future Iran strikes, what can you say? What might make you have the desire to do another strike on Iran?\n\nPresident Trump (10:11):\n\nAnother what?\n\nSpeaker 6 (10:11):\n\nAnother strike on Iran.\n\nPresident Trump (10:13):\n\nI hope you we're not going to have to do that. I can't imagine wanting to do that. I can't imagine them wanting to do it. They want to meet. They want to meet, they want to work something out.\n\nSpeaker 6 (10:22):\n\nCan you say when?\n\nPresident Trump (10:23):\n\nThey're very different now than they were two weeks ago.\n\nSpeaker 6 (10:26):\n\nIs there a date yet, sir, for the Iran talk, or a city? Do you know when and where the next round of Iran talks will be?\n\nPresident Trump (10:34):\n\nWell, I can tell you, I'd rather not say, but you'll be reading about it tomorrow or seeing it tomorrow.\n\nSpeaker 6 (10:40):\n\nMr. President, what is the holdup currently in a ceasefire with Hamas?\n\nPresident Trump (10:44):\n\nIn which?\n\nSpeaker 6 (10:46):\n\nIn the ceasefire between Israel and Hamas, what's currently the holdup?\n\nPresident Trump (10:51):\n\nI don't think there is a holdup. Well, I don't think there's a holdup.\n\nSpeaker 6 (10:54):\n\nDo you think that you're going to do a deal?\n\nPresident Trump (10:56):\n\nI think things are going along very well. They just left each other and it was not a pleasant period of a few days. It was longer than a few days, but this was not a pleasant period of time. And we were… At the end, 14 missiles were shot and every single missile was shot out of the air. It was pretty amazing, and that was the end. And they told us they were coming and where they were and what time they were coming, and they said, \"If you'd like to have a different time, we'll do that.\" And that's respect when they do that. I appreciated that they did that. There was no surprise. We got the soldiers out of the base in Qatar in this case, but they knew they were coming. 14 missiles were coming. \"One o'clock,\" they said. \"Would you like to make it later?\"\n\n(11:43)They said, \"No, let them come at one o'clock.\" And at one o'clock, everybody was… As you know, over 5,000 people left the base, and we had three gunners and three assistants. And out of the 14 that was shot, all 14 were knocked down, and that was the end. That was about it. And we had a rough time, but sometimes you need the rough time in order to get… I think things are going to be really settled down a lot in the Middle East. And they respect us and they respect Israel. They respect a lot of things that took place. Nobody's ever seen equipment like what we sent over to knock out those sites, but when those sites were knocked out, it essentially, that was the end.\n\nSpeaker 6 (12:28):\n\nDo you think that there can be a two-state solution that creates an independent Palestine?\n\nPresident Trump (12:32):\n\nI don't know. I'd ask Bibi that question. You have the greatest man in the world to answer that age-old question, two-state. Go ahead. Give him your honest answer.\n\nBibi (12:42):\n\nI think Palestinians should have all the powers to govern themselves, but none of the powers to threaten us, and that means that certain powers like overall security will always remain in our hands. Now that is a fact and no one in Israel will agree to anything else because we don't commit suicide. We want life, we cherish life for ourselves, for our neighbors, and I think we can work out a peace between us and the entire Middle East with President Trump's leadership. And by working together, I think we can establish a very, very broad peace that will include all our neighbors.\n\nSpeaker 7 (13:24):\n\nMr. President, a question on Iran. You have asserted that there's complete and total destruction of their nuclear facilities, so what is the basis of the talks going forward? Is it to cap future nuclear activity? Is it ballistic missiles, terror support, economic-based opportunities? What are the-\n\nPresident Trump (13:41):\n\nIt's really a good question because if you remember, when it was done, I said, \"What's the purpose of talking? It's been knocked out and knocked out completely.\" But they've requested a meeting and I'm going to go to a meeting, and if we can put something down on paper, that will be fine. That'll be good. I think they've gained a lot of respect for us. I think they've gained a lot of respect for Israel also, but they would like to meet and we're going to have a meeting. Steve, when is that meeting going to be? Do you want to say?\n\nSpeaker 8 (14:10):\n\nRather very quickly. Very quickly, in the next week or so.\n\nPresident Trump (14:16):\n\nSo we'll see what happens. I think it would be nice to memorialize it, put it down, but because of the incredible result of that attack, if you want to call it an attack, I didn't think it was necessary to have it in writing. I think we spoke. That speaks much louder than writing, but I can also understand why they'd want it. And they've been very nice, they've been very respectful, and it began by them telling us about 14. They had to do… You know what 14 represents, right? Do you know what 14 represents? Right? You know that, right? The number of bombs dropped, so it was representative. We got them all. Behind you, please? No, you.\n\nSpeaker 9 (15:00):\n\nOh, me? Oh. So this is question for the Prime Minister. The likely next mayor of New York City, Zohran Mamdani, a Democrat, a socialist and a vocal critic of Israel and of yourself, and has said he would arrest you if you came to New York City if he was mayor. Is that something you take seriously? Are you concerned about that? Do you have a response to that?\n\nBibi (15:19):\n\nNo, I'm not concerned about that.\n\nPresident Trump (15:21):\n\nI'll get him out.\n\nBibi (15:23):\n\nLook, there's enough craziness in the world, but I guess it never ends. This is folly, and it's silly in many ways because it's just not serious, but what is serious is the question I was asked before. After October 7th, people said the Palestinians had a state, a Hamas state in Gaza and look what they did with it. They didn't build it up. They built down into bunkers, into terror tunnels, after which they massacred our people, raped our women, beheaded our men, invaded our cities and our towns and our kibbutzim, and did horrendous, horrendous massacres, the kind of which we didn't see since World War II and the Nazis, the Holocaust. So people aren't likely to say, \"Let's just give them another state.\" It'll be a platform to destroying Israel.\n\n(16:13)We'll work out a peace with our Palestinian neighbors, those who don't want to destroy us, and we'll work out a peace in which our security, the sovereign power of security always remains in our hands. Now, people will say, \"It's not a complete state. It's not a state. It's not that.\" We don't care. We vowed never again. Never again is now. It's not going to happen again.\n\nSpeaker 9 (16:37):\n\nSo we'll see you in New York next year?\n\nBibi (16:39):\n\nOh, well, look, I'm going to come there with President Trump and we'll see. How do you know who the mayor will be? I don't know that. Do we know that?\n\nPresident Trump (16:50):\n\nHe's going to be very fine, and who knows? We don't know who the mayor's going to be yet, but this is a communist. He's not a socialist, he's a communist, and he's said some really bad things about Jewish people and he said some really bad things about a lot of people, and I think he's going through a little bit of a honeymoon right now, but he might make it. But it all comes through the White House. He needs the money through the White House. He needs a lot. He's going to behave, he'll behave. He better behave, otherwise he's going to have big problems. But it's a philosophy that this country is not ready for and it never will be.\n\n(17:22)By the way, we have a man with us who thought this was going to be a very glamorous, easy job. He's the ambassador to Israel, Mike Huckabee, former governor, former everything. I'd say he's a former everything, and respected and loved by everybody. And he loves Israel, he loves the state of Israel and nobody loves it much more. And he's not Jewish and he loves Israel, and he wanted to be there. I said, \"You know, Mike, it could be dangerous.\" \"No, no, no.\" Well, at least I was right about that. He was in every bunker you could be in. He was running around from bunker to bunker, but he's still with us, fortunately, and he's\n\nPresident Trump (18:00):\n\nHe's done a great job. Would you say a few words, Mike?\n\nMike (18:02):\n\nI just want to say what an honor it's to serve you, Mr. President, and to see a historic horizon that we are looking at in the Middle East. And when the President made his trip to the Middle East and then he really reached out to the new Syrian Government knowing they needed the partner and knowing that they could pick the wrong partner and what the President did, which took us all off guard. But the strategic move in that has set up something that is absolutely historic. And Mr. President, I don't even think you fully comprehend the impact that you're having on the region in a way that is so remarkable. And it was your leadership, your foresight.\n\n(18:49)You did that when the B-2s went in, the celebration, the sense of partnership that you gave with the Israeli people was so dramatic, but the message was bigger than to Israel. It was a message to the world. America's friends can trust us, but America's foes had better fear us. And that is a message that the President sent to everyone on the planet, and it is a message that will resonate toward a matter of peace, the likes of which I don't think we've ever seen. So thank you.\n\nPresident Trump (19:24):\n\nThank you. Great job you're doing too.\n\nMike (19:25):\n\nThank you.\n\nPresident Trump (19:26):\n\nThey love you over there. They respect him and they love them. It's very, very interesting. We had the pilots here yesterday, as you know, and they were incredible. And we also had the mechanics, we had a lot of people here that had to do… I think about 170 people that had to do with that incredible journey. A journey that could have been horrible. You remember what happened with Jimmy Carter with the helicopters and all of the problems and ultimately hostages? We had the exact opposite. Everything was perfect, it worked perfectly. But I didn't realize, I was saying to one, \"Is this something that you felt strongly about?\"\n\n(20:06)\"Absolutely, sir, I couldn't wait.\" I said, \"Really better you than me.\" But they couldn't wait. He said, \"Sir, we've been practicing for this mission for more than 20 years.\" From just after 2000 they've been thinking and practicing to go into that area. I guess you probably know that better than anybody, Pete. They've been looking at going in, but they never had a president that would allow them to do it. And perhaps right, perhaps wrong. I don't know if that's true or not, but I didn't realize they were preparing for that journeys from just a little bit after 2000, the year 2000 and I was pretty amazed by that. They knew it. They knew every inch of it. And they came back and they said, \"We got it better than we ever did in practice.\" But they've been practicing for more than 20 years. Can you imagine? Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 12 (20:59):\n\nMr. President, are you planning to send more weapons to Ukraine?\n\nPresident Trump (21:03):\n\nWe're going to send some more weapons. They have to be able to defend themselves. They're getting hit very hard now. They're getting hit very hard. We're going to have to send more weapons. Yeah, defensive weapons primarily. But they're getting hit very, very hard. So many people are dying in that mess.\n\nSpeaker 10 (21:22):\n\nMr. President with the One Big Beautiful Bill now signed into law by you. What would you like congressional Republicans to turn their focus to now?\n\nPresident Trump (21:29):\n\nAll they have to do now is talk about how good it is. The biggest tax cuts ever. No tax on tips, no tax on social security. Think of it. No tax on overtime. From a business standpoint, the jobs are coming in like we've never seen them before. As soon as that was signed, there were nine factories that announced that they were building the one-year deductibility, things that from a business standpoint, you'd understand, the jobs that are being created. And one of the things that is, and this is also that, but it's also because of the tariffs, a tremendous success. We're taking in hundreds of billions of dollars in tariffs. One of the things that is so exciting is the number of companies and car companies where they're building plants, AI is the big thing. We have over $15 trillion announced already and, I mean, really I would say it is been during the last three months.\n\n(22:28)But we're here for a short period of time and some administrations never had anywhere near that number for a whole term, probably for a whole two terms. But we're up to over $15 trillion coming into our country. There's never been anything like it anywhere in the world. There's never been an investment like that anywhere in the world. I told this story and I just told it to Bibi backstage. I was talking to him and I said, \"The King of Saudi Arabia, smart guy.\" And also we went to Qatar and we went to UAE. Really three strong leaders, smart guys. They all told me the same thing. And then that was reiterated at NATO just recently when we got back where they agreed to spend a trillion dollars a year, by the way, which is about three times what they were spending. But they all said the same thing, \"We thought your country was dead.\" Horrible term, right?\n\n(23:22)\"We thought the United States of America was dead and now you're presiding over the hottest country anywhere in the world.\" We're the hottest country in the world. I think Bibi would admit it, even hotter than Israel, though Israel was pretty hot about a week ago, I can tell you, for the wrong reasons. But we are the hottest country in the world right now and it happened faster than anybody thought possible. But we have over $15 trillion, and that means jobs and that means building, and that means things like we've never seen before. So all we can do is keep working hard. There'll be always surprises. Some of the surprises are going to be bad surprises.\n\nSpeaker 11 (23:59):\n\nMr. President, again, real quick on Iran, in your view, is the war between Israel and Iran over or do those talks need to happen before you can-\n\nPresident Trump (24:10):\n\nWell, I would say that the best man to answer that is the Prime Minister. But I will tell you that in my view I hope it's over. Yeah, I think Iran wants to meet, I think they want to make peace, and I'm all for it. Now, if that's not the case, we are ready, willing, and able. But I don't think we're going to have to be. But I think Bibi would answer that question very well.\n\nBibi (24:33):\n\nI think the partnership between Israel and the United States, the partnership between President Trump and me produced a historic victory. It's an incredible victory, actually. It brought the greatest capabilities of the United States that are matched with the great capabilities of Israel and the Army of Israel, pilots of Israel, soldiers of Israel, and the Mossad. And the combination of these two extraordinary capacities produced a decisive result. It set back the two tumors that were threatening the life of Israel, the nuclear tumor, and the ballistic missile tumor because they were planning to build 20,000 of these things and launch it on a country the size of New Jersey. And no country could withstand that.\n\n(25:32)So what do you do when you have two things that are going to kill you? You have to remove them. With our combined effort, we did. But when you remove a tumor, it doesn't mean that it can't come back. You have to constantly monitor the situation to make sure that there's no attempt to bring it back. So we've had a great achievement and I think part of the effort of consolidating this and ensuring that we don't have to repeat this, is to monitor this carefully. Of course, the President and I are talking about it, our teams are talking about it. But there's no question this is a historic victory. And I think, as was said here today, this has already changed the face of the Middle East,\n\nSpeaker 11 (26:12):\n\nBut it's not over in your view?\n\nBibi (26:14):\n\nBut I think that there's an opportunity here to create a historic expansion of the Abraham Accords, which were themselves an act history that deserve a Nobel Prize for the President. But I think the opportunities are much bigger, and I hope, I'd like to believe that Iran would not test our fortitude because it would be a mistake. It's better to go a different way.\n\nSpeaker 11 (26:40):\n\nAnd do you believe that regime change is still necessary there?\n\nBibi (26:43):\n\nI think it's up to the people of Iran.\n\nSpeaker 11 (26:44):\n\nYou do.\n\nSpeaker 13 (26:46):\n\nMr. Prime Minister, speaking of that. On Syria, the Trump Administration was fully supportive of the changes in Syria, backing the new regime there. Obviously, your government more cautious from the security standpoint. Are you comfortable\n\nSpeaker 14 (27:00):\n\n… comfortable with the pace of change, with the security situation vis-a-vis Syria right now?\n\nBibi (27:07):\n\nI think there's an opportunity to explore. I think that everyone understands that the situation has changed. Before that, Iran was essentially running Syria. Okay? Directly through Hezbollah. Hezbollah has been brought to its knees. Iran is out of the picture. So I think this presents opportunities for stability, for security, and eventually for peace. And I think that's been opened up, also, by the fact that the president has opened up a channel so they have something. There's a lot to lose by going back to conflict. And there's a lot to gain by moving towards peace. And I think that opportunity has been opened by the president and by the changed security situation which we brought about with the collapse of the Assad regime.\n\nSpeaker 14 (28:03):\n\nAre there direct talks with the Assad government?\n\nBibi (28:05):\n\nNow, let's suppose there were. Would I answer yes? No. Right?\n\nSpeaker 14 (28:09):\n\nIt's my duty to ask. I appreciate it.\n\nBibi (28:12):\n\nIt's your duty to ask, it's my duty to ask you back.\n\nPresident Trump (28:15):\n\nAt the request of a lot of countries in the surrounding area of the Middle East, including Bibi, we took the sanctions off Syria and I met the new leader. I was very impressed by him. Somebody said, \"Well, he comes from a very tough background.\"\n\n(28:32)I said, \"Well, I'm not that surprised. It's a tough part of the world.\"\n\n(28:36)But I was very impressed by him. But we took the sanctions off because we want to give them a chance. They would never have had a chance without the sanctions. And one of the things we have with Iran is, we have very, they call it biting, they got very biting sanctions. And I would love to be able to, at the right time, take those sanctions off, give them a chance at rebuilding, because I'd like to see Iran build itself back up in a peaceful manner and not going around saying, \"Death to America, death to the USA, death to Israel,\" as they were doing. They were the bully of the Middle East and now they're not the bully anymore. But they were saying terrible things and I would like to see them… They have such potential. They have the oil power and they have great people, smart people, energetic people. Amazing.\n\n(29:21)And I know so many Iranians, Iranians from New York, I have a lot of friends and they're great people. So it's a shame when you see a thing like this happen. But I think that taking the sanctions off of Syria is going to give Syria a great shot at making it.\n\nReporters (29:36):\n\nMr. President [inaudible 00:29:38].\n\nSpeaker 15 (29:37):\n\nI have a follow-up on the congressional question. Are there any executive orders that you'd like to see Congress focus on when they come back in session? Do you have any that you prioritize to go first?\n\nPresident Trump (29:49):\n\nWell, we've done a lot of them in the last… As you know. And I always say, the great Big Beautiful Bill, I add the word \"great,\" but it was the largest bill of its kind ever passed. We were talking about it before, it was a beauty. But a lot of the things that we did, executive orders, have been codified in the legislation that we just had passed. And we're going to be sending it a lot more over the next period of about two months, separately. But a lot of it was part of that Beautiful Big Bill.\n\nSpeaker 16 (30:22):\n\nMr. President, on tariffs. What happened to 90 trade deals in 90 days as people are-\n\nPresident Trump (30:28):\n\nOh, we've spoken to everybody. It's all done. I told you. I told you we'll make some deals, but for the most part, we're going to send a letter, we're going to say, \"Welcome to the United States. If you'd like to participate in the greatest, most successful country ever.\" We're doing better than ever and you're going to see these numbers soon. We've never had numbers like this. We've never had investment like this. We have more than 90, we're going to have much more than 90. But most of those are going to be sent a letter. This is exactly what I said. Now we've made a deal with United Kingdom, we've made a deal with China, we're close to making a deal with India. Others we've met with and we don't think we're going to be able to make a deal, so we just send them a letter.\n\n(31:11)\"If you want to play ball, this is what you have to pay.\" So, as far as I'm concerned, we're done. We're sending out letters to various countries telling them how much tariffs they have to pay. Some will maybe adjust a little bit depending if they have a cause, we're not going to be unfair about it. And actually, it's a small fraction compared to what we should be getting. We could be asking for much more, but for the sake of relationships that we've had with a lot of really good countries, we're doing the way I do it. But we could be getting a lot more, we could ask for a lot more than what we're asking for.\n\nSpeaker 16 (31:48):\n\nWhen you say \"we're done\" because you're sending the letters, to follow up on [inaudible 00:31:53] asked earlier, you're accounting these as deals by saying, \"Here's the tariff rate we're going to-\"\n\nPresident Trump (31:58):\n\nI'm saying, \"Here it is. Congratulations. Welcome to the United States. I hope you make a lot of money and you're going to pay us money.\" They were charging us tariffs at levels that nobody has ever seen before. We have some countries that were charging 200% tariffs and making it impossible to do business. And what the tariffs are doing is, they're driving people in and companies into the United States. That's why we're building all of the work that you see happening in this country right now, and it's at a record level. All the factories, all of the AI institutions that are being built. Well, I think it's because of November 5th, the good election, and I think it's because of the tariffs. Thank you all very much. Thank you. Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 14 (32:40):\n\nThank you.\n\nSpeaker 16 (32:40):\n\nThank you.\n\nSpeaker 14 (32:43):\n\nWhat's for dinner?\n\nPresident Trump (32:44):\n\nI don't know, but it looks good to me.\n\nSpeaker 17 (32:46):\n\nIs it kosher?",

    "transcript": "President Trump (00:01):\n\nLadies and gentlemen, the President of the United States and First Lady, Melania Trump. Ladies and gentlemen, Master Gunnery Sergeant Kevin Bennear accompanied by the President's own United States Marine Band will now honor America with the singing of our national anthem, followed by a flyover consisting of a B-2 Spirit Bomber from Whiteman Air Force Base, escorted by two F-35 Fighters in honor of all our military personnel who participated in Operation Midnight Hammer and who are currently serving both home and abroad, protecting our nation's freedom.\n\nSpeaker 1 (01:57):\n\nWe hail'd at the twilight's last gleaming? Whose broad stripes and bright stars, thro' the perilous fight, O'er the ramparts we watch'd, were so gallantly streaming? And the rockets' red glare, the bombs bursting in air, Gave proof thro' the night that our flag was still there. O say, does that star‐spangled banner yet wave O'er the land of the free and the home of the brave?\n\nPresident Trump (05:02):\n\nLadies and gentlemen, the President of the United States and First Lady, Melania Trump.\n\nDonald Trump (05:15):\n\nWell, thank you very much and that is some sight, especially after what happened just a week ago when you look at that big, beautiful plane and the other ones were something. It was an incredible mission. And I think I can say very proudly, and I don't have to quote the polls, that our country is more proud right now than it's been in many, many years. We have pride, we have dignity. We have something that's happened miraculously so fast that our military now is the most sought after job there's ever been, serving in our military. One year ago, people didn't want to join our military. They didn't want to join our police, our firefighters, they didn't want to join anything having to do with our country and now, as you probably know, the enlistment, is it an all-time record. We're packed, we're full.\n\n(06:13)And I just think that's so important because that was so sad one year ago when I heard those statistics. We had a different President, but nobody wanted to join, and now we're at a record. And I will say that I just left NATO where we had a tremendous experience. They've agreed to put up over a trillion dollars a year. They went from less than 2% to 5% and nobody thought that was possible. And they told me very strongly, the leaders of a big part of the world, respected people all, they told me that one year ago, your country was dead and now you have the hottest country anywhere in the world. So that's the way it is, and that's the way we like it. And it's only going to get hotter, I promise you that.\n\n(07:02)After that spectacular display of American power, let me just say that God bless the United States military and God bless the USA, God bless the USA. And to all Americans, I want to wish you a very Happy Independence Day, Happy Fourth of July. This is going to be something special. This spirit in this country, we haven't seen anything like it in many, many years and decades. Let me also express our gratitude to our magnificent First Lady. She worked very hard to make this all work. We have a fireworks display about 9 o'clock tonight. I hope you're all going to be around and watch it. I know our congressmen and our senators who are standing right here, so many of them, they did such a great job, they're going to be here. I guarantee you they're not leaving. They're not leaving.\n\n(07:58)Thanks as well to the National Park Service, the USO, and countless friends and distinguished guests. We have so many people in the audience that have so much to do with the success of our country. We've, I think, had probably the most successful almost six months as a President and the Presidency, I think they're saying it was the best six months. And I know for a fact they're saying the last two weeks there has never been anything like it as far as winning, winning, winning. So as you know, two weeks ago, our incredible Air Force pilots conducted one of the most successful military strikes in all of history, Operation Midnight Hammer. And that's exactly what it was, it was a hammer. This evening, we're honored to be joined by 150 airmen and their families from Whiteman Air Force Base in Missouri, home of the B-2 Bomber.\n\nDonald Trump (09:02):\n\nAnd we've kept them a little bit on guard. We kept them a little bit, let's be a little bit quiet about it, but if you want to raise your hand very quickly, raise your hand because you people are just incredible. They don't want to be in disguise, you know they say, we don't have to do that. They're looking at us like we're a bunch of babies. We don't have to be in disguise. We saw all those hands go up. Thank you very much. We owe you everything. Great job. Incredible. Just flawless. One of the most flawless military campaigns in the history of our country. If you remember years ago, they had helicopters crashing into each other. It was a disaster, the hostages in Iran.\n\n(09:46)And we had just the opposite. We didn't have any crashes. We didn't lose any planes. We didn't lose anybody. Those beautiful planes that you saw were totally stealth. They flew right over the center of a very hostile country, and they never even saw it coming. And then they said, \"Skedaddle.\" They dropped the bombs, they said, \"Skedaddle.\" And that big sucker turned over like this on its side and it got out of there. Well, I'll tell you what, how they do that, but they can do it. I asked our great General, \"Caine, how did they do that? Do they really love doing that?\" Look at them. They're all laughing. And they said, \"Do they really like doing it?\" \"Sir, they can't wait.\" Better you than me. That's all I can say. It was a flawless mission. Every single bomb hit. And it was total obliteration. Total obliteration.\n\n(10:38)Now, even the fake news is admitting that, they hated to admit it, but they had no choice. That was an incredible thing. And these heroic pilots showed our enemies what it means to fly, fight, and win, to every service member who supported that mission, and we have many of them here, really, we've made you proud by supporting, but you've made us even prouder by having the courage to get in those gorgeous machines and fly through the roughest airspace anywhere in the world. And we salute you and we honor you. Thank you very much for being here. Thank you.\n\n(11:22)And we're also honored and delighted to be joined by hundreds of service members and military families. Those families are the best we have, from all across the U.S. Armed Forces, Army, Navy, Air Force, Space Force. I love the Space Force. You know why? Because we're the ones that did it. It's turned out to be a very invaluable force actually. The Coast Guard and the Marines are incredible people. On behalf of our entire nation, this 4th of July, we thank you for keeping America safe, strong, sovereign, and free. Thank you very much for being here. Great honor. And stick around for the fireworks. And our country's had so much to celebrate this Independence Day. As we enter our 249th year, America's winning, winning, winning, like never before. We're not… I'll tell you, we're in a category now that's where we've wanted to be for a long time.\n\n(12:19)We suffered with four horrible years of embarrassment. Afghanistan, maybe the most embarrassing moment in the history of our country. We're never going to let a thing like that happen again. Trillions of dollars are pouring into the United States for investment purposes. Almost $15 trillion, there's never been anything like it. There's never been anything even close. The stock market's at an all-time high, jobs are at an all-time high. Everything's at an all-time high. And we're going to keep it that way. We have the greatest country in the world, and we're back. We're back like nobody thought possible this quickly. I thought it would take maybe a year, maybe two years, maybe even three. And we did it in less than six months. We are back and strong. We've restored American strength and deterrence on the world stage. We're respected again. The world is respecting us again. When we did NATO, those leaders came up to me and they said, \"You know what? We're going to go to a new level of spending because you're requesting it, Sir.\"\n\n(13:22)They didn't talk to your last president like that, I can tell you. They didn't spend any money. They didn't spend anything. And a few moments, we're going to make official the greatest victory yet, when I signed the One Big Beautiful Bill. And before I start, I want to tell you that I've never seen people so happy in our country because of that. Because so many different groups of people are being taken care of, the military and civilians of all types, jobs of all types. We're adding things like the biggest tax cut in the history of our country, child tax credits. So many things are being added that we wouldn't even have time to discuss them. When we were doing it, John Thune and Mike Johnson right there, I see Mike, what a job they've done. What a job they've done.\n\n(14:18)But it was supposed to be in three, four, five, six or seven different bills. And I was in one of the fake news shows and I said, \"Let's do it in one beautiful big, we want one big beautiful bill.\" I said that to this newscaster, and I think a lot of the congressmen and senators were watching and they said, \"Let's name the bill that, the One Big Beautiful Bill.\" And that's what we did. And what we've done is put everything into one bill. It's never happened before. It's the biggest bill of its type in history. We've never had anything like that before. Nothing like that, they thought would be possible to get passed. And actually I liked it because we had so much in there that no matter who you are, there was something in that bill that would make your congressman, or your senator, or your congresswoman much more importantly, raise their hand and support, right Lisa?\n\n(15:14)So it was something, and it was really something special. So the American people gave us a historic mandate in November. We won everything. We won the swing states, all seven swing states. We won everyone. That rarely happens. We won the popular vote. We won the districts, 2,750 to 505. That's why when you look at a map, it's all red, a little blue on each end, but it's all red. And by the way, red means Republican, just in case. But we made promises and it's really promises made, promises kept and we've kept them. This is a triumph of democracy on the birthday of democracy. And I have to say that the people are happy. They're happy. And I listened to a broadcast and I read a couple of articles.\n\n(16:06)They have the Democrats, they should have voted for it. They didn't vote for tax cuts. They didn't vote for taking care of people. They didn't vote, not one vote. And we knew that because the hatred of either the country or me or both is so great. They didn't vote at all. And it's terrible. But I just have to say, they have a routine. It's terrible, they say, terrible, terrible. You saw that guy standing up for hours yesterday. He didn't know what he was even doing there. I say, \"When's he sitting down?\" He had a towel. He is wiping his face. That's not too elegant. But I said, \"What is he doing for so long?\" And he couldn't criticize the bill. He was criticizing everyone else and everything else. So they've developed, and this is according to the news media, they've developed a standard line and we can't let them get away with it. Oh, it's dangerous. Oh, everybody's going to die. It's actually just the opposite. Everybody's going to live. This is just the opposite.\n\n(17:03)And I just want you to know if you see anything negative put out by Democrats, it's all a con job. And they said, and they compared it to just like the con job of Russia, Russia, Russia and all of the other things they did. The 51 intelligence agents said, and the laptop from hell, \"It came from Russia,\" they said. No, it didn't come. A lot of things come from Russia. That didn't come from Russia. And it was all proven out to be a fake job. And that's what they're doing with this, so we just have to look forward, fellas, look forward and just say what it is because it's the most popular bill ever signed in the history of our country. Whether you're military or anybody else, this is the most single, most popular bill ever signed. And it includes the largest tax cut in American history. The largest spending cut $1.7 trillion, and yet you won't\n\nDonald Trump (18:00):\n\n… Even notice. It's just wastes fraud and abuse in American history. So you have the biggest tax cut, the biggest spending cut, the largest border security investment in American history. We want to have strong borders and the only thing is, we want to have great elections too. You need strong borders and elections. And my people have promised me that we're going to go into elections and we're going to make sure they're not rigged, that they're not sullied. We're going to make sure that the elections are going to be fair. You need two things. You need strong borders and you need fair elections, and we're going to make sure on the elections also, and our armed forces are one of the most vital military modernizations of all time. It will take place.\n\n(18:40)So we rebuilt our military in our first term, and now we're going to modernize and remodernize our military, including building a great golden dome all over our land so that if they get nasty with us, it's going to be knocked down. It's going to make any of the golden domes, they call them the iron domes, we're calling ours the Golden Dome because we did the iron domes and we do sort of everything if you want to know the truth, but this blows it away. We're going to keep you safe.\n\n(19:07)I want to thank every member of the House and Senate who worked to get this bill on my desk, and many of them are here. And I'm not going to mention all their names because we'll be standing here, but I have to mention a few and especially I want to thank Vice President J.D. Vance, who's been fantastic. Secretary of State, Marco Rubio, who's been incredible. We have somebody that it was a passion. I think he actually loved it. It wasn't easy, but he loved it, Speaker of the House, Mike Johnson, who's right here. Speaker, thank you very much. What a job. And he worked so closely with the Senate Majority Leader, John Thune, who's a fantastic guy. And those two, were a team that is not going to be beat. When you look at them and you look at their counterparts on the other side, it's not even close. I want to thank both of you people for doing an incredible job. Thank you very much, John and Mike.\n\n(20:07)House Majority Leader, Steve Scalise, a brave man. Steve, he suffered a tragedy number of years ago. I was at his hospital bedside that night with Melania with our First Lady and he had no chance. The doctor said he has very little chance and you look better today than you did then. You didn't look particularly good that night, I will say. But I learned one thing. His beautiful wife loved him. She was a disaster, right? I told him, I said, \"Steve, I can only tell you one thing. I was with your family and I was with your wife, and your wife was devastated. She loves you.\" I've seen a lot of wives that they don't seem to be so concerned in those situations. That's the kind of wife you don't want, but you have a great, beautiful wife who was really there and you really have done… You're a very brave guy and Mike and John and everybody that's standing with you knows it. Thank you very much. I really appreciate it.\n\n(21:02)House Majority Whip, this is a guy who is great. When I have a problem, I call him up and he gets it done. He's a tough cookie. I don't know why he's not the governor of Minnesota. He comes from Minnesota. He's like, \"Look…\" He goes, \"No, no, I don't want to run for governor.\" Come to think of it, I think that's a good idea. You would win so easily. The guy is terrible. You would win. You just have to take a look at that handsome face of yours and you'd win. Tom Emmer, everybody. He did a great job. I think you should consider that, Tom. Although, we don't want to lose him, do we? We don't want to. Stay where you are. I think stay where you are. What a job you did. And Senate Majority Whip, John Barrasso, who's incredible. Senate Finance Chairman, Mike Crapo, thank you, Mike. What a job. What a job. He knows that tax stuff. Him and Jason, they really know their stuff. Senate Budget Committee Chairman Lindsey Graham, what a good man he is.\n\n(22:01)I see a poll. He's running and I see a poll. He's 24 points up. That's not bad, Lindsey. That's not bad, 24 points up in the great state of South Carolina. House Ways and Means Chairman, Jason Smith, what a job. Thank you, Jason. Thank you. These people are great. These are great patriots. I have to call them out. House Budget Committee Chairman, Jodey Arrington. Jodey, thank you very much. Jodey has been good right from the beginning. And so many others, and they're all here and they fully understand. Probably they'll never speak to me again, but that's okay. It is what it is, but I just want to thank everybody. A lot of senators here, a lot of congressmen and women here. Lisa, thank you very much, by the way. I have to thank you. Thank you very much. You've been fantastic. So this bill will fuel massive economic growth and lift up the hardworking citizens who make this country run, the factory workers, farmers, mechanics, waiters, waitresses, police officers, firefighters, coal miners.\n\n(23:02)Coal is back beautiful. I said, you can't use the word coal unless you precede it by saying clean, beautiful coal. China is right now building 68 coal generating plants and we're putting up wind. Wind, it doesn't work, I will tell you, aside from ruining our fields and our valleys and killing all the birds and being very weak and very expensive, all made in China. I noticed something that, with all of the windmills that China sends us, where we waste our money because it's the most expensive energy, I see that they make about 95% of them, the wind turbines. I have never seen a wind farm in China. Why is that? Somebody check that out. Tom Emmer, would you please check that out? But all the coal miners we love and the truck drivers, in this act, we have officially made the Trump tax cuts permanent. That's the largest tax cut in the history of our country, added to substantial other cuts, which is going to… You're going to see like a rocket ship.\n\n(24:09)We're setting all sorts of economic records right now, and that's before this kicks in. After this kicks in, our country is going to be a rocket ship economically. And we've delivered no tax on tips, no tax on overtime, and no tax on social security for our great seniors. That's why, when you hear things like that, it's the biggest bill of its kind ever done by far. But we are going to have a situation. We are going to have something where people are going to realize the level of success and popularity of this bill. And to close it out, it makes the child tax credit permanent for 40 million American families and to increase the car affordability, it makes interest on a new car payment… So this had never happened before. You buy a car, you borrow money, you're allowed to deduct, for income tax purposes, your payment of interest, you're allowed to deduct it. It's never happened before. So run out and buy a car.\n\n(25:11)But I have to tell you, it's only good, Mike, if it's made in America. If it's made in another country, you don't get it. And to protect two million family farms and other small businesses, we're eliminating the estate tax or the death tax. So if you want to leave your farm or your small business… But the farms, really, they have been devastated… To your children. If you love your children… By the way, if you don't love your children, don't even listen to what I'm saying. It doesn't matter. But if you love, would you leave… Yes, I think you love your child. This one loves Barron. So I don't know if we're a small business. I think we're not. I'm not sure that we qualify. I'm sorry, darling. But it was devastating farmers. They had to go out and borrow money. And by the way, is that Pam Bondi? Pam Bondi, raise your hand. Thank you, Pam, for being here, Attorney General. She's done an incredible job. Think of this, there won't be any death tax. You're not going to have to go borrow money. Your parents pass away and the farm goes into the bank's hands and gets foreclosed. That's not going to happen. And with 100% expensing for new investments, we're cutting taxes for every manufacturer who builds, expands. And we have expansion at the highest level that we've ever had it. We have hundreds of factories, including car plants and AI. It's coming into our country at levels that we've never seen.\n\n(26:39)And to conclude, not only will we have the strongest economy on earth, we're also going to have the strongest borders on earth. And last month, did you see the number? Zero people crossed our border, zero illegal people. And that's after Joe Biden let 21 million people, many of them\n\nPresident Trump (27:00):\n\n… people from gangs and prisons and drug lords and people that were mentally unbalanced, they let them into our country. We're getting them out at record numbers and we have an obligation to, and we're doing it. So as we approach the 250th anniversary of America's founding exactly one year from now, we are creating an economy that delivers wealth for the middle class, a border that is sovereign and secure, and a military that is unmatched unequaled anywhere in the world and you saw that. And what a beautiful sight that was, especially after watching what they did just a short while ago.\n\n(27:37)The Golden Age of America is upon us. We are in the golden age. It's going to be a period of time, the likes of which I don't think this country has ever experienced before. We're going to make America great again and it's happening very fast. We love you. We thank you for being here, enjoy the fireworks tonight and First Lady, I want to thank you. You have been unbelievable. You think it's easy being First Lady? It's not.\n\n(28:02)Thank you all very much. Happy 4th of July. God bless you all. Thank you very much everybody.\n\n(28:08)We are going to sign the bill now.\n\nMUSIC (28:17):\n\n(Instrumental music.)\n\nPresident Trump (30:23):\n\nWell, that's a good one. That's a good one. That's a good one. Thank you. That was a good one. Wow.\n\n(30:34)Thank you all very much.\n\nGROUP (30:45):\n\nThank you, Mr. President.\n\n(30:46)Mr. President, this is the gavel we use to enact the Big Beautiful Bill. And I want you to have that for your [inaudible 00:31:26].\n\nPresident Trump (31:25):\n\nAre we ready?\n\nGROUP (31:25):\n\nWe're ready.\n\nPresident Trump (31:25):\n\nAre we ready?\n\nGROUP (31:25):\n\nWe're ready.\n\nPresident Trump (31:25):\n\nHave a good time everybody. Thank you very much.\n\n(31:25)28 points. It's a lot of points.\n\nGROUP (31:25):\n\nIt's a lot of points.\n\n(31:25)Good job.\n\nPresident Trump (31:25):\n\nRichard, thank you.\n\n(31:25)Absolutely. And we have some more, we'll give you some more.\n\nGROUP (31:26):\n\nThank you, Mr. President.\n\n(31:27)Give that guy a raise.\n\nPresident Trump (31:44):\n\nThank you very much everybody. And I want to thank the people up here, they're unbelievable people. Mary, hi Mary.\n\nGROUP (31:50):\n\nThank you.\n\nPresident Trump (31:51):\n\nHow's Scott doing? Good job? Scott, how's the economy? Okay?\n\nGROUP (31:55):\n\nWonderful job. Starting to get better.\n\nPresident Trump (31:56):\n\nFrom South Carolina, it's been amazing.\n\n(31:59)Thank you very much everybody, have a good time. Happy 4th of July.\n\nGROUP (32:06):\n\nHappy 4th.",

    "transcript": "President Donald Trump (00:00):\n\nHello, fellas. It's been a big weekend. See you in the plane.\n\nSecretary General Mark Rutte (00:11):\n\nThey're with you on the planes?\n\nPresident Donald Trump (00:14):\n\nThey travel all the time. They have better seats than I do.\n\nReporters (00:15):\n\nMr. President, [inaudible 00:00:20] your goals for NATO and Article 5 today?\n\nPresident Donald Trump (00:23):\n\nWe're with them all the way. I mean, if you take a look at the numbers, we're with them, and they're very big things to announce today. I don't know if you've taken the vote or you're going to take the vote, but I've been asking them to go up to 5% for a number of years and they're going up to 5%. That's a big from 2% and a lot of people didn't even pay the 2%. So I think that's going to be very big news. NATO is going to become very strong with us and I appreciate doing it. Perhaps you want to talk about-\n\nSecretary General Mark Rutte (00:57):\n\nYeah, absolutely. First before we go to spending, I just want to recognize your decisive action on Iran.\n\nPresident Donald Trump (00:58):\n\nThank you.\n\nSecretary General Mark Rutte (00:59):\n\nYou are a man of strength, but you're also a man of peace, and the fact that you are now also successful in getting this ceasefire done between Israel and Iran, I really want to commend you for that, and I think this is important for the whole world. Then on spending, it's absolutely true. I want to state here, without President Trump, this would not have happened. In three stages. When you became president in 2016, 2017, you forced Europeans, Canadians to pay more. At this moment, result of that phase is 1 trillion extra aggregate defense spending by the Canadians and the Europeans. Then came phase two when you became president in January last year. Phase two is that all the countries not yet on 2% have now committed to the 2%. This is the old goal from Wales in 2014. Seven were not on 2%, some were in the 2030s.\n\n(01:51)Now this year, all of them, including Canada, including Italy, including Belgium, they have all now committed to the 2% and now comes the big splash. Today we will decide to go to 5%. We have to keep ourselves safe for our adversaries, but also because it is fair to equalize with the United States. With this 5%, the Europeans and the Canadians will equalize their defense spending with the United States. So this is not about American taxpayers paying more, this is about Europeans, Canadians paying more. And again, this would not have happened… I'm really saying this here and some people might criticize me, but then when I speak with them, they all say, \"Yes, you are right.\" This would not have happened if you would not have been elected in 2016 and re-elected last year and back into office in January. So I'm also saying-\n\nPresident Donald Trump (02:40):\n\nWell, thank you very much. It's a great victory for everybody, I think, and we will be equalized very shortly and that's the way it has to be. It's going to be a lot of money too, a lot of defense.\n\nSecretary General Mark Rutte (02:49):\n\nIt's trillions extra.\n\nPresident Donald Trump (02:50):\n\nYeah, and we have a great relationship and we've had a great relationship from the beginning. Highly respected man. And yeah, we appreciate you being here too, everybody. We really do. We have a tremendous group of people on my left and a tremendous group of people on my right. They might be even better than my people. Let's have a fight. Let's figure it out. Anyway. But we appreciate it and we've had a tremendous relationship, Mark and I, and we've really worked on this subject for a long time. When Biden was here, it just died. Just died like everything else died. And now it's… You're going to take, I guess a vote today, right?\n\nSecretary General Mark Rutte (03:29):\n\nAbsolutely. Today we will decide unanimously to do this. That's my absolute conviction.\n\nPresident Donald Trump (03:34):\n\nSo we can't talk about it until the vote's taken because sometimes strange things happens with, but I think you're going to get-\n\nSecretary General Mark Rutte (03:41):\n\nI'm not too worried. I'm not too worried.\n\nPresident Donald Trump (03:43):\n\nI think you're going to do very well. Everyone's very happy about it. Go ahead. Yes?\n\nReporters (03:45):\n\nMr. President, how is the Iran-Israel ceasefire going in your opinion?\n\nPresident Donald Trump (03:49):\n\nI think very good. I think very good. Israel came back yesterday. I was so proud of them because they came back. They went out because they felt it was a violation and technically they were right, but it just wouldn't have worked out very well, and they brought the planes back. They had gone on to another journey because there was a little bit of a violation, and I said, \"You got to get them back,\" and they came back and it was a great thing. And it is going very well.\n\nReporters (04:15):\n\nMr. President, what is your response to the foreign minister saying he still wants to enrich nuclear?\n\nPresident Donald Trump (04:20):\n\nHello, Katie. She's so great, this one. Any questions she asks I'll answer. Well, maybe I better not say that. What was your question?\n\nReporters (04:28):\n\nWhat is your response to the Iranian foreign minister continuing to say Iran will enrich uranium and pursue nuclear weapons?\n\nPresident Donald Trump (04:35):\n\nWell, I don't know if they've said that, but I'll tell you the last thing they want to do is enrich anything right now. They want to recover and we won't let that happen, number one. Militarily, we won't. I think we'll end up having somewhat of a relationship with Iran. I see it. Look, I've had a relationship over the last four days. They agreed to ceasefire and it was a very equal agreement. They both said that's enough. They both said it. But no, they won't do that. The last thing they want to do, Katie, is enrich. They're not looking to… Can you imagine after all that they've got to say, \"Oh, let's go and do a bomb.\"? There could be a day in the future and then somebody else taking our place will be saying, \"Don't do it,\" and maybe they won't do it as well, I don't know, but they're not going to have a bomb and they're not going to enrich. And we believe all of the stuff is down there.\n\n(05:24)We don't think they had nearly the time because to get that out as a very difficult thing. It's not like moving a package or taking this carpet up and moving it. It's very difficult. It's very dangerous to do. We believe it's all down there. We had a tremendous victory, a tremendous hit, and because of that, I don't think they would've been down there, because they knew we were coming. When they knew we're coming, they're not going to be down in that 30 stories underground. So no, I think it was just a tremendous victory for everybody, including Iran. Look, they've got a country and they've got oil and they're very smart people and they can come back. Israel got hit very hard, especially the last couple of days. Israel was hit really hard. Those ballistic missiles, boy, they took out a lot of buildings and they've been great. Bibi Netanyahu should be very proud of himself. And they've really been great, but they're not going to be building bombs for a long time.\n\nReporters (06:21):\n\nMr. President, what's your reaction to the intelligence reports saying that the Iranian nuclear sites were only partially devastated, not entirely?\n\nPresident Donald Trump (06:30):\n\nYeah. Well, they said it was… Actually, the report said it could have been very… They don't know. I mean, they did a report. I could have Pete talk to it because his department did the report. They really don't know. I think Israel's going to be telling us very soon because Bibi is going to have people involved in that whole situation. We hear it was obliteration. It was a virtual obliteration. When you take a look at the ground above… Don't forget, the flame is all underground. But everything above, if you look at the before and the after picture, everything above is burned black, the trees, everything. There's one building, but that's a building that sunk substantially into the granite so that the fire goes right over it.\n\n(07:14)I believe it was total obliteration. I believe they didn't have a chance to get anything out because we acted fast. If it would've taken two weeks maybe, but it's very hard to remove that kind of material. Very hard and very dangerous for them to remove it. Plus they knew we were coming, and if they know we're coming, they're not going to be down there. There aren't too many people that are going to be down there. Pete, do you have something to say about that?\n\nPete Hegseth (07:37):\n\nWell, Mr. President, when you talk to the people who built the bombs, understand what those bombs can do and deliver those bombs, they landed precisely where they were supposed to. It was a flawless mission. Right down where we knew they needed to enter. And given the 30,000 pounds of explosives and capability of those munitions, it was devastation underneath Fordow, and the amount of munitions, six per location, any assessment that tells you it was something otherwise is speculating with other motives. And we know that because when you actually look at the report… By the way, it was a top secret report. It was preliminary, it was low confidence, all right? You make assessments based on what you know, they don't-\n\nPresident Donald Trump (08:20):\n\nAnd it said it could be very devastating, very serious.\n\nPete Hegseth (08:22):\n\nModerate to severe, and we believe far more likely severe and obliterated. So this is a political motive here.\n\nReporters (08:29):\n\nIs there a leak investigation?\n\nPete Hegseth (08:30):\n\nOf course, we're doing a leak investigation with the FBI right now because this information is for internal purposes, battle damage assessments, and CNN and others are trying to spin it to make the president look bad. When this was an overwhelming success.\n\nPresident Donald Trump (08:43):\n\nWe had a tremendous success. And this is the New York Times. I call it the failing New York Times. It's going to hell. And CNN, which as you know, very few people are watching. And you would think they'd do the opposite. You would think they'd want to say this was an unbelievable success, and the thing that hurts me is it's really demeaning to the pilots and the people that put that whole thing together, the generals. That was a perfect operation. And when you look at the holes… And this was done from 52,000 feet, there was no moon, there was no light, and those three holes are right together.\n\n(09:17)And also, and nobody talks about this, we shot 30 Tomahawks from submarines. In particular one submarine, but that was 400 miles away. And every one of those Tomahawks hit within a foot of where they were supposed to hit. Took out a lot of buildings that Israel wasn't able to get. We took them out with Tomahawks. We don't even talk about that. This was a devastating attack and it knocked them for a loop. And if it didn't, they wouldn't have settled. If they had won, if we didn't take it out, they wouldn't have settled. Somebody mentioned that to me last night, if that thing wasn't devastated, they would've never settled. Marco, do you have something?\n\nMarco Rubio (09:57):\n\nYeah. First of all, on the stuff about the intelligence, this is what a leaker is telling you the intelligence says. That's the game these people play. They read it and then they go out and characterize it the way they want it characterized and they're leakers. This is the game they play. So that's number one. Number two, here's a fact. The conversion facility, which you can't do a nuclear weapon without a conversion facility. We can't even find where it used to be on the map. You can't even find where it used to be because the whole thing is just blackened out. It's gone.\n\nPresident Donald Trump (10:23):\n\nIt's wiped out.\n\nMarco Rubio (10:24):\n\nIt's wiped out. Then we dropped 12 of the strongest bombs on the planet right down the hole in two places. Everything underneath that mountain is in bad shape. And I refer you to the statement of the IAEA, Mr. Grossi. You know what he said? He said there was Iran the way it looked the day before the attack and what their nuclear program looks like now, two very different things. They are way behind where they were just seven days ago. Now, anything in the world can be rebuilt, but now we know where it is and if they try to rebuild it, we'll have options there as well. But all this leaker stuff… These leakers are professional stabbers. That's what they are. They go out and they read this stuff and then they tell you what it says against the law, but they characterize it for you in a way that's absolutely false. There's no way Iran comes to the table if somehow nothing had happened. This was complete and total obliteration. They're in bad shape. They are way behind today compared to where they were just seven days ago because of what the president did.\n\nSecretary General Mark Rutte (11:16):\n\nMarco, can I just alert you to one other aspect? So the great thing is you took out the nuclear capability of Iran. This was crucial. You did it in a way which is extremely impressive, but the signal sends to the rest of the world that this president, when it comes to it, yes, he's man of peace, but if necessary he's willing to use strength, the enormous strength of the American military. So I think that signal to the rest of the world, this is far beyond Iran, is extremely important. So let me also point out to that aspect of what happens.\n\nPresident Donald Trump (11:48):\n\nIran went down to the site afterwards. They said it's so devastated and they settled when they saw what we did to it. And frankly, if we didn't do that, they would've had a lot of ammunition to keep going. They wouldn't have settled. Somebody brought that up and two Iranians went down to see it and they called back and they said, \"This place is gone.\" So it's just fake news by CNN, which has got no ratings. It's a failed network. Anybody here from CNN by the way? Because you're really disgraceful network. MSNBC I think is actually worse. But they're all pretty bad. But yours is good, Katie. I'll tell you. You know what? Marco reminded me that he did such a nice job there. It was nine years ago. I had to debate this guy. He was not easy. I think he even got better. But when you were into your little thing, I said, \"This is when I had to debate this guy.\" You think it's easy to debate him? It's not easy.\n\nReporters (12:43):\n\nHow long do you think that the Iranian nuclear program has been put back by these strikes? Years? Totally… What?\n\nPresident Donald Trump (12:51):\n\nI think basically decades because I don't think they'll ever do it again. I just don't think they're going to do it. I think they're going to take their oil, they're going to have some missiles and they'll have some defense. I think they've had it. I mean, they just went through hell. I think they've had it. The last thing they want to do is enrich. They've been trying to do it… By the way, it's hard to enrich. And when you look at a site like that, very, very hard to build. Very, very hard. Very expensive. They spent trillions of dollars trying to do this thing and they didn't come up with it. And we're actually getting along with them very well right now. But had we not succeeded with that hit… That hit ended the war. That hit ended the war. I don't want to use an example of Hiroshima. I don't want to use an example of Nagasaki, but that was essentially the same thing. That ended that war. This ended that with a war. If we didn't take that out, they'd be fighting right now.\n\nReporters (13:47):\n\nMr. President, if the Iranians do rebuild, would the United States strike again? And I have also a question about Russia.\n\nPresident Donald Trump (13:55):\n\nSure, but we're not going to have to worry about that. It's gone for years. Years. It's very tough to rebuild because the whole thing has collapsed. In other words, inside it's all collapsed. Nobody can get in to see it because it's collapsed. You can't go in to see a room that has 10 million tons of rock in it. And the tunnels are totally collapsed.\n\nReporters (14:17):\n\nBut if they rebuild.\n\nPresident Donald Trump (14:17):\n\nWell, they've already looked at the tunnels that… This was an unbelievable hit by genius pilots and genius people in the military, and they're not being given credit for it because we have scum that's in this group… And not all of you are. You have some great reporters, but you have scum. CNN is scum. MSDNC is scum. The New York Times is scum. They're bad people. They're sick. And what they've done is they're trying to make this unbelievable victory into something less. Now, even they admit that it was hit very hard, but it wasn't hit hard, it was hit brutally and it knocked it out. The original word that I used, I guess it got us in trouble because it's a strong word, it was obliteration. And you'll see that and it's going to come out. Israel is doing a report on it now, I understand, and I was told that they said it was total obliteration. They have guys that go in there after the hit and they say it was total obliteration.\n\n(15:19)And I don't want it for me. I want it for the pilots. I want it for the military. They did such a good job. If you were in the situation room with me with the generals and all of the people that did such a good job, and then they get demeaned by these idiots at CNN who can't get ratings… The place is dying. Nobody wants to even waste their time going on their shows. So they form with the New York Times, who's dying also. Without Trump, you wouldn't have a New York Times.\n\nReporters (15:43):\n\nAnd then just changing gears to your meeting with Zelenskyy later today. Can you give us any preview of what the two of you might be discussing?\n\nPresident Donald Trump (15:51):\n\nNo. Well, we'll discuss the obvious. We'll discuss his difficulties. He's got a little difficulty, Zelenskyy. He's a nice guy. I mean, I'm going to meet him today. I don't know. I assume we're going to be discussing Ukraine. I mean, it seems like the most likely subject.\n\nReporters (16:10):\n\nAny restart to the talks there or anything that you might do?\n\nPresident Donald Trump (16:11):\n\nWell, we're going to see, I mean I've spoken to Putin a lot and he actually was very nice. He volunteered help on, as you know, on Iran. I said, \"No, I don't need help on Iran. I need help on Russia.\" I said, \"Do me a favor, help us on Russia, not Iran.\" But he was very nice. We're going to talk about that. We're going to talk. I think progress is being made. I think great progress is being made on Gaza. I think because of this attack that we made, I think we're going to have some very good news. I was talking to Steve Witkoff, who by the way, is terrific and who knows more about this subject than anybody, the subject of what we were just talking about. He was on last night with Jesse and with Laura and with Sean, and boy, Susie has a great take on it. He just explains it so easily. He's really very knowledgeable. But he did tell me that Gaza is very close.\n\nReporters (17:09):\n\nOne follow up on Iran. Both you and Secretary Rubio and Hegseth mentioned the leak, but can you clarify, is the intelligence correct or is the intelligence wrong?\n\nPresident Donald Trump (17:18):\n\nWell, the intelligence was very inconclusive. The intelligence says we don't know. It could have been very severe. That's what the intelligence says. So I guess that's correct, but I think we can take the we don't know. It was very severe. It was obliteration. And you think that a media outlet would say, \"Isn't that a great thing?\" I mean, more importantly for the military, you take their guts out, you take their absolute guts out. They had a tremendous attack. It was a complete obliteration. The other team, the other group, Iran, said, \"Let's stop this.\" And you know what? Israel said it too. Very smart. They fought like hell and then they said, \"Let's stop,\" and they're going to build themselves, and I really see it as sticking… I mean, we may do papers on it, Marco. Maybe we're going to do papers. I don't even know if you need them. They're not going to be fighting each other. They've had it. They've had a big fight. Like two kids at a schoolyard, they fight like hell. You can't stop them. Let them fight for about two, three minutes. Then it's easy to stop them.\n\nSecretary General Mark Rutte (18:24):\n\nAnd then daddy has to sometimes do strong language to get them to stop.\n\nPresident Donald Trump (18:28):\n\nStrong language. Every once in a while you have to use a certain word.\n\nSecretary General Mark Rutte (18:30):\n\nI think we have to join the other [inaudible 00:18:31].\n\nPresident Donald Trump (18:32):\n\nYes. We're going to join some other group. Yes, thank you. Katie, one other?\n\nReporters (18:34):\n\nOne last question. Do you believe-\n\nPresident Donald Trump (18:36):\n\nShe's so good.\n\nReporters (18:38):\n\nThank you, Mr. President.\n\nPresident Donald Trump (18:39):\n\nShe used to be very difficult. Go ahead.\n\nReporters (18:42):\n\nDo you believe that this strike on the Iranian nuclear program will lead to the release of the hostages in Gaza?\n\nPresident Donald Trump (18:49):\n\nI think that it helped a little bit. It showed a lot of power. Yeah, I think it helped. But we're going to get… Separately, even before this, we were very close to making a deal on Gaza. I think this helped, yes. Okay. Thank you, Katie. Thank you, everybody. Thank you.",

    "transcript": "President Trump (00:55):\n\nThank you very much. A short time ago, the U.S. military carried out massive precision strikes on the three key nuclear facilities in the Iranian regime Fordo, Natanz and Isfahan. Everybody heard those names for years as they built this horribly destructive enterprise. Our objective was the destruction of Iran's nuclear enrichment capacity and a stop to the nuclear threat posed by the world's number one state sponsor of terror. Tonight, I can report to the world that the strikes were a spectacular military success. Iran's key nuclear enrichment facilities have been completely and totally obliterated. Iran, the bully of the Middle East must now make peace. If they do not, future attacks will be far greater and a lot easier. For 40 years, Iran has been saying, \"Death to America, death to Israel.\" They have been killing our people, blowing off their arms, blowing off their legs with roadside bombs. That was their specialty. We lost over 1,000 people and hundreds of thousands throughout the Middle East and around the world have died as a direct result of their hate in particular. So many were killed by their general, Qasem Soleimani.\n\n(02:25)I decided a long time ago that I would not let this happen. It will not continue. I want to thank and congratulate Prime Minister Bibi Netanyahu. We worked as a team, like perhaps no team has ever worked before, and we've gone a long way to erasing this horrible threat to Israel. I want to thank the Israeli military for the wonderful job they've done. And most importantly, I want to congratulate the great American patriots who flew those magnificent machines tonight and all of the United States military on an operation the likes of which the world has not seen in many, many decades. Hopefully, we will no longer need their services in this capacity. I hope that's so. I also want to congratulate the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, General Dan \"Razin\" Caine, spectacular general, and all of the brilliant military minds involved in this attack.\n\n(03:22)With all of that being said, this cannot continue. There will be either peace or there will be tragedy for Iran far greater than we have witnessed over the last eight days. Remember, there are many targets left. Tonight's was the most difficult of them all by far, and perhaps the most lethal. But if peace does not come quickly, we will go after those other targets with precision, speed and skill. Most of them can be taken out in a matter of minutes. There's no military in the world that could have done what we did tonight. Not even close. There has never been a military that could do what took place just a little while ago. Tomorrow, General Caine, Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth will have a press conference at 8:00 AM at the Pentagon, and I want to just thank everybody and in particular, God, I want to just say we love you God, and we love our great military, protect them. God bless the Middle East, God bless Israel and God bless America. Thank you very much. Thank you.",

    "transcript": "UK Prime Minster Keir Starmer (00:06):\n\nYes, sir.\n\nSpeaker 2 (00:07):\n\nPull camera. Pull camera.\n\nPresident Donald J. Trump (00:16):\n\nOkay. Thank you very much. We all know the great Prime Minister of the UK, and we just signed a document. This is… Whoop. Sorry about that.\n\nUK Prime Minster Keir Starmer (00:25):\n\nA very important document.\n\nPresident Donald J. Trump (00:33):\n\nA little windy out here. Give me that. We just signed it and it's done. And so, we have our trade agreement with the European Union. And it's a fair deal for both, and it produces a lot of jobs, a lot of income, and we have many, many other ones coming. But you see the level of enthusiasm is very good. But the relationship that we have is fantastic, so I just want to congratulate you.\n\nUK Prime Minster Keir Starmer (01:00):\n\nWell, Donald, thank you very much. This now implements on car tariffs and aerospace, and a really important agreement. And so, this is a very good day for both of our countries, a real sign of strength. So thank you again, Donald, a really important day for both of us.\n\nPresident Donald J. Trump (01:15):\n\nGreat people, great people.\n\nSpeaker 2 (01:16):\n\nHas anyone exchanged in any agreement since you spoke on the phone from the Oval Office?\n\nPresident Donald J. Trump (01:25):\n\nNot much. This is it.\n\nUK Prime Minster Keir Starmer (01:25):\n\nThis is implemented.\n\nSpeaker 4 (01:25):\n\nWhich deal is it? Was this deal made today?\n\nSpeaker 5 (01:25):\n\nMr. President, may I ask you a question please? Do you sir, believe there's accordance of deescalation of Israel and Iran, but you are the key to unlocking that.\n\nPresident Donald J. Trump (01:34):\n\nThat's right. And here I am.\n\nSpeaker 5 (01:35):\n\nAnd here you are.\n\nPresident Donald J. Trump (01:36):\n\nYeah.\n\nSpeaker 5 (01:36):\n\nSo can I ask you, sir, have you spoken to Prime Minister Netanyahu? When might you speak to him?\n\nPresident Donald J. Trump (01:44):\n\nI've spoken to everybody.\n\nSpeaker 6 (01:45):\n\nWhat will you say?\n\nPresident Donald J. Trump (01:46):\n\nIsrael is very, very well, as you probably noticed. And I gave Iran 60 days, and they said no. And the 61st, you saw what happened, day 61. So I'm in constant touch. And as I've been saying, I think a deal will be signed or something will happen, but a deal will be signed. And I think Iran is foolish not to sign one.\n\nSpeaker 2 (02:15):\n\nMr. President, Iran is accusing Netanyahu of attacking them to deliberately derail your nuclear plan that you had. What do you say to that? Do you think that's true?\n\nPresident Donald J. Trump (02:26):\n\nNo, no. Look, Iran should have signed the deal.\n\nSpeaker 2 (02:28):\n\nIf it would help bring Iran to the negotiating table, would you guarantee that the US would not get involved militarily?\n\nPresident Donald J. Trump (02:33):\n\nWell, I think this. I think Iran basically is at the negotiating table. They want to make a deal. And as soon as I leave here, we're going to be doing something. But I have to leave here. I have this commitment. I have a lot of commitments. I have a commitment to a lot of countries, including the UK where we just signed our deal.\n\nSpeaker 6 (02:57):\n\nMr. President, about the Ukraine, Mr. President, when will-\n\nSpeaker 7 (02:57):\n\nMr. President, where are you settling on steel? Is that going to zero or are they staying-\n\nPresident Donald J. Trump (02:58):\n\nWe're going to let you have that information in a little while.\n\nSpeaker 6 (03:03):\n\nOn Russia/Ukraine… On US/Russia talks, when will they start?\n\nPresident Donald J. Trump (03:05):\n\nThey're starting already.\n\nSpeaker 6 (03:05):\n\nToday?\n\nSpeaker 8 (03:07):\n\nMr. President, do you agree to the Europeans pose to apply more sanctions on Russia. Does the US support that?\n\nPresident Donald J. Trump (03:15):\n\nWell, Europe is saying that, but they haven't done it yet. Let's see them do it first.\n\nSpeaker 2 (03:19):\n\nYou told me earlier that you could sanction Russia. Why wait? Why wait to sanction them?\n\nPresident Donald J. Trump (03:24):\n\nBecause I'm waiting to see whether or not a deal is there.\n\nSpeaker 9 (03:27):\n\nCan you guarantee the UK won't be suffering?\n\nPresident Donald J. Trump (03:28):\n\nYou forget. Sanctions cost us a lot of money. When I sanction a country, that costs the US a lot of money, a tremendous amount of money. It's not just let's sign a document. You're talking about billions and billions of dollars. Sanctions are not that easy. It's not just a one-way street.\n\nSpeaker 2 (03:45):\n\nAnd just quickly, do you think that Israel can-\n\nSpeaker 10 (03:51):\n\nMr. President, on the AUKUS submarine agreement, is that still proceeding? If you can sort of give a view of that.\n\nUK Prime Minster Keir Starmer (03:53):\n\nYep. We're proceeding with that. It's a really important deal to both of us. I think the President is doing a review. We did a review when we came into it, so that makes good sense to me. But it's a really important-\n\nPresident Donald J. Trump (04:02):\n\nWe're very longtime partners and allies and friends, and we've become friends in a short period of time. He's slightly more liberal than I am, to put it mildly.\n\nUK Prime Minster Keir Starmer (04:11):\n\nWell, we stand slightly on the left.\n\nPresident Donald J. Trump (04:14):\n\nFor some reason, we get along.\n\nUK Prime Minster Keir Starmer (04:15):\n\nWe make it work.\n\nSpeaker 2 (04:16):\n\nMr. President, did you just say that Ukraine would get in the way of arming Israel?\n\nSpeaker 10 (04:21):\n\nThere's quite a few British soldiers who worry you side more with the Russians over deep end war. Can you reassure this-\n\nPresident Donald J. Trump (04:28):\n\nNo, I don't, no, no. You know what I side on? Saving lives. I only care about saving lives. We have nothing to do with it except that Biden stupidly let us get into that mess and gave him $350 billion, $350 billion. And yet, despite that, you saw how we did in the Middle East. We took it $5.1 trillion. We have $15 trillion almost, looking around that number, going to be invested in the US. So the money is not the thing in this case. It's 5,000 young people are being killed every week in Russia, Ukraine. And if I can stop that, I'll be very happy. They're Ukrainian and they're Russian. So you could say, \"what am I doing?\" But I'd like to see if I could stop it.\n\nSpeaker 2 (05:10):\n\nDo you think that Israel can fully eliminate the threat that Iran poses, this nuclear threat that they pose without the United States military help?\n\nPresident Donald J. Trump (05:18):\n\nWho said that?\n\nSpeaker 2 (05:18):\n\nNo. I'm asking if you believe they can without the help of the US?\n\nPresident Donald J. Trump (05:21):\n\nWell, it's irrelevant. Something's going to happen.\n\nSpeaker 2 (05:23):\n\nHave you spoken to the-\n\nSpeaker 11 (05:23):\n\nMr. President, would you consider traveling to the Mid East as part of any talks if it would help broker a deal?\n\nPresident Donald J. Trump (05:29):\n\nYeah. Yeah, but I think we're doing pretty well. We're talking.\n\nSpeaker 11 (05:31):\n\nYou don't think you-\n\nPresident Donald J. Trump (05:32):\n\nWe have a thing called the telephone, so we're talking. But it's always better to talk in person.\n\nSpeaker 8 (05:38):\n\nMr. President, do you want to see regime change in Iran?\n\nPresident Donald J. Trump (05:42):\n\nI want to see no nuclear weapon in Iran. And we're well on our way to making sure that happens.\n\nUK Prime Minster Keir Starmer (05:50):\n\nAnd we've had a discussion about that morning, in the G7, absolute clarity in relation to the nuclear program. We do not want to see it.\n\nSpeaker 6 (05:54):\n\nMr. President, you have a response-\n\nSpeaker 10 (05:59):\n\nMr. President, can you guarantee the UK will be protected from any future tariffs?\n\nPresident Donald J. Trump (06:01):\n\nWhat?\n\nSpeaker 10 (06:01):\n\nCan you guarantee the UK will be protected from any future tariffs?\n\nPresident Donald J. Trump (06:03):\n\nThe UK is very well-protected. You know why? Because I like them. That's why. That's their ultimate protection. Thank you very much. The Prime Minister has done a great job. I want to just tell that to the people of the United Kingdom. He's done a very, very good job. He's done what other people, they've been talking about this deal for six years/.\n\nUK Prime Minster Keir Starmer (06:22):\n\nSix years.\n\nPresident Donald J. Trump (06:23):\n\nAnd he's done what they haven't been able to do, so he's done really a very good job.\n\nSpeaker 2 (06:30):\n\nDo you have any response to Tucker Carlson criticizing you saying that you were complicit in the war?\n\nPresident Donald J. Trump (06:32):\n\nI don't know what Tucker Carlson is saying. Let him go get a television network and say it so that people listen.\n\nSpeaker 2 (06:39):\n\nAnd quickly-\n\nPresident Donald J. Trump (06:39):\n\nThank you.\n\nUK Prime Minster Keir Starmer (06:40):\n\nThank you.\n\nSpeaker 2 (06:40):\n\nHave you spoken to Zelensky before your bi lapses?\n\nSpeaker 7 (06:40):\n\nAny more trade deals to comment, Mr. President?\n\nPresident Donald J. Trump (06:42):\n\nYeah, a lot of them.\n\nSpeaker 2 (06:43):\n\nJapan?\n\nPresident Donald J. Trump (06:44):\n\nA lot of them. Good happened.\n\nSpeaker 2 (06:44):\n\nGood happened?\n\nSpeaker 11 (06:45):\n\nHow did it go with the Japanese, sir?",

    "transcript": "Speaker 1 (00:03):\n\nAll right. Just relax. We're walking in. Just relax. [inaudible 00:00:11].\n\nSpeaker 2 (00:04):\n\nOne second, sir. Just one second. Can you get everybody in? [inaudible 00:00:25]\n\nSpeaker 1 (00:04):\n\nOkay, you're in. Peter?\n\nSpeaker 2 (00:29):\n\nAre we good to go, sir?\n\nMark Carney (00:29):\n\nAre we good to go?\n\nSpeaker 2 (00:31):\n\nGo ahead, sir.\n\nMark Carney (00:32):\n\nAll right. Thank you. Mr. President, welcome to Canada.\n\nDonald Trump (00:35):\n\nThank you very much.\n\nMark Carney (00:36):\n\nIt's a great honor. Happy birthday.\n\nDonald Trump (00:38):\n\nThank you.\n\nMark Carney (00:39):\n\nA few days short.\n\nDonald Trump (00:40):\n\nA little bit.\n\nMark Carney (00:40):\n\nA few days short, but didn't have a chance to see you on the day. Happy birthday to the U.S. Military as well, 250th. And this is the 50th birthday, if you will, of the G7. This marks the 50th birthday of the G7. And the G7 is nothing without U.S. leadership and your personal leadership, the leadership of the United States, many issues, geopolitics, economic, technology, and working hand in hand with the United States, Canada and the United States, and the other G7 partners with your leadership. I'm very much looking forward to the meeting them. Grateful to have you.\n\nDonald Trump (01:17):\n\nWell, thank you very much, Mark. I appreciate it. And we have developed a very good relationship, and we're going to be talking about trade and many other things. And we have a whole group of people, some traders and some other people. I see my top economy people. But we have a very talented group of people, and you do too. And I know they work together very well. I look forward to that. The G7 used to be the G8. Barack Obama and a person named Trudeau didn't want to have Russia in. And I would say that that was a mistake, because I think you wouldn't have a war right now if you had Russia in. And you wouldn't have a war right now if Trump were president four years ago.\n\n(01:56)But it didn't work out that way. But it used to be the G8, and now it's, I guess, what's that, nine years ago, eight years ago, it switched over. They threw Russia out, which I claimed was a very big mistake, even though I wasn't in politics. And I was very loud about it. It was a mistake, in that you spend so much time talking about Russia, and he's no longer at the table. So it makes life more complicated. But you wouldn't have had the war. And other than that, I think we're going to accomplish a lot, and I expect to. And I think our primary focus will be trade and trade with Canada. And I'm sure we can work something out.\n\nMark Carney (02:34):\n\nYes, very good.\n\nDonald Trump (02:36):\n\nThank you very much.\n\nMark Carney (02:37):\n\nYes, so much. Thank you very much. [inaudible 00:02:39].\n\nSpeaker 5 (02:46):\n\nWhat is holding up a deal with Canada, from your perspective?\n\nDonald Trump (02:49):\n\nIt's not so much holding up. I think we have different concepts. I have a tariff concept. Mark has a different concept, which is something that some people like. But we're going to see if we can get to the bottom of it today. I'm a tariff person. I have always been a tariff… It's simple. It's easy. It's precise. And it just goes very quickly. And I think Mark has a more complex idea, but also very good. So we're going to look at both, and we're going to see what… We're going to come out with something hopefully. [inaudible 00:03:23]\n\nSpeaker 6 (03:24):\n\nDo you think a deal is achievable within days, within weeks? Is there that kind of runway?\n\nDonald Trump (03:29):\n\nYeah, it's achievable. Both parties have to agree. Yeah, sure. [inaudible 00:03:34]\n\nSpeaker 7 (03:35):\n\nHave you heard any signals or seen any messages from intermediaries that Iran wishes to de-escalate the conflict?\n\nDonald Trump (03:42):\n\nYeah.\n\nSpeaker 7 (03:44):\n\nWhat have you heard? What have you heard from the Iranians?\n\nDonald Trump (03:46):\n\nThey'd like to talk, but they should have done that before. I had 60 days, and they had 60 days. And on the 61st day, I said, we don't have a deal. They have to make a deal. And it's painful for both parties, but I'd say Iran is not winning this war. And they should talk, and they should talk immediately before it's too late.\n\nSpeaker 7 (04:09):\n\nAnd what would you say, in your opinion, what would it take for the U.S. to get involved in this conflict militarily?\n\nDonald Trump (04:15):\n\nI don't want to talk about that. We'll see.\n\nSpeaker 7 (04:17):\n\nAnd you mentioned Putin. Do you think that he should have a seat at the G7 today, that it should be the G8?\n\nDonald Trump (04:22):\n\nI'm not saying he should at this point, because too much water's gone over the dam maybe. But it was a big mistake. Obama didn't want him. And the head of your country, the proud head of your country, didn't want him. This was a big mistake. You wouldn't have that war. You have your enemy at the table. I don't even consider him… He wasn't really an enemy at that time. There was no concept. If I were president, this war would have never happened. But likewise, if he were a member of what was called the G8 at that time, it was always the G8, you wouldn't have a war right now. [inaudible 00:04:57]\n\nSpeaker 8 (04:57):\n\nWhat material support and what intelligence support are you providing Israel?\n\nDonald Trump (05:03):\n\nWe've always supported Israel. We have, for a long period of time, strongly. And Israel is doing very well right now.\n\nSpeaker 9 (05:10):\n\nWhy not have China as the G8? Why not have China here, the biggest economy in the world after the United States?\n\nDonald Trump (05:16):\n\nWell, it's not a bad idea. I don't mind that. If somebody wants to suggest China coming in, I think we suggest. But you want to have people that you can talk to. They don't talk. Putin speaks to me. He doesn't speak to anybody else. He doesn't want to talk, because he was very insulted when he got thrown out of the G8, as I would be, as you would be, as anybody would be. He was very insulted. And, I mean, he was thrown out by Trudeau, who convinced one or two people, along with Obama. He was thrown out. And he's not a happy person about it. I can tell you that. He didn't [inaudible 00:05:50] He basically doesn't even speak to the people that threw him out. And I agree with him. [inaudible 00:05:56] Go ahead.\n\nSpeaker 10 (06:00):\n\nOn immigration, why are you ordering ICE to target Democratic inner cities? What's behind that?\n\nDonald Trump (06:04):\n\nI don't know what you're saying.\n\nSpeaker 10 (06:05):\n\nYou did a post last night where you said you want ICE to really target Democratic-\n\nDonald Trump (06:09):\n\nYeah, I want them to focus on the cities because the cities are where you really have what's called sanctuary cities. And that's where the people are. I look at New York. I look at Chicago. I mean, you've got a really bad governor in Chicago and a bad mayor. But the governor is probably the worst in the country, Pritzker. But I look at how that city has been overrun by criminals, and New York and L.A. Look at L.A. Those people weren't from L.A. They weren't from California, most of those people, many of those people. And, yeah, that's a focus. Biden allowed 21 million people to come into our country. Of that, vast numbers of those people were murderers, killers, people from gangs, people from jails. They empty their jails out into the U.S. Most of those people are in the cities, all blue cities, all Democrat-run cities. And they think they're going to use them to vote. It's not going to happen. [inaudible 00:07:06].\n\nMark Carney (07:11):\n\nIf you don't mind, just I'm going to exercise my role, if you will, as G7 chair, since we have a few more minutes with the president and his team. And then we actually have to start the meeting to address some of these big issues. [inaudible 00:07:25].",

    "transcript": "Speaker 1 (00:10):\n\nLadies and gentlemen, the President of the United States.\n\nDonald Trump (00:44):\n\nWell, thank you very much. I just said to Mike, \"This is fantastic.\" I didn't think we were going to see this coming for a while. Congratulations. This is a very, very important thing. Thank you very much, everybody. This is a very important thing we're going to be discussing. Please sit down. Thank you very much. This is good news, indeed. People said it couldn't be done. You got it done. I just have to sign, right? That's very good. This is really something. And it has to do with the California Auto Regulation, CRA. It's been a disaster for this country. And I want to thank everybody for being here. We officially rescue the US auto industry from destruction by terminating California electric vehicle mandate once and for all. [inaudible 00:01:38].\n\n(01:37)So good. They said it couldn't be done, but boy, it's had us tied up in knots for years. And they'd pass these crazy rules in California, and would be 17 states would go by them. The automakers didn't know what to do because they're really building cars for two countries. When you have 17 states, you're building cars for two countries. And I want to congratulate you all, the Senate, the House, the whole thing. It's incredible. I was going to sign a executive order and give it a shot. But the one good thing with this, number one, it holds up forever. And number two, unless somebody votes it out, they'll never do that. And it's just so much better, huh? It's so much better. That's so great. Very proud of you. We're joined today by the great speaker of the House. I think he's going to go down as a great speaker of the House too.\n\n(02:56)I may be wrong. I may be wrong. Who knows? Who the hell knows? I think he is. And he's doing something. The only thing I would say is more important than this one, and I'll tell you what, it's almost close. That's how big this is today. But the great, big, beautiful … I added the word great. I used the word. The great, big, beautiful bill. It's going to be one of the … I said it this morning to a group. Think it's the most important, one of the most important pieces of legislation ever signed, ever approved. So it's going to be something very special. Thank you very much. Speaker of the House, Mike Johnson, thank you. Secretary Sean Duffy. And they had a problem in India today [inaudible 00:03:44]. Sean's doing a tremendous job. Secretary Chris Wright, everybody said you'd never be able to get him. He's the most talented man, they say, in the oil and gas industry. I'll let you know in about two years if that's true. Well, Doug Burgum. I wanted Doug Burgum to head up energy because he was so successful in North Dakota, it's governor. And he said, \"Sir, there's one person who's much better than me.\" I said, \"Who?\" They said Chris Wright. I said, \"Who the hell is Chris Wright?\" I had no idea. Now everyone knows Chris Wright. He's going to be more famous than me. But he said, \"There's a guy named Chris Wright. And if we could get him, he'd be better than I am, sir.\" And if you know Doug … Doug's not here, is he? If you knew Doug, he's always working someplace. But if you knew Doug, you'd know that he doesn't say that often. And he did. And Chris, you're doing great. But I don't like the oil prices have gone up just a little bit over the last few days. I was going to call and just really start screaming at you.\n\n(04:52)Are we okay? Nothing wrong, right? It's going to keep going down a little bit, right? Because we have inflation under control perfectly. You probably saw the records. Everyone's on television saying, \"What's going on here? Trump has proven to be right.\" All of these things. We've taken it 88 billion in tariffs in two months. 88 billion with no inflation. And if we're smart, there won't be. Now, would like to get this guy to lower interest rates because if he doesn't, we have to pay. We have a lot of short-term debt. Obama gave it to us originally, and Biden carried it on. They like short term. I like long-term cheap debt. But a lot of the debt comes through because Biden, that's what … Well, he didn't do it. I'm sure he didn't know anything about it, but somebody approved short-term debt. It's all over the place. And it comes due starting very soon.\n\n(05:49)And if we would lower the interest rates by one point, we'd pay about one point less. That's $300 billion a year. Can you believe? At one point. If he'd lower it by two points, we'd pay $600 billion a year less. That's for years, 10 years, 12 years, whatever we make it. But we can't get this guy to do it. And the fake news is saying, \"Oh, if you fired him, it would be so bad. It would be so bad.\" I don't know why it would be so bad, but I'm not going to fire him. I just want him to … We call him Too Late, right? Too Late is his nick … Like Too Tall Jones, he was too tall, T-O-O. And I just say this because we want to get rid of inflation, and we have, but we're going to be paying more for debt. And all he has to do is lower it.\n\n(06:42)Europe's done 10 lowerings. We've done none. And nobody understands it. Actually, today, when the numbers came out, they were so good. You saw yesterday's numbers. Incredible. No inflation. Today's numbers … Today just came out. Same thing. No inflation. They're all shocked. All these guys are watching from business, CNBC, and all of these different networks. Maria Bartiromo actually got it right. She's been getting it right for a long time, that one. I hope she's appreciated. And Joe Kernen's been very good at CNBC, I must tell you. But other people aren't so good. But I will say that they can't believe what's happening. But if I could, because we can discuss … Oh, we got a lot of press. We got a lot of cameras rolling right now. Not that I like doing it because I don't.\n\n(07:39)But if we cut our interest by one point, for years, we save 300 billion. If we cut it by two points, we save because it's pretty equivalent. We're going to save. We're going to spend 600 billion a year. 600 billion because of one numbskull that sits here. \"I don't see enough reason to cut the rates now.\" And the problem he's got is that … And I explained to him, \"Look, if inflation went up, cut your rates now.\" There's no inflation. We got it down, we got prices down, we got gasoline down. And you'll keep it going down.\n\n(08:24)But gasoline's down. It's drill, baby, drill. That's why it's going down. But where all that … But think of it. I said to him … He was in my office a couple of days ago. I said, \"If you think there's inflation, let's find out because I think we're going to keep it down. I think gasoline's going to be so far down. Oil, energy is so much. We have so much energy, we don't know what to do with it. But let's say there was inflation in a year from now. Raise your rates. I don't mind. Raise your rates. I'm all for it. I'll be the one to … I'll be calling you.\" He'll be too late for that too. But raise your rates. You don't have to keep them up here. If it's going to go up, I'm okay with you raising, but it's down and we're going out to financing and I may have to force something.\n\n(09:16)Somebody said, \"Who's the genius that thought of that?\" I said, \"It's me.\" Unlike Biden, I stay awake at night thinking about how to save our country. He was much better at sleeping than me. Could sleep on a beach. He could sleep on a beach with cameras rolling. I can't do that. But I had an idea. I gave it. They said, \"This is really … We'll go short term for a year. Let this guy get out of office. Some guy will come and cut it a couple of points and we'll save ourself seven, eight, maybe even $900 billion a year. What is he doing? Why doesn't he lower these rates?\" And with that, we'll get onto the California standard, which is a disaster. Okay? So Chris Wright, you're going to get the numbers down. Thank you very much. Lee Zeldin, one of the most important men in this room.\n\n(10:07)He's the man. I get nervous when I talk to him. You're doing a great job. Nuclear, I say, \"Okay. You can take two weeks for that approval.\" It used to take 20 years. Then they wouldn't approve it. Now I say, \"Lee, Nuclear, I'll give you two weeks for an approval. A coal-fired plant, you only get a couple of days. And oil and gas, we'll give you a week. Okay?\" Something like that. But he's doing it so fast. And we have so many plants being built right now. It's so beautiful to see. And one of the reasons they're coming here is because they have to produce tremendous … Especially the AI. They have to produce beyond believable amounts of electricity. And they're doing … I said to them, \"I think this was more or less my idea.\" They didn't have the idea only because they didn't think a thing like this was possible.\n\n(11:02)I said, \"As you build your plant, you're going to become a utility and you're going to build a separate plant right alongside of it. You're going to build it. You're going to build a plant that produces electricity. And you'll produce it through natural gas, coal, nuclear.\" We don't want to produce it through wind because we don't feel like ruining 50 miles of beautiful plains and beautiful vistas, but we want to produce. Interestingly, China's opening up a coal plant every single week, but now I'm finding out it might be two plants every single week. And usually, that's a good gauge. If they're using coal, I guess we're supposed to use coal. And we went to a coal standard. And not that you have to use coal. You're going to use whatever's best.\n\n(11:46)I want to introduce also Senate Majority Whip, John Barrasso, who's a tremendous guy, doctor. [inaudible 00:11:52]. And he is a tremendous guy. Tremendously talented doctor. When I have a medical situation for the country, for myself, I haven't used him, but I might have to. Maybe I'll do that. It's serious enough, I think I'd probably do that. But he's a tremendously talented gentleman who happens to be a Senator, and one that's very respected. Chairwoman Shelley Moore Capito. And congratulations. I just endorsed your son. Did you know that? I endorsed your son. I endorsed your son who's running in West Virginia. And he's great. In fact, he's all Trump all the time. I think much more so than you, actually [inaudible 00:12:41]. You were his largest impediment. No, I'm only kidding. He's all Trump all the time. And he's going to win big. And so congratulate him. Okay? He's really been fantastic. So many people have told me. Thank you. And House Majority Leader, Steve Scalise, who's a brave man. He went through hell. Steve went through hell. And we have a lot of other people here that I won't be able to because I don't have your name down. And I'm looking and I see people's names. I'll do a couple of you, but thanks as well to Markwayne Mullin. Senator Markwayne, thank you. Stand up, Markwayne. Don't fight him.\n\n(13:24)He's a serious fighter in a lot of ways. And he's a great guy too. Thank you, Markwayne. Deb Fischer. Deb. Thank you, Deb. Hey. Pete Ricketts, who's going to do very well in the upcoming election. Thank you. Thank you, Pete. Jon Husted, who's really moving along in Ohio. Jon, good luck. You're going to do well. All endorsed people. John Curtis, who's doing terrifically. John, thank you. Good job. They all say excellent. What can I tell you? Good job. And Bernie Moreno, who won a race that was not winnable. They all said, \"It's not winnable.\" He won in Ohio. They said, \"You can't win that race. It's a waste of time.\" You're just wasting your time, right, Bernie? Wasn't a waste of time, was it, huh? And he won by like five points too. Won by a lot. Along with representatives Kevin Kiley, Vince Fong, Jay Obernolte, Doug LaMalfa, Darrell Issa. Where's Darrell? I haven't seen you in such a long time. Look at you. How good you look, huh? It's good when you have those big margins. It's easier.\n\n(14:42)John Joyce, great guy. John, thank you. Thank you, John. Dusty Johnson, Morgan Griffith, Troy Balderson. Troy from a place called Ohio. And he played very cute at one time, but then he got … Boy, I tell you, he's become a good politician. Where is Troy now? Where? I haven't seen him used for years. I endorsed you early when he was early and younger, but you still look young. And you've done fantastically good. Good work. Really good work. Claudia Tenney, New York. Claudia. Thank you, Claudia. John James. John James. I don't know. You know he's running for governor, but I'm not sure I'm happy about that, John. Do we have somebody good to take your seat?\n\nJohn James (15:34):\n\n[inaudible 00:15:36].\n\nDonald Trump (15:35):\n\nBecause otherwise, we're not letting him run for governor. We can't. You have somebody good, right?\n\nJohn James (15:41):\n\nYes.\n\nDonald Trump (15:41):\n\nOkay. As long as you like him, they'll win. Tracey Mann. Tracey, thank you very much. Thank you very much. Appreciate it. Michael Baumgartner. Michael. Thank you, Michael. Good. Good job. David Rouzer. Rouzer. Thank you. Glenn Grothman. Hi, Glenn. Thank you very much, Glenn. Brett Guthrie. Brett. Thank you, Brett. Rudy Yakym. Thank you. Thank you, Rudy. And I want to thank you all. There's some additional people in the room, but we have to get back to … This is like so big. This is a big one. Under the previous administration … The previous administration. I could go point after point, everything they did. Open borders, men playing in women's sports, transgender for everybody. Everybody, let's go transgender. What a group of people you had over there. They must have hated our country. Under the previous administration, the federal government gave left-wing radicals in California dictatorial powers to control the future of the entire car industry all over the country. All over the world, actually. Because they have to build a car. They can't build 19 different cars called the same thing. And really, it was all over the world, what was happening. They approved Governor Gavin Newsom's ridiculous plan to impose a 100% ban on all new gas-powered cars within a very short period of time. Think of this. You couldn't buy any other car, except an electric-powered car. And in California, they have blackouts and brownouts. They don't have enough electricity right now to do the job. And country-wide, you'd have to spend $4 trillion to build the firing plans to be able to … they call it a firing … They call them a lot of things. Charging plants. Firing plants. $4 trillion you'd have to spend. In the Midwest, they built nine of them. Nine individual. It's like a pump. Just like a pump, except instead of gas, electricity comes out. Actually, they built eight of them. $9 billion they spent for eight.\n\n(18:10)Eight little hoses, $9 billion. Now, I'm sure they could have done it for about one 1,000th of that, but even if they did, it's unaffordable. They approved Governor Gavin's ridiculous … It's so ridiculous. By the way, if I didn't bring the military in, Los Angeles would be burning down right now. It'd be burning just like his damn houses burned down because he didn't have the water that he should have had. He had so much water. They have so much water. We had to send in the military to free up the water. And we did that right after the fires. We told them to do it in the first term. But just like that ridiculous plan, this is a plan to ban. Think of it. A plan to ban 100 … And they call it the 100% ban on all new gas-powered cars and abolish 75% of the gas-powered trucks. 75%. The trucking industry saw me.\n\n(19:08)They said, \"Sir, it doesn't work.\" Number one, the trucks are so heavy. They're two and a half times heavier than a diesel-powered truck. So one of the big truckers owns 28,000 trucks. Big company. Tremendous company. He said, \"I go out of business immediately. I'm not going to play games.\" Said, \"Did you explain these things to the government officials? Like the truck weighs two and a half times more, two and a half times more than a regular truck, a gasoline-powered diesel.\" And he said, \"Based on that, we have to rebuild every bridge in the United States of America because it wasn't designed to hold cars and trucks that heavy,\" because the batteries are very heavy, probably lead. They have a lot of things in those batteries that weigh a lot. But it's two and a half times. It's a simple number. Two and a half times.\n\n(20:01)And if you want to do this, you have to spend trillions and trillions of dollars on rebuilding every bridge in the United States, and I guess throughout the world because they do follow us. And the big rig buses and even cement trucks, they want to abolish certain categories of truck, but they want to go … 75% of all of these trucks have to be abolished almost immediately. The time is just crazy. And they don't go far. Another little problem. With a tank of diesel, you can go from New York to Los Angeles, if you want to go to Los Angeles right now, but New York to Los Angeles, and you can go back a little bit. With the electric truck, you'll stop approximately six times.\n\nDonald Trump (21:00):\n\nEnjoy your stop. And the trucker saw me and I said, \"Did you just explain this?\" Because this is like if you explained it, if a person's reasonable for that, they said, \"We explained it, they didn't care.\" They said, \"We're going all electric.\" They're, they can't be stupid because anybody that can cheat on elections like them is not a stupid person, but they must hate our country. But I said to this big trucker, he said, \"Sir, I've been buying trucks my whole damn life.\" He's a rough guy, smart guy. He said, I got thousands of them. I've been buying them for 50 years, and every single year they got better. They got more efficient, they got bigger, they got stronger. I build apartments in my trucks now for the drivers. So what's an apartment? That's on the cab. They put this thing, and so I know you like luxury, but you wouldn't mind living in one of these.\n\n(21:58)I said, \"Maybe I would. Maybe I wouldn't.\" I mean, it doesn't sound too appealing, but I said, \"So what's the problem?\" He said, \"So I noticed one thing. For 50 years, every single year, one thing happened. They got better. They got stronger, they got more efficient, they got faster. They could carry any load. If we went to this standard, we'd go back beyond 50 years, they wouldn't go as far as a truck from 50 years ago. It would be too heavy and have all the other problems.\" He said, \"We'd be going backwards. We'd be taking a truck and initially we'd be starting all over, but actually it would be worse because it was better 50 years ago than…\" So I said, \"What are you going to do if I don't win this election?\" This was before the election.\n\n(22:51)He said, \"You don't win the election, I'm going to close up my business because I'm not going to lose my,\" he said, \"I'm not going to lose my ass. I know exactly what's going to happen. It's going to be a catastrophe. It's the craziest thing I've ever heard.\" They're making you buy stuff that doesn't work. It's no good. It doesn't work, and I'm all for electric. If you want to buy electric, you can buy. Electric cars are great if you buy the right ones. Cars are great, and you should be given the option, buy the electric car, buy a gasoline-powered car, buy a hybrid. Probably not hydrogen, because hydrogen has a tendency that when it blows up, you're done-so. It's over. They find you 75 yards down the road. Where is he? Well, I think that's him, but I'm not sure. So they said, \"We think we can solve the problem.\"\n\n(23:45)I said, \"That's not good enough when they think.\" No, it's sounds like it's quite severe. If it doesn't work, Steve, it'll work most of the time, but if it doesn't, it's over. It'll make your accident look like peanuts compared. You wouldn't be around, I'll tell you, because it's pretty, but some people like it. I don't know. Let's see what happens, but I would say it's off to a bad start. But because of the size of California's population and the fact that 17 other states follow California, that's the problem. 17 other states follow California. They have the most ridiculous laws I've ever seen for a lot of things. This is just cars and trucks and all. They have a lot of them for other things, but we have, it's called the California Car Standards, and this horrible scheme would effectively abolish the internal combustion engine, which most people prefer.\n\n(24:42)Like so far, I'd say about 90%. In fact, General Motors announced yesterday they're going to spend about $6 billion because of tariffs and maybe because of my election on November 5th. But because of tariffs, I think more than anything they're all coming back. They're coming back from other countries that took them 25, 30 years ago. They're all coming back. We have now almost $15 trillion. They had almost nothing last year and year before. Very little, nobody wanted to be back here. Nobody wanted to come to our country anymore because we were like stupid people. We looked like stupid people. We were laughed at all over the world. Now we're not laughed at anymore. I can tell you that, but they wanted to shatter our domestic supply chains and literally grind civilization to a halt. We would've gone so far back. It's hard to believe, actually. Hard to believe when you don't have enough electricity to give a person a little air conditioning in the summer and now they want you to take electricity and fire up all these cars, but we're not going to let that happen.\n\n(25:48)Meanwhile, all of the auto jobs would be shipped to China because they're very strong on electric and it lives off an estimated 200,000 American auto workers would be destroyed. It's one of the reasons I did so well with the United Auto Workers and now I'm really doing well with them. I did phenomenally with them. No Republican ever got any numbers like I got, and the Teamsters too. Sean O'Brien, the head of the Teamsters, these guys, they like Trump because I produce jobs. They know that. Everybody knew that. The auto workers knew better than anybody how good the tariffs were, and the head of the auto workers, I don't know him at all, but he didn't like me at all. Now he's going around saying, \"This guy's unbelievable.\" He was very nice to me the last few months during the campaign. No, but I've proven, I've proven it.\n\n(26:41)I've done what I said I was going to do and we've brought back tremendous numbers of jobs, and you're having auto plants built all over the country. All over. They've never seen anything like that. They're leaving from Mexico, they're leaving from Canada. They're leaving from other parts of the world. If they want a Mercedes- Benz, you're going to have it made here. It's okay to have a Mercedes, but they're going to make it here. Otherwise, they're going to pay a very big tariff. They already are. That's one of the reasons we have $88 billion. It's a lot of money, but that's peanuts compared to what we're going to be making in another few months. They haven't even kicked in yet, but we're not going to let any of these bad things happen, these stupid projections that I've been reading about for the last six months.\n\n(27:25)I think these people are either corrupt or really dumb, and they're supposed to be economists. And the campaign I promised to end this disaster, and today our Republican majorities in Congress have delivered. And I don't know, I can't imagine. It's so obvious. It's so good. Did we get any Democrat votes? Did we get one, two?\n\nSpeaker 2 (27:48):\n\n35.\n\nDonald Trump (27:48):\n\nWho?\n\nSpeaker 2 (27:48):\n\n35 Democrats.\n\nDonald Trump (27:51):\n\n35?\n\nSpeaker 2 (27:51):\n\nYes, sir.\n\nDonald Trump (27:52):\n\nI think that's great. I think that's great. You got 35 Democrats.\n\nSpeaker 2 (27:56):\n\n35. Yes, sir.\n\nDonald Trump (27:57):\n\nI think that's great. That, as far as I'm concerned-\n\nSpeaker 3 (28:02):\n\nOne in the Senate.\n\nSpeaker 2 (28:03):\n\nOne Senate.\n\nDonald Trump (28:04):\n\nOne in the Senate on something that's so good, but who was the one?\n\nSpeaker 3 (28:08):\n\nSlotkin.\n\nSpeaker 2 (28:08):\n\nSlotkin, Michigan.\n\nDonald Trump (28:16):\n\nWell, I shouldn't have asked. I congratulate her. I don't care. I think it's great. It's very interesting. Why did I ask that question, Mister? But in a few moments, I'll sign three pieces of legislation that will kill, totally killed, you can't do anything about it. They can't take us to court. They can't do any of the things they can do with the executive orders, and it's permanent. I'll sign three pieces of legislation that will kill the California mandates forever, and they're never coming back. Now, the auto companies are the most happy because now they're going to be designing and building one auto. It will be much cheaper. It's a much less expensive. They were showing me, one of the most respected people were showing me that to save a little, like a half a glass of fuel, cost them thousands of dollars with new computers and stop it, the engine has to stop and then turn on and blah, blah, blah.\n\n(29:19)And I said, \"Does it work as well?\" No, it's terrible. It's terrible. And that's to save a little bit of fuel, this much fuel that Chris Wright can produce with one extra little oil well someplace, right? One little small one, a very small one. But think of it, your cars are going to cost you 3,000, $4,000 less and you're going to have what you want. And again, you can get any car you want. You can get electric. A lot of people love the electric. They like Tesla. So do I, in all fairness. I like Tesla and I like others too, but I also like combustion and there are reasons for a lot of things. When I was in Iowa, we had an unbelievable victory, if you remember. Remember? That was nice. You won by so much.\n\n(30:07)Nobody even talked about anything else, but that was a great victory, but it was unbelievably cold that night and I was going to watch my victory in the area where I was going to make a speech and the whole place was littered with cars. I said, \"What happened?\" They were electric cars and they don't work in cold. I said, \"I didn't know that.\" And they don't work in extreme heat either. Other than that, they're wonderful. But no, but if you're in a cold climate, how do you do that? But there are electric cars, and I noticed that and then I didn't pay much attention because we won by about 65 points, so I was more interested in that. But I do remember that scene. I said, \"What the hell is going on over here?\" This historic action will also help us reduce inflation and bring down the price of automobiles and electricity very, very substantially. We're building massive electricity right now. It's already started because of that guy right there. Lee Zeldin, by far the most important man in the room, Mr. Speaker. Stand up, Lee.\n\n(31:15)He blows you guys away, John. He blows the politicians away. I'm sorry right now. He actually, he's a great politician though. He almost won for governor in New York, which is just missed by a few points. And that was another race that was not winnable, but you almost got it. But I think what you're doing now is even bigger if you want to know the truth. I think it's actually more important if you can believe that. Under the previous regime, car prices skyrocketed as a direct result of the mandates. These mandates, this nonsense that you had to do, and they have so many other rules and regulations that the car companies who are here today appreciate that. And Susie Wiles is here today. Stand up, Susie. The most incredible woman, most powerful woman in the world they say. She's the most powerful, she was rated the most powerful woman in the world, Susie Wiles, one phone call and a nation is destroyed.\n\n(32:13)She could destroy five nations with five calls and she's doing a great job more importantly, right? Doing a great job. There's nobody like her. Energy prices with likewise soar as a radical left force more electric vehicles onto the grid while blocking approvals for new power plants. They want to block the approvals. They want you to have a car with electric, but they block the production of the juice that runs the cars, and all of them, all forms of cars. It's just the craziest thing. We're in a different sphere now. We're in a whole different planet right now. The result would be rolling blackouts in a collapse of our power systems. We'd have a total collapse. You couldn't do it. You couldn't even do it. Think of it. They're forcing you to do something, and they want you to do, boats also, I assume boats are being covered by this and boats, they want you to go all electric and the batteries are so heavy, the damn boat practically doesn't float.\n\n(33:15)I used to have a lot of fun talking about that one on the tours. We'd talk about it and I said, \"What would happen if the boat sank?\" Because we went to North Carolina, South Carolina, we visited boat factories, unbelievable guys. And they said, \"Sir, we have one problem. They're forcing us to go electric for the boat.\" I said, \"How's it going to work?\" \"The boat will not float, sir. It's so heavy and it won't go fast.\" And lots of other, and I did ask him a question because I have a lot of background. My uncle was a big shot at MIT, the smartest guy. He never had a smarter guy, and I guess I have a little of that. My first question was, \"What would happen if the boat sank? Do you get electrocuted?\" Remember I said that? And I used to be decimated by these people back here, right?\n\n(34:04)I used to be decimated. They'd say, \"What kind of a crazy question is that?\" I'm actually serious. What happens if you're an electric boat and the boat is going down? You're in trouble, Susie. And I used to say, I remember, oh, I'd get decimated. The audience loved it, but the press would laugh at it. I said, \"So if I have my choice of going down or jumping five or six yards away from the boat, but there's a shark there, what do I do?\" You know what I said? \"I'd rather be electrocuted.\" I said, \"I'll take electrocution every single day.\" But actually he said, \"Nobody's ever asked me that question, sir.\" He makes boats. \"Nobody ever asked me that question. This is really an unusual question.\" He said, \"And honestly, I don't have the answer.\" He wasn't able to… I said, \"Don't worry about it. If I win, you won't have to worry about it.\"\n\n(34:54)But today we're saving California and we're saving our entire country from a disaster. Your cars are going to be thousands of dollars less money. And even the ones that if you buy electric, we're not going to make you do certain things that are just a waste of money and just time-consuming waste of money. They make you do things that are no good for anybody, make the car worse and make it much more expensive. Over the past five months, our administration and Republicans in Congress have fought for the American auto worker and for Teamsters and for by the way, right to work. We have them all. We just call them just workers. We fought for workers like no one has ever fought before. I understand that. It's why we won. We won with workers. We won with young people. I just saw with TikTok, I was number one on TikTok and it's history.\n\n(35:48)Can you believe that? So I guess I like TikTok. That's why they're saying, \"Are you saving it?\" We probably will save TikTok actually. But on my first day in office, I ended the Green New Scam and abolished the EV mandate at the federal level. We abolished it, which is basically that everybody would be driving an electric car within a very short period of time. Now I know why Elon doesn't like me so much, which he does, actually. He does, and he never had a problem. It's very interesting. This is not something new. This has been there from day one, Speaker, right? We're going to abolish the EV mandate. And Elon still endorsed me, because honestly, he never ever spoke to me about that. And I used to say, \"I'm amazed that he's endorsing me because that can't be good for him. I'm abolishing the EV mandate.\" And I once asked him about it, you never talked to me about that.\n\n(36:42)He said, \"Well, as long as it's happening to everybody, I'll be able to compete.\" It was a very interesting answer. I thought it was a very honest answer to be honest with you. And I talked about it that, incredible. You would've thought he would've been, from day one, \"You got to make sure you don't do the EV mandate, the abolishing,\" and never did. Very honest in that sense. And he did say to me, I actually asked him because it was really strange how I'm with him. He's a friend of mine and he makes electric cars and we're saying, \"You're not going to be able to make electric cars or you're not going to be forced to make all of those cars. You can make them, but it'll be by the market, judged by the market.\" And that's what he said. He said, \"As long as I'm on the same plane as everybody else, we're going to do good. We make a better product.\"\n\n(37:29)I said, \"That's very cool. That's very cool.\" That was my answer. After that, he got a little bit strange, but I don't know why, over much smaller things than that. As part of the one Big Beautiful Bill, we'll also further slash the funding for the Green New Scam. As you know, it's the greatest scam in history, saving American taxpayers hundreds of billions of dollars. The windmills are killing our country by the way. The fields are littered with them, junk. They're littered with them, and they get older and they get rusty and they get bad and they get, this is other countries also. It's the greatest scam in history. It's the most expensive energy you can buy. They're ugly. A friend of mine comes from Minnesota. He's been in New York. He hit it big. He's a very successful guy actually. And he wanted to go back, see his mother who's not well.\n\n(38:23)And he went back to Minnesota, hasn't been back there in 20 years, and he said, \"It's unbelievable what happened.\" He said, \"I'm driving down a highway and up a certain road and the most beautiful fields. I remember them so well, and I was so looking forward to seeing them again. And I looked at him and they had windmills all over them, these horrible, horrible structures.\" Very smart guy, this guy. And he said, \"These ugly, horrible things.\" And he said, \"It was so bad I actually drove back to see it because I couldn't believe it. Before I even got to my mother, I drove back.\" I said, \"How much do you like your mother?\" But no, it hurt him to see it. He said, \"I looked at this field that was one of the most beautiful places in my own mind and imagination that I've ever seen.\" And I said, \"It's littered with this garbage.\"\n\n(39:16)\"It looked like a junkyard,\" he said, and then you get different manufacturers and they don't look alike and they're not painted alike, different colors. Even if they're white, one's a beige-y white, one's a darker white, one's a lighter white, and then they start to rust after four or five years and then they start to wear out and nobody takes them because you're not allowed to bury the propellers, the props, right? You can't bury the props for some reason. I don't know why, but they say that you can't bury it. It's a certain type of fiber and if it goes in the ground, we're all going to die. It's what bullshit this is. Okay, they can't bury it, so what they do is they leave them up. If you go to Palm Springs, California, take a look, you go into this beautiful community, before you go, it's like you're riding through a junkyard. Windmills all over the place.\n\n(40:10)Tall ones, short ones, dead ones, they're all dead. Some are hanging over by a thread. They never take them down. They just leave them there and they start to rust. It's one of the greatest scams and it's also the most expensive energy. And the environmentalists say, \"Oh, we love wind. It sounds so good,\" but it's a horrible thing. Environmentally, it's a horrible thing. I say that to you. It's wind, and we are going to have virtually no, one mandate we have, we're going to natural gas, nuclear. We just had a big signing with nuclear, making it easier, safer and better. It's really, I would say probably more than any other form of energy that's come about, it's been amazing what's been done. It's very safe, very good and very inexpensive, but we're not going to let windmills get built because we're not going to destroy our country any further than it's already been destroyed.\n\n(41:08)You go and look at these beautiful plains and valleys and they're loaded up with this garbage that gets worse and worse looking with time starts when the rust comes, 4.5 years, it starts to rust, and it's very expensive to paint them, so they don't paint them and they're horrible. What's happened is horrible. So we're not going to approve windmills unless something happens that's an emergency. I guess it could happen, but we're not doing any of them. I hope the Senate will soon pass a bill. The house can quickly approve and get to my desk by the 4th of July. We'll have this done. And to further defend our auto workers, I imposed a 25% tariff on all foreign automobiles. Investment in American auto manufacturing is surging because of it. They have Mercedes all over. They pay\n\nDonald Trump (42:00):\n\n… 25% if they don't make the car in the United States, and because of that… And this could have been done long before Trump, this could have been done by any one of the presidents. I did it with China. The reason you don't have Chinese cars here is because I imposed it in my last term. I actually asked that question, I said, \"Do we have any Chinese cars here?\"\n\n(42:20)\"No.\"\n\n(42:20)\"Why?\"\n\n(42:20)\"Because you imposed a 25% or 27.5% tariff on Chinese cars, so they're not coming here, but they are going to Europe all over the place.\"\n\n(42:33)But I love China. We just made a deal and I respect President Xi a lot, and we made a deal that's good for both countries. The deal we made with China is good for both countries. There's going to be a lot of money made and it's going to ultimately open up China, which is the ultimate thing, and I'm going to be working with President Xi. We had a long talk about it, and that's going to be good for China, it's going to be good for us. But we're going to be opening up China, that's bigger than what we signed, and I think had we not signed it, that wouldn't be happening. It's going to happen, it's going to happen fairly soon.\n\n(43:06)But to further defend our autoworkers, I imposed this 25% tariff on all foreign automobiles and investment in American manufacturing and auto manufacturing, all manufacturing is surging, and I might go up with that tariff in the not-too-distant future. The higher you go, the more likely it is they build a plant here. Ford has just announced that it's going to invest $500 million in some of the things involved in what we just did. General Motors is going to spend $4 billion, they just announced that yesterday. Stellantis announced that it's going to reopen its Belvedere assembly plant, that's good. I know the plant very well, had a lot of problems, they're going to spend $5 billion.\n\n(43:52)And Hyundai announced that it will invest $21 billion in America. They wouldn't have invested 10 cents if we didn't have tariffs. Including for manufacturing, American Steel, which is doing great. American Steel is doing great now because of what we did. If I didn't put tariffs on steel, China and a lot of other countries were dumping steel in our country, garbage steel, dirty steel, bad steel, not structurally sound steel, real garbage, but it was still there, lots of it. And if I didn't put tariffs, I put 25% and 50% tariffs on steel, John James would put tariffs in steel and we were doing great with steel. Now, we're really doing great.\n\n(44:37)Big investments being made in Pennsylvania, you've been reading about it. They're going to spend $17 billion on US Steel and all the steel workers wanted it. And we have a golden stock, we have a golden share, which I control, or the president controls. Now, I'm a little concerned whoever the president might be, but that gives you total control, it's 51% ownership by Americans. And we have a great company, Nippon, they're coming in from Japan, they're going to spend $17 billion. And somebody says, \"Well, what happens if it doesn't work out?\" I said, \"They spent $17 billion.\" We can't put it on a trailer and drive it to Japan, this is steel. Some businesses you can move, you move your office and that's where the business is. With this business, they're spending 17, think of that, $17 billion, they're going to have them all over the country.\n\n(45:34)I want to introduce several of the great Americans representing the millions of people whose livelihoods we're saving with today's action. I just can't tell you how incredible this action is, because nobody thought… This was one that I wasn't… I would've rather had it than almost anything. But I was told by everybody, except that guy right there, that you couldn't get it. Bill Kent runs a chain of family- owned convenience stores that opened in West Texas in 1957, known as Kent Quick. And Bill, if you could come up and say a few words about what the signing means to you, please.\n\nBill Kent (46:21):\n\nWow. You're probably wondering why I've called you all here today, right? What a great day. From my perspective, I'm in the convenience store and petroleum marketing business, and what this does is it gives us freedom. It gives the consumers freedom to pick what kind of car they want, but more importantly for us, it gives us the ability to plan going forward. Because with mandates, we were forced to have to look at putting in infrastructure that frankly is extremely expensive and doesn't give you any return, so this allows us, it's going to free me up and our companies up to invest in what people want, in the cars they want, and it's a great day. So Mr. President, Congress, thank you, Steve, everybody, thank you so much. Thank you.\n\nDonald Trump (47:16):\n\nAnd a friend of mine for a long time is John Hess. He's one of the top CEOs in the country, and he's now the CEO of Hess Corporation, one of the biggest oil producers, and he's a fantastic person with great knowledge of the subject matter. Can you say a few words, John? I see you in the audience. Come on. Thanks.\n\nJohn Hess (47:46):\n\nHi, I'm John Hess and CEO of Hess Corporation, a proud producer of oil and gas in North Dakota and the Gulf of America, so you all know. I was born in New Jersey, grew up in New York, and my father started our company by driving a secondhand oil truck. So Mr. President, it's an honor to be before you today, and thank you for that.\n\n(48:23)Mr. President, during your campaign, you made a commitment to the American people to repeal unworkable and costly mandates for cars and trucks, and let the consumer choose what type of vehicle they drive. Today, with the bipartisan support of Congress, you're making good on that promise. I'd like to recognize Speaker Johnson, Leader Thune, other members of Congress, whose tireless efforts were critical to the outcome we're celebrating today. And a special thank you to Senator Capito for her leadership. This announcement today is about consumer choice and affordability for American families. It's also about making our country auto industry more competitive, Mr. President, and you said that very eloquently. As you know, Mr. President, one-size-fits-all policies, like those adopted in California, do not work. America, in every state, every American should be able to choose what they want to drive, not the government. We as a country would be basically leaning into our competitive advantage with this repeal on oil and gas. Oil and gas are a strategic industry for our country, underpinning energy dominance, economic prosperity and national security. We are truly energy-independent. So Mr. President on behalf of Hess Corporation, on behalf of the oil and gas industry and every family across our country, thank you for your courageous leadership and your commitment to consumer choice and energy affordability. Thank you very much.\n\nDonald Trump (50:20):\n\nVery respected guy. The California EV mandates would also have devastated our nation's incredible truck drivers and the trucking industry, and I gave you a little bit of a rundown on that. But a diesel-powered semi-truck can drive from Reno, Nevada, I'll give you some other locations, Nevada to Los Angeles, California and back, on a single tank of diesel oil, diesel fuel. But the same exact journey would require an electric truck driver to stop also six times at recharging stations, adding an estimated nine hours to the trip. I don't know too much about the trucking industry, but this is not sounding good. Here to discuss a little bit about the trucking industry, Gina Jones, and Gina, a real expert on trucks, I can tell you that, she's going to come up and tell us about trucks. Thank you, Gina.\n\nGina Jones (51:29):\n\nThank you, Mr. President.\n\nDonald Trump (51:29):\n\nThank you very much.\n\nGina Jones (51:30):\n\nAnd thank you, members and Congress. The trucking industry has America's back, and we are grateful that a president and the administration that have our back too. Today, trucks are 99% cleaner than a generation ago. We need great partners in government to continue that process. We cannot allow one state's regulations to disrupt our entire nation's supply chain. Allowing California to do so would have negativity impacted the hundreds and thousands of truck drivers who deliver critical goods across the country each and every day. In order to deliver for American families and businesses, we need realistic national standards. With the signing of this resolution, Mr. President, you have delivered the leadership that trucking industries need, promises made, promises kept. On behalf of the eight and a half million Americans who work throughout the trucking industry, I thank you.\n\nDonald Trump (53:13):\n\nThank you very much. Great job.\n\n(53:20)So just to wrap it up, like I say, under the Trump administration, we will restore the full strength, might and glory of the American auto and trucking industry. We'll protect our truck drivers, auto workers, small business people and manufacturers all over our country, and actually all over the world, and that's okay too. They'll be doing a product that works, a product that's much more efficient, that's better, much better, less expensive, and we'll put affordable energy and affordable car ownership back on the center of the American dream as we make America great again. And that's what's happening, we're making America great.\n\n(54:03)When I went over to Saudi Arabia, Qatar, UAE, just a couple of weeks ago, the leaders of those countries, and they're very smart people, they said, \"You've made in a short period of time America the hottest nation in the world. You're the only one we talk about now. And six months ago, it was a laughingstock.\" They said that to me, those words, \"It was a laughingstock,\" and it was an absolute laughingstock. We've got the hottest nation right now in the whole world and the numbers are reflecting it too, so I just think it's great. And what I'll do is I'll sign this, then we can take a couple of questions if you want, and we will be finished, and you're going to go off and you're going to build the most beautiful automobiles for 20% less money. And I want to thank you, man, you have done some job. Thank you, Mike. Thank you, everybody. You guys want to come up here? Come on, sit around.\n\n(54:54)Okay, we're going to sign three bills that do everything I just said. No auto pens allowed. That's for you. Keep that, Mike. That pen was so good, give it back to me.\n\nSpeaker 4 (55:52):\n\n[inaudible 00:55:53]\n\nDonald Trump (55:52):\n\nThat was a good one, I'll sign all three of them, because you never know what you get with [inaudible 00:55:58] number two. Very steady hand, it's very important, very steady. Only a steady hand can sign like that.\n\nSpeaker 4 (56:25):\n\nAbsolutely.\n\nDonald Trump (56:25):\n\nI've been told that, actually. And here's number three. And it all goes into effect, everything I said goes into effect, lower prices, better cars and choice.\n\nSpeaker 5 (56:36):\n\nCommon sense.\n\nDonald Trump (56:36):\n\nYou can say choice. We have choice for education and you have choice for cars now. Common sense is right.\n\nSpeaker 5 (56:41):\n\nRight, common sense.\n\nDonald Trump (56:43):\n\nYou're right. Common sense is right. Okay. Now, I can give you the pen. I'll give you these [inaudible 00:56:55] congratulations.\n\nSpeaker 6 (56:55):\n\nThank you, Mr. President.\n\nDonald Trump (57:07):\n\nOkay. Take these. Pass these around, fellas.\n\nSpeaker 6 (57:10):\n\nWhere's John James [inaudible 00:57:11].\n\nJohn James (57:11):\n\nOh, thank you.\n\nDonald Trump (57:13):\n\nDo you have one, John?\n\nJohn James (57:14):\n\nYes, sir. Thank you, Mr. President.\n\nDonald Trump (57:18):\n\nPass them around. Okay, everybody. There's a few extra, you're going to take them [inaudible 00:57:37] okay.\n\n(57:38)Go ahead, please.\n\nCrowd (57:38):\n\n[inaudible 00:57:39]\n\nDonald Trump (57:46):\n\nAll right, Brian, yeah, please.\n\nBrian (57:50):\n\nI have some very close friends who run some of the largest auto dealerships in Southern California, [inaudible 00:57:56].\n\nDonald Trump (57:55):\n\nGood.\n\nBrian (57:58):\n\nTheir message is to you, they're 100% behind you right now, they know they're going through some soft sales period.\n\nDonald Trump (58:05):\n\nIt's true.\n\nBrian (58:05):\n\nThey're in it for the long haul. What's your message to thousands of auto dealerships across this country that are navigating through this territory?\n\nDonald Trump (58:13):\n\nYeah, they're going to do better than ever before, they're going to sell cars in America at levels that they've never even thought of before, and they're going to make more money than they ever made before. It's going to be great. They're going to be selling a better car too, it's going to be a better product.\n\nBrian (58:27):\n\nAnd they're behind you, 100%.\n\nDonald Trump (58:29):\n\nI know, I know that, they have been behind me. They knew it was right. They've been asking for this for 25, 30 years, in all fairness, they're very happy. I told you, the Auto Workers Union, we got tremendous votes. But they like me today even better than they did on election day on November 5th, because they see the results now, they're all happening.\n\nBrian (58:52):\n\nThey said thank you.\n\nDonald Trump (58:52):\n\nYeah, and they have plants moving in. Brian, a lot of plants are moving in. Thank you very much for that question.\n\nCrowd (58:55):\n\n[inaudible 00:58:57].\n\nDonald Trump (58:59):\n\nYeah.\n\nSpeaker 7 (58:59):\n\n[inaudible 00:58:59] the auto industry then.\n\nDonald Trump (59:04):\n\nOh, he was killing the auto industry. I don't think he knew it, I think he's a guy who… He's just got a faulty thought process. You look at that train, the train is the most… I've seen people, stupid people with cost overruns, for years I've watched, where something would cost twice as much or three times. But this thing is costing 20 times more, it's the most incredible disaster I've ever seen, that's one. The cars are just as bad, everything's bad, and now you have this situation.\n\n(59:39)So his own sheriff, who's a good man, by the way, said two days ago or three days ago that we could not have done this without the military, they were going to take over this whole… They couldn't have done it. Now, today, they got him to change his tune. He said, \"Oh, I think we could have handled it.\" It's so sad. He was so honest. I was using his quote all over the place and they got him to change. But he knows, Los Angeles would be right now burning to the ground, just like their houses burned to the ground.\n\n(01:00:09)It's so sad, what's going on in Los Angeles. Think of it. They had a fire they should have never had because they should have listened to me in the water. Eventually, we broke in and we had the water come down from the Pacific Northwest. I could show you pictures now with the big half pipes coming all the way down California. Water, so much water. They don't have any droughts, they have so much water. They sent it all out to the Pacific Ocean for 20 years, so ridiculous. We got them to take it now.\n\n(01:00:42)But what they do and what they're doing, this is a big problem. And what they really want to do is keep criminals, because they're trying to protect criminals. Sanctuary cities are a disaster in this country, and most of the voters don't want them. Politicians like them for whatever reason, but I think the politicians are wrong. That's why we won in such a convincing fashion. We won all seven swing states, we won by millions of votes. We won 2,750 districts as opposed to 505. That's why, when you look at the map, it's almost all red. It's got two little blue stripes on each side of it, it's almost all red. But now you have to…\n\n(01:01:24)I always got along with Gavin, I like Gavin, I've liked him always. He said I never called him. They asked him a question on Fox, I guess. I never spoke to him, he doesn't remember the call, he doesn't remember I never spoke. And then, I produced a phone call, I had it, it took me about two minutes. I said, \"Well, here's the call. It lasted 16 minutes and four seconds, and it was at 12:30 in the evening.\" I actually made a call, he didn't pick up. I called him a second time and he picked up. And I told him, I said, \"You have to get your ass in gear because you're going to have a problem there.\" And he would've, if we didn't bring the military in, you would have right now something…\n\n(01:02:06)And I went through it, because I follow the rules 100%, and I watched in Minnesota where you have the men who ran for Vice President of the United States fortunately, he was a disaster, but he wouldn't call in the National Guard. And I eventually called in the National Guard, but it was seven days late. I said, \"I'll never do that again.\" If I see problems brewing, if they're not going to deal with the problem, I'm not going to wait two weeks, because that city, Minneapolis burned down. If you remember the CNN anchor, he was standing there saying, \"Yes, this is a peaceful rally,\" and behind him, the entire city was on fire. It looked like World War Two. I appreciate the question.\n\nCrowd (01:02:49):\n\n[inaudible 01:02:51].\n\nDonald Trump (01:02:52):\n\nPlease.\n\nSpeaker 8 (01:02:53):\n\nMr. President, thank you very much for [inaudible 01:02:54].\n\nDonald Trump (01:02:53):\n\nThank you.\n\nSpeaker 8 (01:02:53):\n\nFirst, the terrible, horrific plane crash in India\n\nSpeaker 9 (01:03:00):\n\n… [inaudible 01:03:00] on TV. Your reaction to that first, and will you speak to Prime Minister Modi?\n\nDonald Trump (01:03:06):\n\nThe plane crash was terrible. I've already told them anything we can do. It's a big country, a strong country. They'll handle it, I'm sure, but I let them know that anything we can do, we'll be over there immediately. But it was a horrific crash. It looks like most are gone. They actually maybe have a couple survivors, which is just hurt. But that was a horrible crash. Nobody has any idea what it might be. I gave them a couple of pointers. I said, \"Maybe you'll look at this or that.\" We saw the plane. It looked like it was flying pretty well. It didn't look like there was an explosion. It just looked like the engines maybe lost power. But boy, that is a terrible crash. It's one of the worst in aviation history. Yeah. Second.\n\nSpeaker 9 (01:03:50):\n\n[inaudible 01:03:49]. How confident you, sir, that conflict with Iran can be avoided?\n\nDonald Trump (01:03:55):\n\nWell, I'd love to avoid the conflict. Iran is going to have to negotiate a little bit tougher, meaning they're going to have to give us some things that they're not willing to give us right now. I'm the last person… I've kept this out of wars. We defeated ISIS completely, a hundred percent, and I haven't had a… It's peace through strength. I believe in peace through strength. We're the greatest military in the world. I rebuilt the military, as you remember, for four years. I rebuilt the military and then we gave a chunk of it away, but it was still peanuts. It was a lot, but it was peanuts compared to what we rebuilt, gave it to Afghanistan. One of the most embarrassing moments in the history of our country with the whole withdrawal. The way they withdrew was very embarrassing. But we rebuilt the military. We have the greatest, strongest military. We defeated ISIS. We defeated ISIS.\n\n(01:04:52)We defeated ISIS in four weeks. It was told to be five years, it was going to take five years, anywhere from four to five years. We did it in four weeks with the way headed by the general who's now the head of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. That's why he's there. He said it would be take four weeks and he did it in four weeks. He did actually a little bit faster. So we have a great country and we're going to keep it that way. And when it comes to Los Angeles or other cities, if we see other cities are gearing up… And these people are agitators, they're paid, they're professionals, they're insurrectionists, they're troublemakers, they're all of those things. But I believe they're paid. And we're going to find out through Pam Bondi and her great staff or great people just as who they are.\n\n(01:05:40)And Mike, I think you're doing some investigations in that in Congress, but we're going to find out who they are because I think what they're doing is unbelievably illegal. Just one thing. So they took the bricks away from people. They're walking in with satchels of bricks. Now, why do you have bricks? You have bricks because you throw bricks. They're very potent. If they hit you, they kill you. And they took them away. The military took them away. They saw him. What the hell is this? The guy could hardly carry. He had many bricks. He's strong guy, couldn't carry them. And they saw that and they took them away. Then they found others with bricks. But they're ingenious. They also brought hammers along, very heavy hammers. And I saw them pounding the curb and pounding the sidewalk. And it was like a military operation.\n\n(01:06:28)This guy's pounding strong, boom, big shots. And it was breaking up granite, the granite curbs. And the granite was breaking up and the concrete was breaking up and there was lines of people standing there and handing them, and then he stopped handing them. They just went down and picked him up. It was so professional. I said, \"That's a professional organization.\" This is not like people at random. This guy's breaking up because they couldn't use the bricks. So who would think of this even? Did a lot of damage. A lot of curbs are broken. A lot of sidewalks broken. But I never saw that before. That's one I haven't seen. I thought I saw it all. And they have it on tape. And with that, people get killed. They go to the bridges and they drop the concrete off the top of the bridge with a car coming along at 70 miles an hour and the person dies.\n\n(01:07:16)And we had a lot of car problems. You saw that. They were all over the road. They were littered all over the road where the cars got stopped by concrete going through the front windshield. Now these are bad people. If we didn't go, Los Angeles right now would be on fire. It would be a disaster, and we stopped it. And last night was very good. Nobody showed up. You know why they didn't show up? Because we were there. If it was just the police, because the police are great. I know those police, they're great, but they're told not to do anything. They're not allowed to act. Thank you.\n\nReporters (01:07:49):\n\nMr. President. Mr. President.\n\nSpeaker 11 (01:07:49):\n\nMr. President.\n\nSpeaker 10 (01:07:54):\n\nMr. President, how imminent is the Israeli strike on Iran?\n\nDonald Trump (01:08:00):\n\nWell, I don't want to say imminent, but it looks like it's something that could very well happen. Look, it's very simple, not complicated. Iran cannot have a nuclear weapon. Other than that, I want them to be successful. We'll help them be successful. We'll trade with them. We'll do whatever is necessary. I stopped a war between India and Pakistan and I stopped it with trade. I don't think I've ever seen a story written about it, but it was pretty cool. They were getting ready. Pakistan was their turn to hit, and eventually they're going to go nuclear, and I stopped it. I called each. I respect each leader greatly. I know them. And I spoke to them and I talked about trade.\n\n(01:08:42)I said, \"But you're not trading with us if you're going to go to war if you're going to start throwing nuclear weapons around.\" And I said it to both of them. And they were both unbelievable actually. They understood it exactly. They stopped. I stopped that war with phone calls and trade. And India's here right now negotiating a trade deal, and Pakistan is coming I think next week, and I'm very proud of that. Nobody died. The nuclear weapons, they each have very severe, very substantial numbers of nuclear weapons. And I think we should get some credit for that. The whole Republican Party should, because that's their mindset. Please.\n\nSpeaker 12 (01:09:21):\n\n[inaudible 01:09:24].\n\nDonald Trump (01:09:25):\n\nYes, ma'am. What?\n\nSpeaker 12 (01:09:26):\n\n[inaudible 01:09:27], Mr. President. Are you still concerned about national security issues that Chinese students [inaudible 01:09:34]?\n\nDonald Trump (01:09:34):\n\nLook, I've always been in favor of students coming in from other countries. That includes China and we have 500,000 Chinese students coming in. I've always been in favor of it. Does it mean that you have to watch people? Yeah, you have to watch students, but you have to watch other people also. I've always been strongly in favor of it. I think it's a great thing. It's good for our schools. I think it's good for our country. I am also in favor of having them stay. I've been in favor of letting them stay. If you get educated for four years, you're willing to get educated for four years. I like people being able to stay. They have some great students. These are Republicans clapping because a lot of Republicans don't like that idea.\n\n(01:10:20)I happen to like it. I'm a real Republican, believe it or not, but I like the idea they go four years. To me, that's almost like just buying your way in a very legitimate way. And you have stories where Apple wants to hire somebody and they can't hire because he can't stay. He went to a great school. He finished first in his class. They made him a big offer and everything's done, but he has no idea whether or not he is going to be able to stay.\n\n(01:10:49)And I'm all for making sure that people like that can go to work for all of our great companies. And you know what they do? They go back to their country and there are stories that are all over the place. They go back to their company and they start a company just like they were going to start here. They end up starting it in China or India or someplace else, and now they're among the richest people in the world. They've got thousands and thousands of employees that make a great… This is happening all the time because they're not allowed to stay. I think we'll probably end up doing something about that, right?\n\nReporters (01:11:21):\n\nMr. President.\n\nSpeaker 13 (01:11:21):\n\nMr. President.\n\nDonald Trump (01:11:26):\n\nYeah, go ahead. Go ahead. You in the blue, please, light blue.\n\nSpeaker 14 (01:11:34):\n\nThank you, Mr. President. How [inaudible 01:11:35] are you to step back home between Ukraine and Russia to see a very bad escalation? Are you going to [inaudible 01:11:40] go here?\n\nDonald Trump (01:11:40):\n\nI'm very close to the situation. I'm very disappointed in Russia, but I'm disappointed in Ukraine also because I think deals could have been made and we're losing five, 6,000 people a week, soldiers mostly but also people living in towns because they're getting hit by missiles again. How would you like to live in a building and you think a missile has a good chance of hitting your building during the evening? It's horrible. It must be horrible to live like that. I mean, we'll get it, but I'm disappointed that it's not done. We did great with India and Pakistan. We did very good with Israel. I thought, look, October 7th was a disaster. People forget. They like to forget. That was a horrible thing. But none of these things would've happened if I were president. If I were president, none of it would've happened. You wouldn't have the Israel problem. Iran was broke. They had no money. We had big sanctions on them. Biden immediately let them get rich. The 300 billion they have right now. But they had no money for Hamas or Hezbollah. They had no money for anything. It was perfect.\n\n(01:12:47)We wouldn't have had inflation that was caused by oil. Chris, the oil price went through the roof. It was also caused by their spending, but it was caused more by oil than anything else. The oil went so high, got close to a hundred dollars a barrel. And that also kept the war going with Putin because a hundred dollars a barrel, that was a big money-making experience. But now it's down to where it's not so good for them anymore. No, it's very important to get that sell. That's a bloodbath. That's a terrible bloodbath that's going on. Yeah, please go ahead.\n\nSpeaker 15 (01:13:20):\n\nMr. President.\n\nSpeaker 16 (01:13:20):\n\n[inaudible 01:13:21].\n\nSpeaker 15 (01:13:24):\n\nMr. President.\n\nSpeaker 17 (01:13:24):\n\n[inaudible 01:13:25] again Pakistan. First off, [inaudible 01:13:28]. They cannot talk to Pakistan unless Pakistan takes actions [inaudible 01:13:32].\n\nDonald Trump (01:13:33):\n\nWe're going to get those two getting together. I told them, India and Pakistan, they've had a long-time-\n\nSpeaker 18 (01:13:40):\n\nCan we just use this?\n\nDonald Trump (01:13:40):\n\n… rivalry over Kashmir.\n\nSpeaker 19 (01:13:42):\n\nYeah, [inaudible 01:13:42]. Okay, yeah.\n\nDonald Trump (01:13:44):\n\nI said, \"I can solve anything. I'll be your arbitrator. I will be your arbitrator. I can solve anything.\" And I saw the first question, how long is it'd be going along?\n\nSpeaker 19 (01:13:50):\n\nThey said they only use this one.\n\nDonald Trump (01:13:50):\n\nThey said 2000 years. I said, \"Oh, that's a [inaudible 01:13:59].\"\n\nReporters (01:13:50):\n\nMr. President.\n\nSpeaker 20 (01:13:50):\n\n[inaudible 01:14:03].\n\nSpeaker 21 (01:13:50):\n\nOn Biden, Mr. President.\n\nDonald Trump (01:14:06):\n\nWhen I heard 2000 years, they said, maybe I'll have John Hess solve that problem.\n\nReporters (01:14:09):\n\nMr. President.\n\nSpeaker 23 (01:14:09):\n\n[inaudible 01:14:10].\n\nSpeaker 22 (01:14:09):\n\nMr. President, will you punish Israel for striking Iran?\n\nSpeaker 21 (01:14:09):\n\nOn Biden, Mr. President, on Biden.\n\nDonald Trump (01:14:09):\n\nPeter.\n\nSpeaker 24 (01:14:14):\n\nThank you, President Trump. I have two. First on immigration. What made you change your mind about targeting in California farmers and people in the hotel and leisure business?\n\nDonald Trump (01:14:27):\n\nWell, we're not targeting. In fact, if you look today, I put out a statement today about farmers. Our farmers are being hurt badly by… They have very good workers. They've worked for them for 20 years. They're not citizens, but they've turned out to be great, and we're going to have to do something about that. We can't take farmers and take all their people and send them back because they don't have maybe what they're supposed to have, maybe not.\n\n(01:14:53)And you know it's going to happen. And what is happening? They get rid of some of the people because you go into a farm and you look and people don't… They've been there for 20, 25 years and they've worked great and the owner of the farm loves them and everything else and then you're supposed to throw them out. And you know what happens? They end up hiring the people, the criminals that have come in, the murderers from prisons and everything else. So we're going to have an order on that pretty soon. I think we can't do that to our farmers and leisure too, hotels. We're going to have to use a lot of common sense on that.\n\nSpeaker 24 (01:15:25):\n\nAnd my other question about the Middle East, as the Israelis apparently gear up for some kind of an attack, a possible attack on Iran, are you trying to talk Netanyahu out of doing that, or are you so against Iran having a nuclear weapon that you're okay, he does his thing because it's not an American [inaudible 01:15:45]?\n\nDonald Trump (01:15:44):\n\nYeah, it's a very fair question. Look, I want to have an agreement with Iran. We're fairly close to an agreement. We are fairly close to a pretty good agreement. It's got to be better than pretty good though but it's got to be… I much prefer an agreement. As long as I think there is an agreement, I don't want them going in because I think that would blow it. It might help it actually, but it also could blow it. But we've had very good discussions with Iran. Whether or not we get there, I can't tell you, but it'll happen soon. I say this, Peter, very strongly, whether it's going in or not going in, they can't have a nuclear weapon. I'd prefer the more friendly path.\n\nSpeaker 24 (01:16:26):\n\nAnd can you tell us what the Israelis told you [inaudible 01:16:29] to evacuate the dependents of servicemen and women who are stationed in the Middle East?\n\nDonald Trump (01:16:34):\n\nThey didn't tell me anything, but I said, \"Look, there's a chance of massive conflict. We have a lot of American people in this area.\" And I said, \"We got to tell them to get out because something could happen soon.\" And I don't want to be the one that didn't give any warning and missiles are flying into their buildings. It's possible. So I had to do it. I had the choice, do I do it or not doing? Doing it has its downside, but it also has its upside, like you could save a lot of lives if it should happen. Hopefully that doesn't happen. Right. Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 25 (01:17:06):\n\nMr. President.\n\nSpeaker 26 (01:17:06):\n\n[inaudible 01:17:07].\n\nSpeaker 27 (01:17:06):\n\n[inaudible 01:17:07].\n\nSpeaker 25 (01:17:07):\n\nMr. President. Thank you, Mr. President. For Americans that are coming to Washington on Saturday for military parade-\n\nDonald Trump (01:17:17):\n\nIt'll be a great day.\n\nSpeaker 25 (01:17:18):\n\n… what would you like folks to take away from that day? What would you hope that they would remember?\n\nDonald Trump (01:17:24):\n\nHow great our country is, very simple and how strong our military is. We have the strongest military in the world. It's very interesting. Three weeks ago, it was the end of world anniversary, end of World War II, and I called France, and Macron was a good man. I said, \"What are you doing?\" He goes, \"We're celebrating World War II, our victory.\" I said, \"You're victory. You're victory. Tell me about that.\" And then I called somebody else and I happened to speak to President Putin at the time. Now, in all fairness to him, he lost 51 million people and he did fight. Russia fought. Sort of interesting, isn't it? He fought with us in World War II and everybody hates him and Germany and Japan, they're fine. Someday somebody will explain that. But I like Germany and Japan too. But Putin is a little confused by that. He said, \"We lost 51 million people and we were your ally and now everybody hates Russia and they love Germany and Japan.\"\n\n(01:18:25)I said, \"Let's explain that sometime, okay?\" But it's a strange world. But I will say this, look, I want them to go away saying how great our country is and how great our military is. And I was making all these calls. For some reason, I spoke to four different places. \"Sir, you're celebrating.\" And I said, \"We won World War II and World War I, right? We won them, and yet we're the only country that doesn't celebrate. Everybody's celebrating except us.\" And I said, \"We should celebrate too.\"\n\nSpeaker 28 (01:18:55):\n\n[inaudible 01:18:57].\n\nSpeaker 29 (01:18:55):\n\nMr. President.\n\nSpeaker 30 (01:18:58):\n\nMr. President.\n\nSpeaker 25 (01:18:59):\n\nThere are several No Kings protests planned across the country on Saturday as well. What are your thoughts on those?\n\nDonald Trump (01:19:05):\n\nWhat are they called? No King?\n\nSpeaker 25 (01:19:06):\n\nNo Kings.\n\nDonald Trump (01:19:06):\n\nI don't feel like a king. I have to go through hell to get stuff approved. A king would say, \"I'm not going to get this.\" A king would've never had the California mandate to even be talking to him. He wouldn't have to call up Mike Johnson and Thune and say, \"Fellas, you got to pull this off. And after years, we get it done.\" No, no, we're not a king. We're not a king at all. Thank you very much.\n\nSpeaker 31 (01:19:27):\n\nMr. President.\n\nSpeaker 29 (01:19:28):\n\nMr. President. [inaudible 01:19:29].\n\nDonald Trump (01:19:30):\n\nGo ahead. Yeah. Go ahead.\n\nSpeaker 32 (01:19:31):\n\nMr. President.\n\nSpeaker 33 (01:19:32):\n\nMr. President, sir, you made a lengthy posting today on Truth Social about Senator Rand Paul. Do you expect to see him at the picnic tonight, sir?\n\nDonald Trump (01:19:39):\n\nI do. I look forward to seeing him actually. I like him. He's the hardest vote in the history of the US Senate to get… Probably won't get him, but he's a very tough vote. I mean, he's a very tough vote. He's always been a friend of mine. I endorsed him and got him elected. I got him elected twice. But I don't think he understands how great this bill is. This is a great bill. No tax on tips, no tax on the social security payments. It's unbelievable what happens. No tax on overtime. You work overtime, no more tax. Those are big, but they're minor compared to the big things. Taxes reduced. And let's look at the other side. If it doesn't get approved, a 68% tax increase, 68%, including the fact that the Trump tax cuts kick in, but it's a 68% tax increase and many other bad things. Some of them are so bad, I don't even want to talk about them.\n\n(01:20:41)I think it's one of the greatest bills we'll ever pass in this country. And I think that leader Thune and this gentleman right here, what he's gone through on this with… We started off with a majority of one. Now I guess we have seven, so it's easier, but it's really sort of three. It's seven, but it really equates to three, right? And we have great support. I mean, I can't tell you, I can't guarantee, but when you have a majority of essentially three where you can't lose anything more than three votes and you get it passed, it's pretty amazing. And I think it's going to haunt the Democrats because most of the bill is common sense. It's tax cuts, it's border wall funding, it's military funding properly spent.\n\n(01:21:31)It's all things that are like common sense. They're all good. There's nothing tricky about it. It's basic stuff. And we don't intend on getting one. Think of it, not one Democrat vote in the House, Mike, not one. Maybe somebody will come along. I don't know how they can run for office. So many different things. Very important. Medicare and Medicaid are going to be strengthened, not hurt. They're using fake narrative. Now they're going to be strengthened. We're going to strengthen them. They're going to destroy them because under their policies, Medicare and Medicaid go away. Social security under them is going to be devastated. With us, it's going to be kept but much stronger than before. And very interestingly, I saw this and I proved it because for four years I never hurt Medicare, Medicaid or Social Security. I've already been there. But they're going to destroy Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security. They're going to wipe them out in my opinion, because their policies are so bad, the country will have no money to pay for them. We're going to make them stronger than ever before. Thank you very much everybody.",

    "transcript": "Speaker 1 (00:00):\n\n(silence)\n\nDonald Trump (13:22):\n\n… and why now I can say that it can't come soon enough. Frankly, we want to keep bad people out of our country. The Biden Administration allowed some horrendous people and we're getting them out one by one and we're not stopping until we get them out. We have thousands of murderers. I even hate to say this in front of the Chancellor because you have a little problem too with some of the people that were allowed into your country getting.\n\nFriedrich Merz (13:47):\n\nIt's getting smaller.\n\nDonald Trump (13:47):\n\nIt's not your fault. It's not your fault. It shouldn't have happened. I told her it shouldn't have happened what she did, but you have your own difficulty with that. And we do and we're moving them out and we're moving them out very strongly. But it can't come fast enough. We want to get them out, we want to get them out now. We don't want to have other bad people coming into our country, but using the word bad, I'm being nice. Okay, question, please.\n\nSpeaker 2 (14:11):\n\nMr. President, you put out on Truth Social a post regarding your conversation with President Xi.\n\nDonald Trump (14:17):\n\nRight.\n\nSpeaker 2 (14:18):\n\nCan you talk about whether or not you feel that trade talks, trade relations are back on track after appearing to be a little bit off track last week?\n\nDonald Trump (14:27):\n\nA little bit off track. It was only the complexity. It's pretty complex stuff. We had a very good conversation with President Xi a little while ago, just before your arrival. In fact, we just hung up and they said you're here. I said, \"That's pretty good. Two great leaders of the world in a very short period of time.\" We had a very good talk and we've straightened out any complexity. It's very complex stuff and we straighten it out. The agreement was we're going to have Scott and Howard and Jameson will be going and meeting with their top people and continue it forward. But no, I think we have everything. I think we're in very good shape with China and the trade deal. We have a deal with China, as you know, but we were straightening out some of the points having to do mostly with rare earth magnets and some other things.\n\nSpeaker 2 (15:24):\n\nSo those reduced trade tariff rates, they remain in effect?\n\nDonald Trump (15:28):\n\nYeah, we have the deal. I mean, we've had a deal. We announced the deal and we'll be, I guess you could say, I wouldn't even say finalizing it up, Scott. I would say we have a deal and we're going to just make sure that everybody understands what the deal is. Okay. We had a really good conversation. By the way, he invited me to China and I invited him here and we both accepted. So I'll be going there with the First lady at a certain point and he'll be coming here hopefully with the First Lady of China. Go ahead please.\n\nSpeaker 4 (16:00):\n\nDid you talk about the Chinese students? Are you allowing them to come to the U.S.?\n\nDonald Trump (16:07):\n\nOkay. Chinese students are coming. No problem, no problem. It's our honor to have them, frankly. Look, we want have want to have foreign students, but we want them to be checked. In the case of Harvard and Columbia and others, all we want to do is see their list. There's no problem with that. This is anybody outside of our country, international students, because when we see some of the people that we've been watching, we say, \"Where do these people come from?\" How is that possible? No, we want to have foreign students come. We're very honored by it, but we want to see their list. Harvard didn't want to give us the list. They're going to be giving us the list now. I think they're starting to behave, actually, if you want to know the truth.\n\nSpeaker 5 (16:50):\n\nMr. President on Russia, are you willing to put more pressure on Putin to end the war by imposing new sanctions on Russia and also on China?\n\nDonald Trump (17:00):\n\nWell, remember, I'm the one that ended Nord Stream 2 going to a place called Germany come to think of and I'm sorry I did that. I don't know. But I ended Nord Stream 2. Nobody else did. And then when Biden came in, he immediately approved it. That's essentially the largest pipeline in the world going to Germany and other countries, and by the way, we have so much oil and gas, you will not be able to buy it all. I mean, literally we have so much, and I hope we're going to make that a part of our trade deal because we have more than anybody else. We have actually the most by far in the world, probably double what anyone else says, so we'll work on that. I'm sure that's something we'll discuss today.\n\nSpeaker 6 (17:40):\n\nMr. President, what do you expect from Germany and what do you expect from the Chancellor?\n\nDonald Trump (17:45):\n\nWell, first of all, I'm glad to meet because I've been dealing with the Chancellor and he's a, very good man to deal with. He's difficult, I would say. Can I say that? It's a positive.\n\nFriedrich Merz (17:56):\n\nGo ahead.\n\nDonald Trump (17:56):\n\nYou wouldn't want me to say you're easy, right?\n\nFriedrich Merz (17:58):\n\nNo.\n\nDonald Trump (17:59):\n\nYeah. He's a very great representative of Germany. I think all we want is just going to have a good relationship. The rest will just sort of follow very easily. We'll have a good trade deal. I mean, I guess that will be mostly determined by the European Union-\n\nFriedrich Merz (18:14):\n\nYeah, that's true.\n\nDonald Trump (18:14):\n\n… but you're a very big part of that, so you'll be involved. But we'll end up hopefully with a trade deal or we'll do something. We'll do the tariffs. I mean, I'm okay with the tariffs or we make a deal with the trade and I guess that's what we're discussing now. Back there, please go ahead.\n\nSpeaker 5 (18:36):\n\nIs Germany doing enough on defense, Mr. President? Is Germany doing enough on defense?\n\nDonald Trump (18:41):\n\nWhat?\n\nSpeaker 5 (18:41):\n\nDefense spending?\n\nSpeaker 7 (18:42):\n\nIs Germany doing enough on defense spending? Is Germany doing enough a defense?\n\nSpeaker 5 (18:47):\n\nThe Chancellor wants to spend 3.5 billion-\n\nDonald Trump (18:48):\n\nWell, I don't know. I mean, I haven't discussed it very much. I know that you're spending more money on defense now and quite a bit more money and that's a positive thing.\n\nFriedrich Merz (18:58):\n\nYeah, definitely.\n\nDonald Trump (18:59):\n\nI'm not sure the General MacArthur would've said it's positive. He wouldn't like it, but I sort of think it's good. You understand what I mean by that?\n\nFriedrich Merz (19:07):\n\nAbsolutely, I understand.\n\nDonald Trump (19:08):\n\nHe made a statement, \"Never let Germany rearm.\" And I said, I always think about that when he says, \"Sir, we're spending more money on defense.\" They say, \"Oh, is that a good thing or a bad thing?\" I think it's a good thing, but at least to a certain point, there'll be a point when I'll say \"Please don't arm anymore. If you don't mind.\" We'll be watching him. I'll get it.\n\nSpeaker 8 (19:32):\n\nOn Biden, Mr President.\n\nDonald Trump (19:34):\n\nYeah, Biden. You said Biden.\n\nSpeaker 8 (19:34):\n\nYou say your predecessor dismissed your autopen investigation. He said he made all the decisions during his presidency. I'm curious reaction to his dismissal?\n\nDonald Trump (19:45):\n\nWell, look, the autopen, I think is the big scandal outside of the rigged Election of 2020. I think the biggest scandal of the last many years is the autopen and who's using it? I happen to think I know because I'm here and I'm not a big autopen person, fortunately, I'm glad. I'm very glad. It's an easy way out, but it's a very bad thing, very dangerous. I sign important documents. Usually when they put documents in front of you, they're important. Even if you're signing ambassadorships, I consider that important, I think it's inappropriate you have somebody that's devoting four years of their life or more to being an ambassador, I think that person deserves to get a real signature, not an autopen signature, and I can tell autopen easily. I can look at it like two little pinholes from pulling the paper, right?\n\nFriedrich Merz (20:34):\n\nYeah.\n\nDonald Trump (20:35):\n\nYou always see the pinholes. It's real easy to tell about autopen. I think it's very disrespectful to people when they get an autopen signature. Outside autopen to me are used when thousands of letters come in from young people all over the country and you want to get them back, and people use autopens for that, to send a little signature at the bottom of a letter where you have thousands of them. We get thousands of letters a week and it's not possible to do. I'd like to do it myself, but you can't do it.\n\n(21:07)To me, that's where autopens start and stop. But I'm sure that he didn't know many of the things. Look, he was never for open borders. He was never for transgender for everybody. He was never for men playing in women's sports. I mean, all of these things that changed so radically, I don't think he had any idea that what was… Frankly, I said it during the debate and I say it now, he didn't have much of an idea what was going on. I mean, essentially whoever used the autopen was the president, and that is wrong, it's illegal, it's so bad and it's so disrespectful to our country.\n\nSpeaker 9 (21:49):\n\nMr. President, will you leave your troops in Germany? And if I may ask a question to the Chancellor answer in German, for the German audience, how is your first encounter been?\n\nDonald Trump (22:03):\n\nThe answer is yes. We'll talk about that, but if they'd like to have them there-\n\nSpeaker 9 (22:06):\n\n[inaudible 00:22:08]\n\nDonald Trump (22:08):\n\n… we have a lot of them. About 45,000. It's a lot of troops. It's a city when you think of-\n\nFriedrich Merz (22:13):\n\nMore than that, yeah.\n\nDonald Trump (22:14):\n\nThat's good economic development. They're highly paid troops and they spend a lot of money in Germany, but the relationship with Germany is very important. Yeah, we'll be doing that. No problem.\n\nFriedrich Merz (22:24):\n\nMay I say a few words in German to the Germans public?\n\nDonald Trump (22:41):\n\nYes, please.\n\nFriedrich Merz (22:41):\n\nSo [German 00:22:42]\n\nDonald Trump (22:46):\n\nBecause you speak such good English, is it as good as your German, would you say? Do you feel more comfortable in your mother tongue?\n\nFriedrich Merz (22:52):\n\nNo, it's not my mother tongue, but I try to understand almost everything and to speak as good as I can.\n\nDonald Trump (22:58):\n\nYeah, very good. It's an achievement actually.\n\nFriedrich Merz (23:03):\n\nThank you.\n\nDonald Trump (23:03):\n\n[inaudible 00:23:05]\n\nSpeaker 3 (23:05):\n\nThank you, Mr. President. The criticism that I've seen, and I'm sure you've seen, regarding Elon Musk and your big beautiful bill, what's your reaction to that? Do you think it in any way hurts passage in the Senate, which of course, what is your seeking?\n\nDonald Trump (23:17):\n\nWell, look, I've always liked Elon and I was very surprised you saw the words he had from me, the words, and he hasn't said anything about me that's bad. I'd rather have him criticize me than the bill because the bill is incredible. It's the biggest cut in the history of our country. It's about 1.6 trillion in cuts. It's the biggest tax cut, you would say people's taxes will go way down, but it's the biggest tax cut in history. We are doing things in that bill that are unbelievable, and when you look at what we're doing for small businesses, for people, for middle income people, all of the things that we're doing, nobody's ever seen anything like it. And Elon's upset because we took the EV mandate, which was a lot of money for electric vehicles, and they're having a hard time, the electric vehicles, and they want us to pay billions of dollars in subsidy and Elon knew this from the beginning.\n\n(24:22)He knew it for a long time ago. That's been in there. I would say, JD, that hasn't changed. That's been right from the beginning, I think, Mr. Secretary that hasn't changed at all, right from the beginning. But I know that it disturbed him. He wanted, and rightfully he recommended somebody from that he, I guess, knew very well. I'm sure he respected him to run NASA and I didn't think it was appropriate and he happened to be a Democrat, totally Democrat. And I say, \"Look, we won. We get certain privileges and one of the privileges, we don't have to appoint a Democrat.\" NASA is very important. We have great people. General Caine is going to be picking somebody with our… We'll be checking them out, seeing, but he wanted that person, a certain person, and we said, \"No,\" and I can understand why he's upset.\n\n(25:17)Remember he was here for a long time. You saw a man who was very happy when he stood behind the Oval Desk and even with the black eye. I said, \"Do you want a little makeup? We'll get you little makeup.\" But he said, \"No, I don't think so.\" Which is interesting and very nice. He wants to be who he is. So you could make that statement too, I guess. Look, Elon and I had a great relationship. I don't know if we will anymore. I was surprised because you were here, everybody in this room practically was here as we had a wonderful send-off. He said wonderful things about me. You couldn't have nicer, said the best thing. He's worn the hat, \"Trump was right about everything,\" and I am right about the\n\nDonald Trump (26:00):\n\n… the great big, beautiful bill. We call it a great big, beautiful bill because that's what it is. And again, biggest tax cuts in history, biggest economic development moves anywhere. We've never done anything like it. Business is spurred. And I don't know if you've seen the numbers, but the numbers came out. Even the CBO, which is run by Democrats, said that we're going to be doing… You know, I'd like you to discuss it, the 2.8 trillion that CBO. This is a group of people that are Democrats. They're very hostile to us. They just came out with phenomenal numbers, what it does. You want to mention that, Scott?\n\nScott Bessent (26:38):\n\nYes, sir. So what we've seen is we keep hearing from the CBO that there's going to be a large deficit from the bill, which we disagree with, but using the CBO scoring, they came out and scored the tariff revenue. We think it'll be the minimum of 2.8 trillion over the 10-year window, which actually puts the bill in surplus if you include the tariff revenue, which they won't do.\n\nDonald Trump (27:02):\n\nIt gives you a tremendous surplus, but we're not allowed to use that for some reason. They say scoring. Nobody knows what scoring means. Maybe a couple of people, but nobody. Somebody sits in the background they say, \"Well, we're not going to allow that.\" They're not allowing other things that we have that are tremendously profitable for our country.\n\n(27:20)But if you saw the other day, CNBC, they came out with numbers. And the people on the show, very good people, I've watched them for a long time, they couldn't believe the numbers, how good they are. The numbers were incredible. And that was personal income and also very low inflation. We have very low inflation. We're down to 2% now and maybe even lower than that. And when I took it over, it was a mess.\n\n(27:43)Remember, we had the worst inflation probably in the history of our country. They say 48 years, but let's say that's… I think it's worse than that. So we had the worst inflation in the history of our country under the Biden administration. Now we're down to a beautiful number, 2%. You'd actually like to keep it there. Better than zero is 2%. It's going down maybe to one, and 1% is like perfect. That's perfect. You don't want to have zero for certain reasons that nobody is very interested to listen to.\n\n(28:16)But we have almost perfect inflation. Grocery prices are down, everything. Remember eggs? Eggs. We weren't going to buy another egg for the next 20 years they were so expensive, right? Remember? You guys all hit me about eggs. Eggs have come down 400%. Everybody has eggs now. They're having eggs for breakfast again.\n\n(28:34)But if you look at gasoline, very important. I think always the most important because it's the energy is the biggest factor. That's what happened. He screwed up our energy policy and everything went up because energy went up. But now energy is way down. And they have states where you're at $1.98 a gallon for gasoline.\n\n(28:55)So the costs have come way down. And one of the things I ran on was that. I ran on the border. We have the best border in the history of our country, 99.99%. It was last week three people came in. Two of them for medical reasons. We let them in because one of them had a heart attack. I think that was the nice thing to do. And one of them had something else. So we've never had… I had very good numbers for four years, but we've really topped it. And I want to thank Kristi and Tom Homan. They've done a fantastic job. But nobody mentions that anymore.\n\n(29:32)Remember, a few months ago, the border was a total disaster. People were coming in by the hundreds of thousands of people a day, a week, a month. I mean, we had a month, two million people came in one month. The border was being overrun, and a lot of bad people, criminals, murderers, drug dealers. We had some of the worst people in the world coming in from all over the world. It's totally closed. And you know what? People are coming into our country, but they're coming in legally. So we've done a great job.\n\n(30:04)Elon knew that. Elon endorsed me very strongly. He actually went up and campaigned for me. I think I would've won. Susie would say I would've won Pennsylvania easily anyway. Even if the governor ran, the real governor, not the governor from Minnesota who's, I mean, he's a sick puppy that guy. That poor guy, feel sorry for him. But they made a bad choice with him. But if you pick Shapiro or anybody else. I spoke to him recently about his house being set on fire, which was terrible. But if they picked him, I would've won Pennsylvania. I won it by a lot.\n\n(30:39)But I'm very disappointed because Elon knew the inner workings of this bill better than almost anybody sitting here, better than you people. He knew everything about it. He had no problem with it. All of a sudden, he had a problem. And he only developed the problem when he found out that we're going to have to cut the EV mandate because that's billions and billions of dollars. And it really is unfair. We want to have cars of all types. Electric. We want to have electric, but we want to have gasoline, combustion. We want to have different, we want to have hybrids. We want to be able to sell everything. And when that was cut and Congress wanted to cut it, he became a little bit different. And I can understand that. But he knew every aspect of this bill. He knew it better than almost anybody. And he never had a problem until right after he left.\n\n(31:28)And if you saw the statements he made about me, which I'm sure you can get very easily, it's very fresh on tape. He said the most beautiful things about me. And he hasn't said bad about me personally, but I'm sure that'll be next. But I'm very disappointed in Elon. I've helped Elon a lot.\n\nSpeaker 10 (31:44):\n\nMr. President, I just want to clarify, did he raise any of these concerns with you privately before he raised them publicly? And this is the guy you put in charge of cutting spending. Should people not take him seriously about spending now. Are you saying this is all sour grapes?\n\nDonald Trump (31:57):\n\nNo, he worked hard and he did a good job. And I'll be honest, I think he misses the place. I think he got out there and all of a sudden he wasn't in this beautiful Oval Office and he was… He's got nice offices too. But there's something about this one.\n\n(32:10)I was telling the Chancellor, this is where it is. People come in here, even from Germany, they come in and they-\n\nFriedrich Merz (32:16):\n\nEven from Germany, right.\n\nDonald Trump (32:17):\n\n… walk into the Oval Office, and it's just a special place. World War I it started and it ended here. And World War II and so many other things. Everything big comes right from this beautiful space. It's now much more beautiful than it was six months ago. A lot of good things are happening in this room.\n\n(32:37)And I'll tell you, he's not the first. People leave my administration and they love us. And then at some point, they miss it so badly. And some of them embrace it, and some of them actually become hostile. I don't know what it is. It's sort of Trump Derangement Syndrome, I guess they call it. But we have it with others too. They leave and they wake up in the morning and the glamour is gone, the whole world is different, and they become hostile. I don't know what it is. Someday you'll write a book about it and you'll let us know. Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 11 (33:13):\n\nMr. President, speaking of ending wars in this room, you were very critical of Vladimir Putin a couple of days ago. What kind of play is he playing from your perspective? What are his [inaudible 00:33:23]\n\nDonald Trump (33:23):\n\nWell, look, he got hit. He's been doing hitting, so I understand it. But he got hit hard. And I don't think he's playing games. I think he… I've always said he wanted the whole thing. I thought he wanted the entire, everything having to do with Ukraine. That's something that would've never happened if I were president. The election was rigged, I didn't get to be president, but I got to be president now.\n\n(33:49)And I think it's a much more important presidency other than a couple of things like that. The war would have never happened. The war with Ukraine, with Putin would've never happened, ever. Not even a chance. And it didn't happen for four years. And it wasn't thought of. I used to talk to him about Ukraine a lot. It was the apple of his eye, but he would've never done what he did. And I think mistakes were made by him. But I think mistakes were made by other people.\n\n(34:17)The President should have never allowed that war. Biden should have never allowed that war to happen. If you had the right guy in here, that war would've never happened. Israel would've never happened with Hamas. That would've never happened. The attack on Israel would've never happened because Iran was broke. They had no money. They had no money to give to Hamas or Hezbollah or anybody else. And all of that would've never happened.\n\n(34:43)Inflation wouldn't have happened. It was caused mostly by energy. And the Biden administration messed up my great energy policy. We were down into the 1.90 a gallon, and it would've never happened. It was caused by energy and their bad spending on the Green New Scam and other things that they spent on. But all of those things would've never happened.\n\n(35:03)But maybe most importantly, the war, Chancellor, with Russia would never have happened with Ukraine. It was something that would've… I dealt with Putin a lot. There was no chance, zero. And a lot of people say, \"How do you know?\" For four years it didn't happen. There was never a chance of it happening. And he understood the consequences. Now it's a shame.\n\n(35:30)And when you see all of those people. They came out with a report today that millions of people, millions of people died, much more than people thought. And I've been saying that for a long time. The amount of death in that war is far greater than the news has been reporting, or frankly, that either side has been reporting. It's a very sad thing.\n\n(35:53)And I can tell you, just speaking for the Chancellor, because we speak about it, he feels the same way. He wants to see it ended. Would you like to say something?\n\nFriedrich Merz (36:00):\n\nAbsolutely. And I'm here, Mr. President, to talk with you later on, on how we could contribute to that goal. And we all are looking for measures and for instruments to bring this terrible war to an end. And may I remind you that we are having June 6th tomorrow. This is D-Day anniversary when the Americans once ended a war in Europe. And I think this is in your hand, in specific in ours.\n\nDonald Trump (36:35):\n\nThat was not a pleasant day for you.\n\nFriedrich Merz (36:36):\n\nNo, that was not a pleasant… Well-\n\nDonald Trump (36:36):\n\nThis is not a great day.\n\nFriedrich Merz (36:37):\n\n… in the long run, Mr. President, this was the liberation of my country from Nazi dictatorship.\n\nDonald Trump (36:44):\n\nThat's true. That's true.\n\nFriedrich Merz (36:44):\n\nAnd we know what we owe you. But this is the reason why I'm saying that America is again in a very strong position to do something on this war and ending this war. So let's talk about what we can do jointly, and we are ready to do what we can. And you know that we gave support to Ukraine and that we are looking for more pressure on Russia. The European Union did, and we should talk about that.\n\nDonald Trump (37:09):\n\nWe will talk about it and it's good timing. The numbers for our country are through the roof, the economic numbers, because of the election and because of tariffs and other things, a lot of things. But we've had some of the best numbers we've ever had. They were reported yesterday, the day before and even today. Our country's doing really well. I think that one of the things you'd be most interested in is that six months ago, we were having a hard time getting anybody to join our military. I mean, they just couldn't do it. The numbers were record low. We couldn't get people to join the military. It wasn't me. This was before I got there, the past administration. But six months ago, a year ago, the numbers were record low. You couldn't get them to join. That included the police, and you couldn't get them to join. Now we just hit the highest number in the history of our country, we think, but very close, but the highest in the history of our country recruitment, joining the Army, Navy, Air Force, Marines, Coast Guard, police forces all over the country.\n\nFriedrich Merz (38:16):\n\nWhat did you do for that? What was the reason?\n\nDonald Trump (38:16):\n\nSpirit. They love our country again. You're going to do the same thing. Spirit.\n\nSpeaker 12 (38:21):\n\nMr. President…\n\nDonald Trump (38:22):\n\nWe have great spirit is back in our country and it's very simple. It was only, Susie, six months ago, right, that you got reports. You're the one that released them, that you couldn't get anybody to join the military. And now we're stocked. Every service now is packed. And we have waiting lists of people trying to get in, as good as we've ever had in the history of our country. So that's an honor.\n\nFriedrich Merz (38:45):\n\nYes.\n\nDonald Trump (38:45):\n\nThat's a great honor. Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 13 (38:47):\n\nMr. President, on the war…\n\nDonald Trump (38:48):\n\nYou've asked. You've had enough. Go ahead.\n\nSpeaker 14 (38:49):\n\nMr. President, so would you consider to put more sanctions on Russia? Because this discussion is going on now for weeks and months, and you tweeted\n\nDonald Trump (39:00):\n\nYeah, when I see…\n\nSpeaker 14 (39:00):\n\n… tweeted about it once, but then nothing happened. So, what would you do?\n\nDonald Trump (39:03):\n\nYeah. When I see the moment when we're not going to make a deal, when this thing won't stop-\n\nSpeaker 14 (39:07):\n\nIs there a deadline in that moment?\n\nDonald Trump (39:09):\n\n… at that moment… Yeah, it's in my brain, the deadline. When I see the moment where it's not going to stop, and I'm sure you're going to do the same thing, we'll be very, very tough. And it could be on both countries, to be honest, it takes two to tango, but we are going to be very tough, whether it's Russia or anybody else, we're going to be very tough. That's a bloodbath that's going on over there. And when I see the moment where I say, well, they're going to just keep fighting. I gave the analogy yesterday when I spoke to President Putin, I had a two-hour and fifteen-minute call with him, sometimes, and this is me speaking maybe in a negative sense, but sometimes you see two young children fighting like crazy. They hate each other and they're fighting in a park and you try and pull them apart, they don't want to be pulled. Sometimes you're better off letting them fight for a while and then pulling them apart.\n\n(40:09)And I gave that analogy to Putin yesterday. I said, \"President, maybe you're going to have to keep fighting and suffering a lot, because both sides are suffering, before you pull them apart before they're able to be pulled apart. But it's a pretty known analogy. You have two kids, they fight, fight, fight, sometimes you let them fight for a little while. You see it in hockey, you see it in sports. The referees let them go for a couple of seconds, let them go for a little while before you pull them apart. And maybe, and I said it, and maybe that's a negative because we're saying go, but a lot of bad blood, there's some bad blood between the two. I have to deal with it. And the Chancellor has to deal with it. It's incredible the level of, there's a great hatred between those two men, but between the warring parties. A great hatred.\n\nSpeaker 15 (41:03):\n\n[inaudible 00:41:04] you say and believe apparently that there is no immediate peace?\n\nDonald Trump (41:07):\n\nWhat?\n\nSpeaker 15 (41:07):\n\nThat there is no immediate peace that will [inaudible 00:41:10].\n\nDonald Trump (41:09):\n\nWell, I can't. I'd love to have immediate if I could, but we don't have immediate. I'd love to have that, I'd like it to start right now. We would leave a room if we knew the war could end, we'd say, forget about you guys. Forget about trade, right? We'd say, let's go settle it. There's some additional fighting that's going to go on. He attacked and they attacked pretty harshly, they went deep into Russia. And he actually told me, I mean I made it very clear, he said, \"We have no choice but to attack based on that, and it's probably not going to be pretty, I don't like it.\" I said, \"Don't do it. You shouldn't do it. You should stop it.\" But again, there's a lot of hatred. And I'm very proud of the fact that with India and Pakistan, I was able to stop that. And those are nuclear powers and that would have really… That was getting close to being out of hand. And I spoke to some very talented people on both sides, very good people on both sides, and I said, \"We're dealing with you on trade, Pakistan and India, right now.\" I said, \"We're not going to deal with you on trade if you're going to go shooting each other and whipping out nuclear weapons that maybe even affect us.\" Because you know that nuclear dust blows across oceans very quickly. It affects us. And I said, \"If you're going to do that, we're not going to do any trade deals.\" And you know what? I got that war stopped. Now I hope we don't go back and we find out that they started, but I don't think they will.\n\n(42:45)They were both good. They were well represented there. I want to congratulate both countries because as you know, the leader of India, who's a great guy, was here a few weeks ago. We had some great talks. We're doing a trade deal. And Pakistan, likewise, they have very strong leadership. Some people won't like when I say that, but it is what it is. And they stopped that war. Now, am I going to get credit? I'll never get credit for anything. They don't give me credit for anything. But nobody else could have done it. I stopped it. I was very proud of that.\n\n(43:22)I wish we could do the same thing with Ukraine and Russia. And at some point it'll happen. I believe that. And if it doesn't happen, or if I see somebody's out of line, if Russia's out of line, we'll be, you'll be amazed how tough. Remember this, they like to say that I'm friends with… I'm not friends with anybody. I'm friends with you. I'm not friends with any… I want the right thing to happen for our country, for everybody, for humanity.\n\n(43:51)But I'm the one that stopped the pipeline. It's called Nord Stream 2. Until I came along, nobody ever heard, not one person in this room, ever heard of Nord Stream 2. You probably did because it went to Germany. He's the only one-\n\nFriedrich Merz (44:03):\n\nKnowing that this was a mistake [inaudible 00:44:05].\n\nDonald Trump (44:04):\n\n… but I stopped it. I stopped it. Yeah. And you've said that openly it was a mistake because, and I used to go with Angela. I'd say, \"Well, wait a minute. We are spending all this money to defend you against Russia, and then you're giving Russia billions of dollars a month. What kind of a deal is that?\" Which was… But you said it better than anybody else. I appreciate it. But I'm the one that stopped it. And that was the biggest economic development job, if you want to call it that, in the history, think of it, in the history of Russia. That was a massive, it's the biggest pipeline in the world, going to go all over Europe, not only to Germany, they're in Germany, but then they were branching off all over to Europe. Nobody ever heard of, not one person of you, heard of it. And I stopped it. It was dead.\n\n(44:48)And then they say, I'm friends with Putin. I got along with him. He respected me, I respected him. It would've never happened. But I stopped Nord Stream 2. When Biden came in almost the first week, he approved it, he let it be built. And then they say that I wasn't tough on Russia. Putin said to me, \"You're not tough on Russia? You stopped the biggest, most important job we've ever done. You stopped it.\" And Biden came in and he let it be built. And I'll tell you what, I'll never forget the day I had it totally stopped. They weren't building. They gave up on it. They weren't able to. And then Biden came in and he let him build. I couldn't believe it. Okay. One or two questions more, please. Any questions? Any question for the Chancellor? [inaudible 00:45:33] Go ahead. For the Chancellor.\n\nSpeaker 16 (45:35):\n\n[inaudible 00:45:35] that would be one.\n\nDonald Trump (45:36):\n\nI like his answers much better.\n\nSpeaker 16 (45:39):\n\nWould you continue to support Ukraine?\n\nDonald Trump (45:42):\n\nYeah, I'm with Ukraine. We just signed a big deal on rare earth with Ukraine. And we You know what I'm for? Stopping killing, really. That's what I'm for. Again, a war that would've never started, should have never started, I want to see the killing stop. We spent $350 billion, much more than Europe, but Europe spent a lot also. And they spent way over a hundred billion.\n\nFriedrich Merz (46:07):\n\nYeah.\n\nDonald Trump (46:08):\n\nSo you're talking about close to $500 billion went into that whole thing. And it's not even the money. And I know with you too, it's a lot of money, but it's the death that's being caused. We went to the Middle East, I went last week to the Middle East, we took in $5.1 trillion. That's many, many times, it's 30, 40 times, 50 times more than what we're talking about. It's, think of that $5.1 trillion of investment with one trip that lasted four days. So it's not the money, it's a little the money, but not the money, the big thing. The big thing is the death. The death of…\n\n(46:48)And really the decimation. You've lost a whole culture. Ukraine had the most beautiful turrets, they call them turrets, little towers, beautiful towers, the most beautiful in the world. They're all now laying on their side blown to smithereens. It'll never happen again. They've taken away the culture of a country. They've taken away the heritage of a country. It's a terrible thing. But most importantly, again, is the death. Five thousand-plus people a week, soldiers, are being killed. He doesn't want that. And I don't want that. One more. Please. [inaudible 00:47:24]\n\nSpeaker 17 (47:24):\n\nMr. President, do you support the Graham Bill on putting high tariffs on China?\n\nDonald Trump (47:30):\n\nI haven't looked at it, but they'll be guided by me. That's the way it's supposed to be. They're going to be guided by me. No, I haven't looked at it. It's a bill on sanctions, et cetera. When it … I'm a very quick study, at the right time I'll do what I want to do, but it could very well be okay. I'll have to see. But they're waiting for me to decide on what to do. And I'll know maybe very soon. It is a harsh bill. Yeah, very harsh. Take one more. [inaudible 00:48:01].\n\nSpeaker 17 (48:02):\n\nI would like to have a question to the Chancellor as well, because… Do you agree with the analogy the president made on the war between Russia and Ukraine as being a fight between two kids? Is that how you feel that as well? And what do you actually want the US president to do in this?\n\nFriedrich Merz (48:19):\n\nWell, I think we both agree on this war and how terrible this war is going on. And we are both looking for ways to stop it very soon. And I told the president before we came in that he is the key person in the world who can really do that now by putting pressure on Russia. And we will have this debate later on again, how we can proceed jointly between the Europeans and the Americans.\n\n(48:53)And I think we are having the duty to do something on that now to stop it after three and a half years, which is really terrible. Look at the kids, the kids which were kidnapped from Ukraine to Russia. This is all terrible. And so we are talking about instruments, measures, what we can do. And my personal view is clear on that. We are on the side of Ukraine and we are trying to get them stronger and stronger just to make Putin stop this war. And this is our approach.\n\nDonald Trump (49:25):\n\nWe get satellite pictures of the war field and you don't even like to look at them, right?\n\nFriedrich Merz (49:31):\n\nIt's terrible. It's really terrible.\n\nDonald Trump (49:33):\n\nBodies, arms, heads, legs, all over the place. You've never seen anything like it. It's so ridiculous.\n\nFriedrich Merz (49:41):\n\nAnd this is only by Russian weapons against Ukraine. This had never happened with Ukraine weapons against Russia. Never. Ukraine is only targeting military targets. Not civilians, not private, not energy infrastructure. So this is the difference, and that's the reason why we are trying to do more on Russia, how to stop this war.\n\nDonald Trump (50:05):\n\nWell, in this case I'm talking about the battlefield, the soldiers on soldiers. But you could also say that too, with the cities.\n\nFriedrich Merz (50:11):\n\nYeah.\n\nDonald Trump (50:11):\n\nThe cities are being hit also. So it's a terrible, terrible thing. One, somebody said autopen? Did I hear the word autopen?\n\nSpeaker 18 (50:17):\n\nI'm just curious.\n\nDonald Trump (50:18):\n\nBecause I think it's the biggest scandal maybe in the last a hundred years in this country. So when I hear that word, I think it has to be discussed because the fake news will try and hide it and we can't do that. Go ahead.\n\nSpeaker 18 (50:32):\n\n[inaudible 00:50:32] asking, have you uncovered any evidence that anything specific was signed without President Biden's knowledge or by other people in the administration acting illegally?\n\nDonald Trump (50:41):\n\nWell, I don't think Biden would know whether or not he signed it.\n\nSpeaker 18 (50:43):\n\nI'm asking if you've uncovered any of that information?\n\nDonald Trump (50:45):\n\nNo, but I've uncovered the human mind. I was in a debate with the human mind and I didn't think he knew what the hell he was doing. So it's just one of those things, one of those problems. We can't ever allow that to happen to our country. The danger, our country was in. And I know some of the people that worked with him, radical-left horrible people.\n\n(51:05)And I could give you the name of some of the people that used the autopen because I'm here and I asked questions about people that were here, also. There are a lot of people that were here when that happened, and they're here right now and they'll answer your question very accurately. But I know some of the people that used that autopen, and those are not the people that had the same ideology as Joe Biden. These were radical-left lunatics that used that. And they didn't get elected. He didn't get elected either, actually.\n\n(51:33)Thank you very much, everybody. [inaudible 00:51:40].",

    "date": "",
    "transcript": "President Donald Trump (00:04):\n\n… fantastic job. He didn't need this. He didn't need it. And we find our government's a little nasty on occasion.\n\nElon Musk (00:12):\n\nYeah, at times.\n\nPresident Donald Trump (00:13):\n\nHello, Peter.\n\nPeter (00:13):\n\nHello, President Trump.\n\nPresident Donald Trump (00:14):\n\nGovernment's a little bit nasty. Peter, you haven't noticed that. You've had a charmed life, right?\n\nPeter (00:19):\n\nYou tell me.\n\nPresident Donald Trump (00:20):\n\nVery charmed. I think you've had a charmed life. I think what I'll do, if you don't mind, numbers have just come out which are rather extraordinary, and I thought I'd play a tape of one of the people who I've respected over the years, from Joe Kernan and Rick Santelli. This just came out and we'll just play that for a second.\n\nVideo (00:39):\n\nPersonal income is up 8/10 up of a percent. That is almost triple the expectations.\n\n(00:47)I'll tell you-\n\n(00:49)The income numbers, really for the first four months of the year, they're stellar. They're really stellar. I mean, I could go back and look at the first four months of many different years, really very strong numbers. And you're right, this administration is criticized for just about everything under the sun. I've never, ever, in my lifetime had glimpses into the politics of an administration in the form of transparency like this one. Why don't we give credit where credit is due, income really shooting up?\n\n(01:19)Rick, I also thought everybody was going to get one last order of imports that were going to be tariffed and they were loading up on things. How did the hell they already fix the trade? Or not fix it, but to cut it in half, that's crazy. So there wasn't a lot of front-loading of things that they needed before the tariffs hit?\n\n(01:42)Yeah, I'll tell you what, it really does call into question some of the conventional wisdoms. And it's going to be interesting to see what happens next month when we get this number or we see some of the other numbers, like current accounts, see how they fare. Because I don't know, I've been watching these numbers a long time, I don't think I've ever seen the trade deficit cut in half in one month.\n\nPresident Donald Trump (02:03):\n\nNot bad.\n\nElon Musk (02:03):\n\nWoo-hoo.\n\nPresident Donald Trump (02:07):\n\nNot bad.\n\nElon Musk (02:07):\n\nCome on, guys.\n\n(02:08)Yeah.\n\nPresident Donald Trump (02:08):\n\nI see Howard and Scott are here, so it's great. You guys want to stand over here, you might as well. You're the ones that helped produce those numbers. And it'll only get better. The tariffs are so important, and that's why we were so happy with the decision yesterday, where the tariffs continue. Because without the tariffs, our nation would be imperiled. We would really be imperiled. I think I can say that with great surety, Scott and Howard. And so we were very happy to get that decision, that big decision yesterday.\n\n(02:43)And today it's about a man named Elon, and he's one of the greatest business leaders and innovators the world has ever produced. He stepped forward to put his very great talents into the service of our nation and we appreciate it. And I just want to say that Elon has worked tirelessly helping lead the most sweeping and consequential government reform program in generations. And the kinds of things that he's found and his people have found, he's brought a group of very smart people in, and they found things that are pretty unbelievable. I have to say that the numbers that we're talking about are substantial, but they're going to be very much more substantial with time, because many of the things that we're working on right now, we're going to have to remember Elon as we find them, but the numbers could double and triple. Because many, many things, we don't want to go out with them until we're sure, but we've found things that are unbelievably stupid and unbelievably bad.\n\n(03:46)With the Department of Government Efficiency, Elon's delivered a colossal change in the old ways of doing business in Washington. DOGE has installed geniuses with an engineering mindset and unbelievably talented people in computers. I actually asked Elon one time, what's their primary thing? And they have a lot of primary things, all having to do with being smart, but he said the thing that they're really the best at is working with computers so that they can't be outsmarted by somebody that's not so honest that happens to also be good with computers, but not as good as these people. But the mindset and the senior ranks of every federal department, it's really changed. And with Elon's guidance, they're helping to detect fraud/waste and modernize broken and outdated systems. So as you know, we're talking about various systems and changing systems, and sadly, it takes a long time to do that. You'll change, let's say, a system at IRS and computerize it properly where a job could be done in 1/10 the time, but it takes sometimes years to rebuild those systems. But we've started, in many cases we've started.\n\n(04:56)I will say that this has less to do with Elon, but the air traffic control systems, we're bidding out to the best companies in the world. Those systems right now, the previous administration was horrible, what they did. They spent billions and billions of dollars, and in the end it didn't even come close to working. They tried to hook up wire to copper, and it can't be done. And they just spent billions of dollars and just wasted money, actually made the system much worse. So we're going to get a brand-new modern system. Congress is working with us on that and we're going to get it done as quickly as we can. But it's in the works, and once it's done, it'll be good for 30 years. But we have a system that's 48 years old and would have a modern computer hooked into a very outdated computer, and they don't hook up. I mean, they didn't hook up. So after spending billions of dollars, they turned on the system and in never any cases, from local to countrywide, they never worked.\n\n(05:59)More than 75,000 bureaucrats have voluntarily left their taxpayer-funded jobs to come out and really do the job. Countless, wasteful and unnecessary contracts have been terminated. And you know that we have terminated many, many contracts. And many contracts, Elon, are right now being looked at. And it may be six months, it may be almost a year in some cases. We're going through procedures. We're going through courts. And we'll remember you as we announce billions of dollars of extra waste, fraud, and abuse.\n\n(06:34)Just as an example, DOGE canceled $101 million for DEI contracts at the Department of Education. $101 million, and that was just a small section of the Department of Education. $59 million for illegal alien hotel rooms in New York City. And the landlord never made the kind of money that he made in the last short period of time. $59 million to a hotel in New York City. $45 million for diversity, equity, and inclusion scholarships in Burma. In Burma. Does anyone know about Burma? $42 million for social and behavioral change in Uganda. $40 million to improve the social and economic inclusion of sedentary migrants.\n\n(07:21)I can say it's $2 billion to Stacey Abrams and her environmental movement. There was a $100 in the account, and all of a sudden they found $2 billion in the account. And I assume that's being looked at. I don't know. I'm not sure, but I assume that's being looked at. Think of that, $2 billion. And then Lee will tell you there's another one over there for $20 billion being spent on another environmental… 20 billion. Not 20 million, a lot. Not 200,000, which is a lot. So think of it, in her case, you have $100, and now all of a sudden she gets hit with an infusion of $2 billion just before I take office.\n\n(08:05)$20 million for Arab Sesame Street in the Middle East. Nobody knows what that's all about. Nobody's been able to find it. $8 million for making mice transgender. So they spent $8 million on making mice transgender. And those are better than many of the others. I could sit here all day and read things just like that, but we have other things to do. So it's much, much more than just that.\n\n(08:32)We're totally committed to making the DOGE cuts permanent and stopping much more of the waste and the months that come. We want to get our great big beautiful bill finished and done. After that, we're going to be… We put some of this into the bill, but most of it's going to come later. We're going to have it cauterized by Congress, affirmed by Congress. In some cases we'll make cuts. In some cases we'll just use it in a different layer to save the money. But it's hundreds of billions of dollars.\n\n(09:04)DOGE has also fully modernized the federal retirement process and continues to work very hard on the IRS modernization. But we're taking that over with DOGE. Many of the DOGE people, Elon, are staying behind too, so they're not leaving.\n\nElon Musk (09:19):\n\nYeah, absolutely.\n\nPresident Donald Trump (09:19):\n\nAnd Elon's really not leaving. He's going to be back and forth, I think. I have a feeling. It's his baby, and I think he's going to be doing a lot of things. But Elon's service to America's been without comparison in modern history. He's already running one of the most innovative car companies in the world. You look at his factories and compare them with some of the old factories we have, and it's a big difference. And the most successful space company I guess in history, you would have to say. The largest free speech platform on the internet, et cetera. Yet Elon, with all of the success, he willingly accepted the outrageous abuse and slander and lies and attacks because he does love our country. I know that very much. He loves our country. Comes from another country, country that's going through trials and tribulations, I would say, but he's all about the USA. And Americans owe him a great debt of gratitude.\n\n(10:16)So I just want to thank Elon for his time as special government employee. Can you imagine? They called him an employee. But it's a special government employee. And for coming and helping us. And he really has changed the mindset of a lot of people. A lot of people thought maybe we'll cut 1% or 2% or 3%, then they said, \"Wow, we can cut a lot more than that.\" And we're going to do it very surgically. We're going to continue on the march. We're making America great again.\n\n(10:46)When I was in Saudi Arabia, we were in, as you know, three really great countries, predominantly the three. Qatar was great. UAE was great. Saudi Arabia, incredible. Such an incredible experience to be in those three countries. But the Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia, and I must tell you, the leaders, the great leaders of the other two that we just mentioned, they all said the same thing, that the United States is the hottest country right now anywhere in the world. And six months ago, we thought it was dead. It was like a dead country. And it would've been a dead country if we didn't have the right result on November 5th. It would've been a horrible, horrible situation was going on, with the borders, with transgender for everyone, men playing in women's sports, and so much more. But they were saying the hottest country anywhere in the world.\n\n(11:42)And then I played that little clip, because that was one person who was respected. But there were two people, because Joe was in that one too. Joe's a good man. But that was one group of people saying something about the success of what we've done over the last four months. They cannot believe it. In the one case they said they've never seen anything like it as long as they've been doing what they've been doing. They've been doing it for a long time.\n\n(12:06)So I just want to thank Elon for helping. And again, the United States right now is the hottest country anywhere in the world. There's no country as hot. And we're doing really well. When I left, we had no wars, we had no problems, we defeated ISIS, we rebuilt our military, and we had no inflation. And when I came back, we had a lot of inflation. We had wars all over the place. We had the embarrassment in Afghanistan, where we gave up billions and billions of dollars of military equipment. The most embarrassing moment in the history of our country, I believe. I believe that strongly. We have Russia with Ukraine. We had the attack in Israel in October. The horrible attack, October 7th. Horrible, horrible attack. Nobody's ever seen anything like it. And now we have something where we're really healing a lot of that.\n\n(13:03)We stopped India and Pakistan from fighting. I believe that could have turned into a nuclear disaster. And I want to thank the leaders of India, the leaders of Pakistan, and I want to thank my people also. We talked trade. And we said we can't trade with people that are shooting at each other and potentially using nuclear weapons. And they're great leaders in those countries. And they understood and they agreed, and that all stopped. And we're stopping others from fighting also. Because ultimately, we can fight better than anybody. We have the greatest military in the world. We have the greatest leaders in the world. We put one of them in charge of the Joint Chiefs of staff, as you know, General 'Razin' Caine. And we wiped out ISIS, completely wiped out ISIS in three weeks. They said it would take five years, and we did it in three weeks.\n\nPresident Donald Trump (14:00):\n\n… and that's the way it is. But we don't want to have to use our military. We want to be peace through strength when we can, and that's the way we're going to have it. So, I just want to thank Elon and all of his people. Most of those people are staying. Almost all of them are staying, and they're going to be with us. And you're going to see the results coming long into the future. Even a year and two years later, you're going to see a lot of the results. Those hundreds of billions of dollars are going to be adding up, and they're going to continue to add. It'll be really interesting to see what the final number is going to be. But again, Elon gave an incredible service. Nobody like him. And he had to go through the slings and the arrows, which is a shame because he's an incredible patriot. The good news is that 90% of the country knows that, and they appreciate it, and they really appreciate what he did. And I gave him a little special something we have here-\n\nElon Musk (14:52):\n\nThank you.\n\nPresident Donald Trump (14:54):\n\n… a very special… That I give to very special people. I have given it to some, but it goes to very special people, and I thought I'd give it to Elon as a-\n\nElon Musk (15:04):\n\nThank you.\n\nPresident Donald Trump (15:05):\n\n… presentation from our country.\n\nElon Musk (15:09):\n\nThank you.\n\nPresident Donald Trump (15:09):\n\nThank you, Elon.\n\nElon Musk (15:09):\n\nThank you. Thank you.\n\nPresident Donald Trump (15:09):\n\nTake care of yourself.\n\nElon Musk (15:10):\n\nThank you. You see the lock? The lock on this is amazing.\n\nPresident Donald Trump (15:15):\n\nThat's right. A large lock.\n\nElon Musk (15:21):\n\nWell, let me say perhaps a few words, that this is not the end of DOGE, but really the beginning. My time as a special government employee necessarily had to end. It was a limited time thing. It's 134 days, I believe, which ends in a few days. So, it comes with a time limit. But the DOGE team will only grow stronger over time. The DOGE influence will only grow stronger. I liken to Buddhism. It's like like a way of life. So, it is permeating throughout the government, and I'm confident that, over time, we'll see a trillion dollars of savings and reduction, a trillion dollars of waste and fraud reduction.\n\n(16:02)The calculations of the DOGE team thus far, in terms of an FY25 to FY26 delta, are over 160 billion, and that's climbing. We expect that number will probably go over 200 billion soon. So, I think the DOGE team is doing an incredible job. They're going to continue doing an incredible job, and I'll continue to be visiting here and be a friend and advisor to the president. And I look forward to, at times, being back in this amazing room. By the way, isn't this incredible? Look. I mean, it's stunning, I think, how the president has just completely redone the Oval Office. It's beautiful. I love the gold on the ceiling.\n\nPresident Donald Trump (16:48):\n\nThank you. It's pretty nice.\n\nElon Musk (16:50):\n\nYeah. So-\n\nPresident Donald Trump (16:52):\n\nThat's been there a long time. That was plaster. Nobody ever really saw it. They didn't know the eagle was up there, and we highlighted. Essentially, it's a landmark, a great landmark. That's 24 karat gold, and everybody loved it, and now they all see it when they come in. So, it's been good.\n\nElon Musk (17:09):\n\nYeah. The Oval Office finally has the majesty that it deserves thanks to the president. So, I look forward to continuing to be a friend and advisor to the president, continuing to support the DOGE team. And we are relentlessly pursuing $8 trillion in waste and fraud reductions which will benefit the American taxpayer. So that's it, really. Thank you, Mr. President.\n\nPresident Donald Trump (17:38):\n\nThank you. Great job. Thank you. Peter?\n\nPeter Doocy (17:44):\n\nThank you, President Trump. The president mentioned that you had to deal with all the slings and arrows during your time at DOGE. There's this New York-\n\nElon Musk (17:51):\n\nA lot of the people, some of the media organizations, in this room were the slingers.\n\nPeter Doocy (17:54):\n\nWell, so there is a New York Times report today that accuses you of blurring the line between-\n\nElon Musk (18:00):\n\nOh, wait. Wait. Wait. New York Times, is that the same publication that got a Pulitzer Prize for false reporting on the Russiagate? Is it the same organization?\n\nPeter Doocy (18:11):\n\nI got to check my Pulitzer counter.\n\nElon Musk (18:13):\n\nI think it is. I think it is.\n\nPeter Doocy (18:16):\n\nSo-\n\nElon Musk (18:16):\n\nI think the judge just ruled against New York Times for their lies about the Russiagate hoax and that they might have to give back that Pulitzer Prize. That New York Times? Let's move on.\n\nPeter Doocy (18:27):\n\nOkay, then. President Trump, I got-\n\nElon Musk (18:28):\n\nNext question.\n\nSpeaker 1 (18:28):\n\nThat's right. Come on. [inaudible 00:18:29]-\n\nPeter Doocy (18:29):\n\n… one. I got a question for Trump. So, President Trump, Biden aides who used to work here are in talks with Republicans in Congress to go and testify about what they did or didn't do to possibly conceal President Biden's decline. Do you think that Dr. Jill Biden should also have to come in and testify about what she did or didn't do?\n\nPresident Donald Trump (18:54):\n\nWell, I hate the concept of it. It's the wife of a man who was going through a lot of problems, and everybody that dealt with him understood that. And I guess it came out during the debate loud and clear. That was the biggest signal of all. They have to do what's right. There was a lot of dishonesty in the election, as you know, of 2020. That's been now caught. People understand it. It was a rigged election. And when you go further out, when you see the autopen, I mean, I think the autopen is going to become one of the great scandals of all time because you have somebody operating it, or a number of people operating. Because I knew Joe Biden. Joe Biden wasn't in favor of opening up borders, bringing 21 million people into this from prisons and mental institutions and gang members. He wasn't into that at all. And who signed these orders, proclamations, and all of the different things that he signed that set our country so far back, that was so bad for our country?\n\nPeter Doocy (19:55):\n\nWith the autopen, how would it work? We're in the Oval Office right now. If there was a group of rogue staffers that worked for you who wanted to advance a bill or an executive order without your knowledge, how could they do it? How did they go behind the president's back?\n\nPresident Donald Trump (20:10):\n\nWell, it's very hard, because I'd read your newspapers or your media the next day, and I'd say, \"Well, I didn't approve that.\" And I would find it. I mean, they wouldn't get away with it for long because I'd say, \"I never signed that. Who the hell signed that?\" Autopens, to me, are used to sign letters to people… Because we get, I think they said, 20,000 letters a week. And you like to be able… When somebody takes the time to write a letter, it's nice to write back. And autopens are meant for that. Autopens are not meant to sign major proclamations or tax cuts or borders, anything having to do with the border, which is so important. And if it happened on my watch, I would be able to see it, because the next day or sooner, I'd be reading about something that I knew nothing about and, \"Who the hell signed this?\"\n\n(20:56)So, I almost never used the autopen. In fact, yesterday I was signing about 81, I think it was 81, proclamations and statements to people that I think should be signed by us. I think when you write letters to foreign dignitaries or presidents or prime ministers, you should be signing those letters. Not done with Autopens. I understand he signed almost everything with an autopen. It's a very dangerous thing. It really means you're not president. Whoever operated the autopen, and we think we know who that is, and it was actually more than one person, but that's not what the presidency is all about. I hardly used an autopen.\n\nSpeaker 1 (21:37):\n\nOn trade, sorry-\n\nSpeaker 2 (21:37):\n\nMr. President. Mr. President, on China-\n\nSpeaker 1 (21:40):\n\n… are you going to reinstate the tariffs on China? You said that they violated the agreement with the U.S.\n\nPresident Donald Trump (21:44):\n\nWell, they did. They violated a big part of the agreement we made. If you read that whole statement, I was very nice to them. I helped them because they were in trouble with the stoppage of a massive amount of business. But I'm sure that I'll speak to President Xi, and hopefully, we'll work that out. But yeah-\n\nSpeaker 1 (22:02):\n\nIs it on the table?\n\nPresident Donald Trump (22:03):\n\n… it's a violation of the agreement. Yeah, please?\n\nSpeaker 1 (22:04):\n\nMr. Musk-\n\nSpeaker 3 (22:04):\n\nMr. President, can you give us an update to the latest ceasefire agreement that Israel has agreed to, but Hamas is still considering?\n\nPresident Donald Trump (22:12):\n\nWell, they're very close to an agreement on Gaza, and we'll let you know about it during the day or maybe tomorrow. And we have a chance of that. And I think we have a chance of making a deal with Iran also. They don't want to be blown up. They would rather make a deal. And I think that could happen in the not-too-distant future. That'd be a great thing. If we could have a deal without bombs being dropped all over the Middle East, that would be a very good thing. They can't have a nuclear weapon.\n\nSpeaker 1 (22:36):\n\n[inaudible 00:22:37]-\n\nSpeaker 4 (22:36):\n\n[inaudible 00:22:37]-\n\nPresident Donald Trump (22:39):\n\nWe want them to be safe. We want them to have a very, very successful nation. Let it be a great nation, but they cannot have a nuclear weapon. It's very simple. And I think we're fairly close to a deal with Iran.\n\nSpeaker 4 (22:50):\n\n[inaudible 00:22:52]-\n\nSpeaker 1 (22:52):\n\nMr. Musk, a question for Elon.\n\nPresident Donald Trump (22:53):\n\nYeah, please.\n\nSpeaker 1 (22:54):\n\nYou said just now that you look forward to being a friend and advisor to the president.\n\nElon Musk (22:57):\n\nOh, I am.\n\nSpeaker 1 (22:58):\n\nSo, do you expect to continue advising-\n\nElon Musk (23:01):\n\nI [inaudible 00:23:02]-\n\nSpeaker 1 (23:01):\n\n… the president and DOGE informally, or are you going to sort of shift your focus entirely to your companies?\n\nElon Musk (23:09):\n\nWell, I expect to continue to provide advice whenever the president would like advice, if he-\n\nPresident Donald Trump (23:15):\n\nI hope so.\n\nElon Musk (23:15):\n\nI mean, yeah, I expect to remain a friend and an advisor. And certainly, if there's anything the president wants me to do, I'm at the president's service.\n\nSpeaker 5 (23:26):\n\nMr. Musk, Mr. Elon-\n\nSpeaker 6 (23:26):\n\nMr. Musk. Mr. Musk, [inaudible 00:23:27]-\n\nSpeaker 7 (23:26):\n\nMr. Musk, on DOGE, you said that there was a trillion-dollar promise for cuts from-\n\nElon Musk (23:32):\n\nYes. I think we do expect over time to achieve the trillion dollars.\n\nSpeaker 7 (23:35):\n\nBut what have you found, in your time here, was the biggest roadblock to getting those cuts? Was it the Cabinet, or was it Congress, or something else? What was the biggest roadblock from your work?\n\nElon Musk (23:46):\n\nIt's mostly just a lot of hard work. It's really not any one person or Congress. It's going through, really, millions of line items and saying, \"Does each one of them makes sense or does it not make sense?\" Obviously, at times, when you cut expenses, those who are receiving the money, whether they were receiving that money legitimately or not, they do complain. And you're not going to hear someone confessing that they received money inappropriately. Never. They're going to always say that they received money appropriately for an important cause. Naturally, that's what you'd expect. It's just a lot of work going through the vast expenses of the federal government and just really asking questions, \"What's this money for? Are you sure it's actually being used well?\" Many times we can't even find anyone who defends it.\n\n(24:41)So, for a lot of the expenses, there is actually no defender at all. And then we have to just work through the process of stopping the spending where there's often literally no defender. Nobody even knows why the money's being spent. It's truly absurd. I mean, we find situations where there are millions of software licenses with zero people using them. Zero. Exactly. This is the quizzical expression. You're like, \"Surely, if there's millions of software licenses, someone should be using them.\" No. And then we've got to go through the process of saying, \"Okay, look, if no one's using the software, we need to terminate this software license agreement.\"\n\nSpeaker 8 (25:16):\n\nMr. Musk-\n\nSpeaker 9 (25:18):\n\nMr. Musk-\n\nElon Musk (25:18):\n\nThat's everywhere in the government, by the way.\n\nSpeaker 8 (25:21):\n\nMr. Musk, what do you think would be easier, colonizing Mars or making the government efficient?\n\nElon Musk (25:27):\n\nIt's a tough call, but I think colonizing Mars and making life multi-planetary is harder. And as I said, we do expect to achieve over time the trillion dollars of savings. We can't do it in a few months, but if you say by the… I think the official end of DOGE, which the president may choose to extend, is the middle of next year. If you say by the middle of next year, with the support of the president and Congress, could we achieve $20 of savings? I think so. We're on track to do so.\n\nSpeaker 8 (25:56):\n\nDo you faith that Congress has-\n\nSpeaker 10 (25:56):\n\nElon, Elon, [inaudible 00:25:59]-\n\nPresident Donald Trump (25:56):\n\nGo ahead.\n\nSpeaker 11 (26:01):\n\nMr. President, you had mentioned earlier in the week that DOGE had become a whipping boy. And as the president mentioned, you went through a lot to go through this process.\n\nElon Musk (26:09):\n\nYes.\n\nSpeaker 11 (26:10):\n\nWas it worth it for you? And what would you change?\n\nElon Musk (26:14):\n\nYeah. So, what we found was happening was that if there were any cuts anywhere, then people would assume that was done by DOGE. And so we became like, essentially, the DOGE boogie man, where any cut anywhere would be ascribed to DOGE. A friend of mine's daughter who's at law school at Georgetown thought that DOGE had cut the internships, the legal internships for the Senate, and we have nothing to do with that. So, if they have been cut, it was not to do with us, just as an example. So, it just became a bit ridiculous where anything, any cut anywhere, was somehow DOGE, including things that made no sense and we would agree made no sense.\n\n(27:02)So, there are many things that occur in the government because it's the banal evil of bureaucracy. It's the, frankly, largely uncaring nature of bureaucracy. As the great Milton Friedman said, money is spent most poorly when it is somewhat else's money being spent on people you don't know. And that's how federal spending is. And then you can't really even blame the individuals, because the way the government works is complaint minimization. So, when someone within the government tries to stop money being spent, there's usually someone that complains. And then their manager will say, \"It's not worth the trouble. Just pay it anyway.\" That happens over and over again.\n\nSpeaker 11 (27:56):\n\nSo, was it worth it for you?\n\nPresident Donald Trump (27:56):\n\nPeter?\n\nSpeaker 12 (27:56):\n\n[inaudible 00:27:57]-\n\nSpeaker 13 (27:56):\n\nElon-\n\nPresident Donald Trump (27:56):\n\nHold on. Yeah.\n\nElon Musk (27:56):\n\nI think it was an important thing. I think it was a necessary thing, and I think it will have a good effect in the future.\n\nPeter Doocy (00:00):\n\nPeter Doocy (28:00):\n\nThank you, President Trump. This week there was a video on board a plane that showed the First Lady of France slapping her husband, Emmanuel Macron. Do you have any world leader to world leader marital advice [inaudible 00:28:13] Macron?\n\nPresident Donald Trump (28:17):\n\nMake sure the door remains closed. That was not good. That was not good. No, I spoke to him and he's fine. They're fine. They're two really good people. I know them very well. And I don't know what that was all about, but I know them very well and they're fine.\n\nElon Musk (28:37):\n\nI got a little shiner here.\n\nPeter Doocy (28:39):\n\nWhat do you think about the Democratic Party plan to avoid being swept in every battleground state again by spending $20 million to study how to speak to American men?\n\nPresident Donald Trump (28:51):\n\nWell, they spent 2.8 billion. We spent 1.5. We spent much less. We spent about half of what they spent, and at the end they were $28 million short. They spent 2.8 billion. That's a lot. But they couldn't get 28 million at the end. And now they want to spend, I read that, they want to spend money to learn how to talk. That's fake. You don't want to be fake. You shouldn't have to hire consultants to say what America needs because then they should be, the consultant should be running the deal, not them.\n\n(29:25)But I read that, they want to spend a lot of money in each state. So we won all seven swing states, seven out of seven. We won a lot more than that. We won the popular vote. We won everything. And they want to spend money to find out what they did wrong. And I mean, I could tell you what they did wrong. I could tell you every one of their programs. When they say men playing in women's sports, I would say that's not a winner. When they say transgender for everybody, I think that's not a winner. When they say open borders so the entire world population of criminals can pour into our country, I don't think that's a winner. I mean, I just gave them that for free, but I don't know if they'll change their ways.\n\n(30:03)I see them all the time. I see people that I know in Congress, Democrats, they're trying to justify some of the things I just said. You can't justify them. I always hear they're 80/20 issues. I say they're not 80/20, they're 97/3. They might be 99 to 1. They're not 80/20. They wish they were 80/20. And they're wasting a lot of money if they're going to continue with that nonsense.\n\nSpeaker 14 (30:27):\n\nMr. President, on the big…\n\nPeter Doocy (30:29):\n\nThis is a little bit more of a Page Six question, but back when you hosted The Apprentice, you mentioned once in 2012 that Diddy was a good friend of yours back then. He has since found himself in some very serious legal trouble.\n\nPresident Donald Trump (30:39):\n\nYeah, that's true.\n\nPeter Doocy (30:40):\n\nWould you ever consider pardoning him?\n\nPresident Donald Trump (30:44):\n\nWell, nobody's asked. You had to be the one to ask Peter, but nobody's asked. But I know people are thinking about it. I know they're thinking about it. I think some people have been very close to asking.\n\n(30:54)First of all, I'd look at what's happening and I haven't been watching it too closely, although it's certainly getting a lot of coverage. I haven't seen him. I haven't spoken to him in years. He used to really like me a lot. But I think when I ran for politics, that relationship busted up from what I read. He didn't tell me that. But I'd read some little bit nasty statements in the paper all of a sudden.\n\n(31:20)It's different. You become a much different person when you run for politics and you do what's right. I could do other things and I'm sure he'd like me, and I'm sure other people would like me, but it wouldn't be as good for our country. As we said, our country's doing really well because of what we're doing. So I can't. It's not a popularity contest. No, I don't know. I would certainly look at the facts. If I think somebody was mistreated, whether they like me or don't like me, it wouldn't have any impact on me.\n\nSpeaker 15 (31:49):\n\nMr. President, on the big, beautiful bill, on the big, beautiful bill, would you like to see the Senate build in some support for your tariffs on the big, beautiful bill or should that be a standalone bill?\n\nPresident Donald Trump (31:56):\n\nI have great support on the tariffs. I mean, I was so honored that we got that ridiculous stay lifted because that would've taken away presidential power. It would've taken away everything that was granted by the founders. It would've been a terrible thing and it would've, most importantly, it would've left us vulnerable. We have a lot of countries that use tariffs on us and use them viciously actually, viciously. And if we didn't have the power to use tariffs on them and instantly, not when you go back to Congress and try and get hundreds of people to agree on something that would take months to get just one simple proclamation, if we didn't have the power to counteract their powers, you wouldn't have a country left. We have to act fast. We have to be fast and nimble as they say.\n\n(32:41)And that was a really great moment, I think yesterday when that stay was lifted, and hopefully now we'll go to court and just win that battle because if we don't have the power to do what they're doing to us, we are going to be a great nation no longer.\n\nSpeaker 16 (32:58):\n\nQuickly, Mr. President. Elon Musk was once idolized by folks on the left in this country before joining your administration.\n\nPresident Donald Trump (33:04):\n\nThat's true.\n\nSpeaker 16 (33:04):\n\nNow he's considered a hero by conservatives. Why do you think this man, what he's done in American life has been so politicized? Does it [inaudible 00:33:12]\n\nPresident Donald Trump (33:11):\n\nWell, his life has been amazing. I mean, I look at so many different things. I look at that rocket being guided back into position. I've never seen that before. I thought it was a space movie, thought it was a movie. You look at what he's done in terms of communication, it's been unbelievable. So many different. Even tunnels going underground, not having to go through all the process of going. He's got a company that does that. He's got so many different companies.\n\n(33:38)Starlink, as an example. He saved a lot of lives, probably hundreds of lives in North Carolina. I don't even know if you remember, but I called you. They needed Starlink in North Carolina, and I didn't know what the hell Starlink was. I said, \"What is it? Who owns it?\" He said, \"Do you know Elon Musk?\" I said, \"Yeah, I happen to know the gentleman.\" This was before his government stay. And they said, \"We really need it.\" Because North Carolina was literally, became an island. People had no communication, they had no access to anything and they were dying.\n\n(34:11)And I called up Elon and you can't get it because it's so successful. It's very hard to get. And he had so much of it brought over there and they told me it was unbelievable. It saved a lot of lives. So he's just done a lot of things. I don't think, frankly I don't think he gets credit for what he's done. And he's a very good person too. You know what? If he wasn't a good person, if he wasn't, but he did the same things, I'd probably maybe speak differently. He happens to be a really good person who loves the country.\n\nSpeaker 7 (34:40):\n\nOn the one, big beautiful bill, you had indicated this week that there were some things you didn't like about what had passed in the House. What changes do you want to see the Senate make? And you had also indicated there were things you didn't like about the bill. What would you be suggesting he pushed senators to change in their version?\n\nPresident Donald Trump (34:57):\n\nWell, I'll tell you. I'll go first. It's an unbelievable bill. It cuts your deficits. It's a huge cutting. But there's things I'd like to see maybe cut a little bit more. I'd like to see a bigger cut in taxes. It's going to be the largest tax decrease or cut in the history of our country. I'd like to see it get down to an even lower number. I was shooting for a slightly lower number. I would've liked to have done that.\n\n(35:24)But with all of that being said, when you look at the tax cut and the fact that the original tax cut, which made us so… We had the most successful four years in the history of our country, the economy, and this is going to be even better. And you see that by the reports that came out just yesterday or tonight, I guess they were released this morning at eight o'clock. You see the kind of numbers where somebody that's a pro is like, \"Whoa, I haven't seen numbers like this since I've been doing this.\" These are human emotions of professionals that have never seen numbers like. And we've just started.\n\n(35:58)The bill is a great bill. It's going to be jiggered around a little bit. It's going to be negotiated with the Senate, with the House. But the end result is it extends the Trump tax cuts. If it doesn't get approved, you'll have a 68% tax increase. You're going to go up 68%. That's a number that nobody's ever heard of before. You'll have a massive tax increase. If it does get approved, you'll have a large tax cut, the largest we've ever had when you add the past tax cuts that we got you, they call them the Trump tax cuts.\n\n(36:39)It's an amazing bill. It does amazing things. With all of that, it's going to be adjusted a little bit over the next coming weeks. And I think it's going to be passed. The Republicans want to pass it. With all of the great things it does, including an extension of debt, the extension. We have to extend the debt. If we don't extend debt, we're in default.\n\n(36:58)Now, the Democrats might like our country to be in default, but in 250 years we've never been in default. That was handed to them by a very well-meaning man that gave it to them because he thought it was the right thing to do. It could have been their problem before the election. But this man thought it was the right thing to do, and he was well-meaning. I don't hold anything against him for that. But that was put on our plate when it should have been on the Democrats. September 28th, a famous date. It should have been taken care of by the Democrats, but this person, a man of power, gave it to us so that in June that comes due. Well, we have to take care of that because if we don't take care of it, we have a country in default and we don't ever want to have a country in default.\n\n(37:46)I'll tell you, a certain senator, Elizabeth Warren, said that she would never, ever allow a default on our debt. She would never let it happen. And she would like to get rid of the debt ceiling, what's called the debt ceiling. I call it the debt extension because we really need an extension. That she'd like to see that gotten rid of. And there are many people that agree, many Democrats agree with that.\n\n(38:13)But we gave that through, and I don't want to say an error, he did it well-meaning, they gave that to us. It was a Democrat problem just before the election, would've had a huge impact on the election and to our benefit. We won anyway, but to our benefit. But felt that really for the good of the country we should extend that. But Elizabeth Warren and various other people would like to see that… Her whole career, she wanted to see it terminated, gotten rid of, not being voted on every five years or 10 years. And the reason was because it's so catastrophic for our country. And I always agreed with her. That was one thing I agreed with her on.\n\n(38:56)Now, I haven't spoken to her, but I would say that if you asked her that question now, she'd say, \"No, no, it's their problem.\" But it's a very unfortunate situation. It's a very unfair situation. And she happened to be right on that. It should be gotten rid of, or it should simply be extended. But that's one of the things that gets taken care of in this bill, that automatically gets extended for a four-year period. And it should be. But I agree with Elizabeth Warren on that. I think you should get rid of it. It's too catastrophic.\n\n(39:24)Yeah, please. Go ahead.\n\nSpeaker 17 (39:27):\n\nWhat changes do you want to see, Mr. Musk, for the bill?\n\nSpeaker 18 (39:27):\n\nWhat message [inaudible 00:39:28] international students, I guess you're welcomed to study in the United States. And one question for Mr. Musk.\n\nPresident Donald Trump (39:38):\n\nTo students. Well, we want to have great students here. We just don't want students that are causing trouble. We want to have students. I want to have foreign students. I think Harvard, it's close to 31%. That's a lot. Our country's given $5 billion plus to Harvard over a short period of time. Nobody knew that. We found that out. I wouldn't say that was a DOGE thing, but we found that out over a period of time. That was sort of a Trump thing. We ended up in litigation for other reasons because they're very anti-Semitic. And in finding out and in going through the books, we found out that the country gave them $5 million plus, much more than that actually. And we're having it out with them. And let's see what happens. I think we have a very good… Well, it's a very sad case. It's a case we win. We can't lose that case. Because we have the right to make grants. We're not going to make any grants like that. But I don't think Harvard's been acting very nicely.\n\n(40:33)I think Colombia wants to get to the bottom of the problem. They've acted very well. And there are other institutions too, they're acting. But Harvard's trying to be a big shot. And all that happens is every three days we find another $100 million that was given. Two days ago, we found $200 million more. The money's given to them like gravy. I'd like to see the money go to trade schools where people learn how to fix motors and engines, where people learn how to build rocket ships because somebody has to build those rocket ships.\n\n(41:04)And I'd like to see trade schools set up. Because you could take 5 billion plus hundreds of billions more, which is what's spent, and you could have the greatest trade school system anywhere in the world. And that's what we need to build his rockets and robots and things that he's doing and to build lots of other things.\n\n(41:22)And I went to school with people, in some cases they weren't good students, but they could fix the engine of a car better than anybody I've ever seen. They could take it apart blindfolded. They had an ability at that. And they did very well. They made a lot of money. It's a very skilled job. It's great. But I'd like to see a lot of money going into trade schools. I've always felt that. And we probably found our pot of gold, and that's what's been wasted at places like Harvard and the money's been wasted. Yeah, please.\n\nSpeaker 19 (41:51):\n\nI wanted to ask quickly, Mr. Musk. Is your eye okay? What happened to your eye [inaudible 00:41:55]?\n\nElon Musk (41:57):\n\nWell, I wasn't anywhere near France.\n\nElon Musk (42:01):\n\nBut-\n\nPresident Donald Trump (42:01):\n\nI didn't notice [inaudible 00:42:07].\n\nElon Musk (42:01):\n\nJust making a joke about the [inaudible 00:42:09].\n\nPresident Donald Trump (42:09):\n\nI didn't notice.\n\nElon Musk (42:10):\n\nSo yeah, I was just horsing around with little X and I said, go ahead, punch me in the face. And he did. Turns out even a five-year-old punching you in the face, actually does-\n\nPresident Donald Trump (42:19):\n\nThat was X that did that?\n\nElon Musk (42:20):\n\nYeah.\n\nPresident Donald Trump (42:21):\n\nX could do it if you knew X, he could do it.\n\nElon Musk (42:23):\n\nHe's with with his mom right now. But I didn't really feel much at the time. And then I guess it bruises up, but I was just horsing around with the kids, basically.\n\nPresident Donald Trump (42:31):\n\nI didn't notice it, actually.\n\nPeter Doocy (42:34):\n\n[inaudible 00:42:34] I know that you tried to stay pretty neutral because not your war, but-\n\nPresident Donald Trump (42:39):\n\nBy the way, not my war. I just want to solve the problem for people. This was not a war that was going to happen if I were president.\n\nPeter Doocy (42:45):\n\nRight. And so not your war, but as you try to fix it and as you survey this hellscape of the Ukrainian front lines.\n\nPresident Donald Trump (42:53):\n\nIt's horrible.\n\nPeter Doocy (42:54):\n\nAnd you guys, you and your team deal with a very stubborn Vladimir Putin.\n\nPresident Donald Trump (42:56):\n\nAnd Zelensky.\n\nPeter Doocy (42:56):\n\nBut do you look at this conflict-\n\nPresident Donald Trump (42:56):\n\nVery stubborn Zelensky too.\n\nElon Musk (43:02):\n\nTrue.\n\nPeter Doocy (43:02):\n\n… any differently now? Do you look at this and see Putin as the good guy or the bad guy?\n\nPresident Donald Trump (43:08):\n\nSo I've known him very well and I went through a lot of things with him because Russia, the Russia, Russia, Russia hoax, turned out to be a total hoax. New York Times, they got a Pulitzer Prize, they have to give back the Pulitzer Prize. That's my lawsuit, and they're doing very poorly in that lawsuit. They wrote stories about how it was true and it was false, and a lot of Washington Post also.\n\n(43:35)I have gotten to see things that I was very surprised at, rockets being shot into cities like Kiev during a negotiation that I felt was maybe very close to ending. We were going to solve a problem and then all of a sudden rockets got shot into a couple of cities and people died. I saw things that I was surprised at and I don't like being surprised. So I'm very disappointed in that way. With that being said, I'd like to see it end. 5,000 people, I think the numbers even more than that, but 5,000 people a week are being killed. Mostly soldiers, but also people that live in little cities and towns throughout Ukraine, and I'd like to see that stop.\n\nPeter Doocy (44:24):\n\nI asked Karoline this yesterday, but I want to ask you directly. So many of the things that you're trying to do are held up in court right now. If the courts are going to have so much influence over US policy, do you wish you would've just become a judge?\n\nPresident Donald Trump (44:40):\n\nYeah, well look, it wasn't meant to be that way. If you look at the founders, the president had certain powers and you have your three groups, and they all had supposed to be equal, pretty equal powers. But you can't have a judge in Boston running foreign policy in places all over the country because he is got a liberal bent or he's a radical left person. That's what the executive branch is for, and you have checks and balances.\n\n(45:09)But we had millions of people pour into our country, many, many criminals poured into our country, murderers. Mental institutions from all over the world being emptied out into our country, and if we don't get them out and get them out quickly, we're going to, you could lose your country very easily. This is a bad that anybody would allow this to happen to our country. With all of the things we took over inflation, we took over some wars, we took over a lot of problems that didn't exist when I was president. None of it existed. We wiped out ISIS. Other than that, we had no wars.\n\n(45:41)Putin was never going to hit Ukraine. Israel would've never been attacked. That attack, as you know, Iran had no money. They didn't have money for Hamas, they didn't have money for Hezbollah. They had no money whatsoever. That wasn't going to happen. All of these things that happened weren't going to happen. You wouldn't have had inflation. So it's very sad when I came back. But the thing that is the hardest is that they allowed 21 million people into our country. And many of those people are stone-cold criminals. They moved their criminal population into the United States, and of all the things that are bad, I solved inflation, I believe already, I got the fuel prices down, the fuel prices came down. That's one of the reasons, they screwed up the energy, they screwed up the cost of gasoline and oil and gas and you had tremendous inflation, the greatest inflation probably in the history of our country under Biden.\n\n(46:44)And when people said, oh, but the economies are… No, the economy was terrible for the people because they couldn't afford the energy and the energy brought everything else up. Energy is the big deal. But with all of that, we solved that already in four months. We solved it. A $1.99, a $1.98, gasoline, first time people have seen that in a long time, since my term. But the hardest thing to solve is millions of people pouring into our country, many of whom are criminals. Because remember, these countries are smart. Their leaders are very street smart. They're sending the people that they don't want. They don't want the people that are there, that are law-abiding, that are productive, that are working hard, they want people that are in jails. We have them. They allow them to come in.\n\n(47:31)And I always look to the other side, why would somebody do something? In business, I'd try and study, why would they want to do this? Why would they want to sell it? Why would they want to buy it? One thing I can't figure out is what would an administration, what were they thinking when they allowed millions of people from prisons all over the world, not just from South America, Venezuela, all over the world from the Congo in Africa, hundreds of people, thousands of people from the Congo, rough, rough prisoners from Asia, from Europe, rough parts of Europe. Why would they allow them to come into our country? Why would they do that? It's the one thing I can't figure out. And I don't believe it was Joe Biden. I really don't. I mean, look, he's been a sort of a moderate person over his lifetime. Not a smart person, but somewhat vicious person, I will say. If you feel sorry for him, don't feel so sorry because he is vicious.\n\n(48:34)What he did with his political opponent and all of the people that he hurt, he hurt a lot of people, Biden, and so I really don't feel sorry for him. But he wasn't a person that would allow murderers to come into our country. He wasn't a person that was in favor of transgender for anybody that wanted it, take kids out of families, et cetera, et cetera. So I just don't understand why a thing like this, how a thing like this, could have been allowed to happen. Very sad. [inaudible 00:49:03]. It's very, very sad for our country.\n\nSpeaker 20 (49:06):\n\nPresident Trump [inaudible 00:49:08].\n\nElon Musk (49:07):\n\nIf I can add something to that? I think the fundamental moral flaw of the left is empathy for the criminals and not empathy for the victims. Empathy for the criminals, but not empathy for the victims. And there's been way too much of that, that needs to stop. To the President's point, there's been immense judicial overreach that is unconstitutional, that was never intended. And it's undermining the people's faith in the legal system. It needs to stop. It's gone too far.\n\nPresident Donald Trump (49:42):\n\n[inaudible 00:49:42]. And just today, just a couple of hours ago, we had a great decision from the Supreme Court, thank goodness, that was very important. We had two important decisions yesterday on the tariffs because again, we have to be able to fight a fair fight with other countries. Howard, would you say we have to be able to use tariffs to fight people that use tariffs on us? I mean, if we didn't have that power of tariffs, we would economically be destroyed as a country because they will destroy us, other countries will destroy us with unchecked tariffs. We can check them when we have the years, they tried to take that power away from us and if you take that power away, we're not going to have a country, we won't have an economically viable country.\n\n(50:26)But it's very important on immigration that we be able to get people out without having to go through a long court case. I mean, it was up to some of these judges, every single one of these millions of people, millions of people, criminals, prisoners that were let go from jails because they save a fortune when they did, they brought them into the United States. You know what they're saving the money they're saving? But some of the murders, it's very important that we're able to get those people out of here fast, bring them back to their country where they belong, and those countries take them because if they don't take them, they have to go through the wrath of the United States and they take them. But we have judges that don't want that to happen.\n\n(51:08)And it's a terrible thing that's going through the court system right now, that whole situation, but when ICE and with border patrol, they've done an incredible job, when they do this incredible job and they capture 100 killers and drug dealers, we can't keep them for years here as we go through trials, we have to get them out rapidly. And we know who they are. We know who they are, and we're very careful about who they are. But we have to get them out rapidly or again, we're not going to have a country. Okay. [inaudible 00:51:47]. Maybe one or two more. Go ahead, please.\n\nSpeaker 21 (51:48):\n\nMr. President [inaudible 00:51:50] tariffs may also affect companies like Tesla, which has cars manufactured abroad, and this is also to Elon's cost.\n\nPresident Donald Trump (51:57):\n\nWell, he's going to end up building his whole car here. I mean, I thought he built his whole car, pretty much he does. He's got incredible factories. I looked at one in Texas, it's unbelievable. All of the manufacturers will build their parts here too. I mean, it used to bother me, they make a part in Canada, a part in Mexico, a part in Europe, and sent all over the place and nobody knew what the hell was happening. I think it's ridic… You build a car, make it in America.\n\n(52:24)And I gave them a little leeway on that, gave them some leeway, but over the next year, they've got to have the whole thing built in America. That's what we want. [inaudible 00:52:36]. We want America to buy American-built cars. Thank you very much.\n\nSpeaker 22 (52:38):\n\nThank you. Thanks guys. You guys [inaudible 00:52:43] out. Right out this way. Thanks guys.",
